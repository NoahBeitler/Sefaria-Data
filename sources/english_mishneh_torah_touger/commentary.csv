Blessings 4.6,"When a person recites a blessing on bread, it also includes -"," This halachah has raised questions among the commentaries. The<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, and others interpret this halachah as referring to the blessings before eating. Thus, with regard to bread, it is to a large part analogous to Halachah 11.</p>
<p>In this context, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> asks why the Rambam did not mention these laws in the context of Chapter 3, Halachot 5-7, which state the rule that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> answers that those halachot describe a situation where the person has no desire to eat the secondary food in its own right and eats it only because of the primary food. In this halachah, the Rambam is speaking about an instance in which one desires to eat the other foods; nevertheless, they are included in the blessing recited over bread because bread includes all other foods.</p>
<p>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> offers a different interpretation, which appears more appropriate to the context in which the laws are discussed. Here, the Rambam is speaking only about the blessing recited after eating."
Blessings 4.6,eaten together with bread -," This does not refer only to instances when these foods are eaten while placed on bread, but also to times when they are eaten at a meal at which bread is served."
Blessings 4.6,"Reciting a blessing on these foods, however, does not include bread. -", The commentaries question why this clause is necessary according to the Rambam's definition of פרפרת. It is obvious that bread would not be considered secondary to any other foods.
Blessings 4.6,includes cooked food. -," Since the cooked grains are considered ""sustaining food"" and have been granted a special blessing which includes (in synopsis) all the blessings of grace, reciting a blessing over them includes other cooked dishes eaten with them.</p>
<p>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> emphasizes that this applies to cooked foods that are eaten together with the grains. Otherwise, it would be difficult to understand how the blessing for the grains could cover foods that require other blessings. Note also the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, which offers an alternate explanation."
Blessings 4.7,A person who decides not to continue eating or drinking -," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pesachim</i> 103b, which states that once a person diverts his attention from drinking wine, he must recite another blessing when he begins drinking again.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad notes that the passage from <i>Pesachim</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions only drinking and does not discuss eating, and on that basis protests against the Rambam's equation of the two. From <i>Berachot</i> 42a, however, it appears that similar principles apply with regard to eating."
Blessings 4.7,although he has not changed his place. -," As mentioned in Halachot 3-5, a person who changes his place while eating must recite both a blessing after the food he has eaten previously and a blessing over the food he plans to eat in his new place.</p>
<p>Many authorities do not accept the Rambam's decision with regard to a meal that includes bread. When a person sits down to such a meal, he is considered to have fixed his attention on eating. People frequently become drawn into eating more than they originally intended at such meals. Thus, a person's decision not to continue eating is not considered final, since it is quite possible that he will change his mind and decide to eat again. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 179:1).</p>
<p>Based on these principles, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 179:1) rules that, although once a person has decided to cease eating or drinking a new blessing is generally required, when partaking of a meal it is not sufficient to make a mental decision, and a person must wash before grace to be considered to have ceased eating."
Blessings 4.7,did not decide [to cease] eating or drinking and had in mind to continue -, eating at a later time
Blessings 4.8,When people who are sitting together -, after having completed a meal
Blessings 4.8,"""Let us recite grace,"" or ""Let us recite kiddush,"" -"," i.e., they were eating on Friday afternoon or the afternoon before a festival. From sunset onward, it is forbidden to continue eating until one recites <i>kiddush</i>. It is, however, possible to recite <i>kiddush</i> early (see <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:11). Once the people agree to recite <i>kiddush</i>, they may no longer continue their meal (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Blessings 4.8,forbidden to continue drinking until they recite grace or kiddush. -," The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 179:2 states that, according to the authorities who differ with the Rambam on the previous halachah, if one's desire to drink stems from having eaten, one may continue to drink at this point."
Blessings 4.8,"before reciting grace or kiddush, they are required to recite the blessing borey pri hagafen before drinking -"," because, as mentioned in the previous halachah, the blessing they recited originally does not cover any drink consumed after they concluded drinking."
Blessings 4.10,A person should not recite a blessing over any food or drink until it is brought before him. -, The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:4) states that a person should hold the food in his right hand before reciting the blessing for it.
Blessings 4.10,"recited a blessing, and then the food was brought before him -"," The blessing is considered to be in vain, and before partaking of the food,"
Blessings 4.10,"When a person took food in his hand and recited a blessing, but [before he could eat it] it fell from his hand and was burned or washed away by a river -", or in any other way became inedible
Blessings 4.10,[This applies] even when the food is of the same species. -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:6) adds, ""and even if the other fruit was before him when he recited the blessing originally."" The Ramah (based on the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>) differs, and maintains that if he originally intended to partake of the other fruit as well, it is included in the first blessing and he should eat it without hesitation so that the blessing will not have to be repeated."
Blessings 4.10,"A person may stand over a stream of water, recite a blessing, and drink. -", The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 6:1) mentions this instance as a contrast to the previous law.
Blessings 4.11,"Foods that are eaten within the meal, because of the meal. -"," The Rambam's statements are quoted, with slight changes, from <i>Berachot</i> 41b. In his commentary on this passage, Rashi defines this first category of foods as relishes eaten with bread. He explains that other foods - e.g., cereals or vegetables - although they are eaten as part of a meal, require an independent blessing.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> differs, and maintains that any food that is eaten as part of a meal - e.g., the foods mentioned by Rashi, meat or fish - is included in this category. Even if they are not eaten with bread, merely at the same meal, they"
Blessings 4.11,"Rather, the blessing hamotzi that is recited in the beginning and the grace recited afterward include everything, because everything is secondary to the meal. -"," This sentence explains the rationale for this ruling. These foods are not eaten casually during the day, but rather are eaten only as part of a meal, with the intent of satiating one's appetite. Accordingly, they are considered as secondary to bread, which is the primary element of the meal (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 177:1). Accordingly, we follow the ruling mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods.</p>
<p>This explanation appears to indicate that the Rambam follows<i>Tosafot's</i> interpretation. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 171:1) also rules accordingly. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:1, however, postulates that it is logical to assume that this ruling applies only when bread is eaten throughout the meal. If only a small amount of bread is eaten at the beginning of a meal, and no bread is eaten while the main course is being eaten, it is questionable whether the blessing over the bread covers these foods."
Blessings 4.11,"require a blessing before partaking of them, but do not require a blessing afterward. -"," Since they are eaten within the meal, they also satisfy a person's appetite. Accordingly, they are included in the blessing that is required by the commandment, ""When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless....""</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:1,3, based on Rabbenu Asher's commentary on <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions two instances when fruit is included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>:</p>
<p>a) When the fruits are eaten on bread itself,<br/>
b) When one eats a meal of fruit - i.e., the fruit is served to satiate one's appetite."
Blessings 4.11,or independent of the meal -,"fruits, desserts, or drinks"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.1,The order of the fulfillment of these mitzvot --," the mitzvot of eating matzah, maror, and <i>charoset</i>, and of relating the story of the Exodus."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.1,is as follows: In the beginning --," It is customary to begin the Seder as soon as possible after nightfall, in order that the children will be able to remain awake and participate in the Seder."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.1,for each individual --, See Halachah 7:7.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.1,Then they drink [it] --," while reclining, as in Halachah 7:8."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.1,A set table is brought --," In the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 1:3, he writes that the table is brought before <i>kiddush</i>. This is also the custom in most homes today, where the Seder plate is brought to the table before <i>kiddush</i>."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.1,"maror, another vegetable --"," to dip in the <i>charoset</i> as <i>karpas,</i> <b>matzah, charoset, the body of the Paschal lamb, and the meat of the festive offering of the fourteenth of Pesach. --</b> The Paschal sacrifice should be eaten after one has been satisfied from eating other foods. Therefore, another sacrifice, a חגיגה (festive offering) was also brought to make up the main body of the festive meal. (See <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 10:12-14.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.1,we bring two types of meat on the table: one in commemoration of the Paschal sacrifice --," The <i>Chidah</i> mentions that it is customary that the meat designated in commemoration of the Paschal sacrifice be roasted in the way that sacrifice was roasted. Rabbenu Manoach writes that it is customary to take the front leg or shank-bone of a lamb as a reference to God's ""outstretched arm.""</p>
<p>It is forbidden to designate an animal as a sacrifice at present. Hence, since many of the common people might think that the shank-bone was actually a Paschal sacrifice, many authorities suggested using a bone from a chicken, a species which was never offered as a sacrifice. Similarly, we are warned not to eat the shank-bone."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.2,He --, the person leading the Seder
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.2,takes the vegetable --," Rabbenu Manoach writes that it is customary to use כרפס (parsley).</p>
<p>This practice is instituted in order to pique the curiosity of the children. (See Halachah 7:3.) They see us beginning to eat without continuing to do so."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.2,and eats a," כזית — The Rambam requires that a כזית be eaten, because the Rabbis instituted the custom of eating the vegetable. The use of the term ""eating"" in halachah implies a minimum of a כזית (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). Nevertheless, this opinion is not accepted. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 473:6, states that less than a כזית should be eaten, in order that no question arise as to whether or not one is obligated to recite a blessing afterwards."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.2,"Afterwards, the table is taken away --"," to arouse the children's curiosity, as explained in Halachah 7:3."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.2,The second cup [of wine] is mixed. --," This also is intended to pique the children's curiosity, for though the wine is poured, it is not drunk until later."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.2,Why is this night different from all other nights?,"</p>
<p>On all other nights, we are not required to dip even once. On this night, we dip twice? — The first three of these four questions are recorded in the Mishnah. It must be noted that the commonly accepted text of the Haggadah follows a different order, quoting that mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a. The order mentioned by the Rambam is found in the Jerusalem Talmud and the codifications of Rabbenu Asher and Rav Yitzchak Alfasi.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the reason for this order is that the first three questions follow the pattern the child sees at the Seder: first we dip (<i>karpas</i>,) then we eat matzah, and then we eat maror.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the expression ""twice"" represents somewhat of a question to the Rambam, who also requires the matzah and the sandwich to be dipped in <i>charoset</i>."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.2,"On all other nights, we eat any type of vegetables. On this","</p>
<p>night, we eat maror (bitter herbs)? - In contrast to the question regarding matzah, we do not say only bitter herbs, for other vegetables are allowed (and even required: for use in the karpas) on Pesach."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.4,The table is returned before him --," It is our custom that the Seder plate is returned immediately after it is taken away, and we recite the entire Haggadah while it is present."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.4,This Paschal sacrifice which we eat --," This statement would be made during the time the Temple was standing and the Paschal sacrifice was actually placed on the table. (See Halachah 8:1.) Nevertheless, in contrast to the maror and the matzah, the Paschal sacrifice was not raised. Perhaps this was because it would be difficult to raise the entire body of the animal."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.4,"He lifts up the maror in his hands and says: This maror that we eat [is] because the Egyptians made the lives of our forefathers bitter in Egypt, as [<a href=""/9862#v14"">Exodus 1:14</a>] states: ""and they embittered their lives."" --"," As mentioned in Halachah 7:5, it is questionable why the Rambam changes the order of matzah and maror from that which is mentioned in the Haggadah itself."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.4,"At present, he says --"," At present, we definitely should not lift up the shank-bone, lest it appear that it was designated as the Passover sacrifice."

In contrast, the latter chapters of Hallel allude to the miracles that will precede the Messianic redemption."

In general, the Sages postulate הידים עסקניות, ""a person's hands are constantly busy,"" and imply that a person is not necessarily conscious of what he touches. Hence, the possibility exists that, in their activity, the hands touched a portion of the body or another substance which requires one to wash."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.6,Afterwards --, See Halachah 8:8 for the present custom.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.6,dips it in charoset --," <i>Pesachim</i> 116a quotes an opinion which explains that dipping the maror in <i>charoset</i> was intended to kill any insects that might be present on it. However, as mentioned in Halachot 7:11 and 8:8, the Rambam considers the <i>charoset</i> a mitzvah in its own right; and, therefore, requires that it be included when the Paschal sacrifice or other foods associated with the mitzvot of the night are eaten."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.6,he recites a blessing for the former --, the matzah
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.7,"Afterwards, he recites the blessing --", because partaking of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is a mitzvah and requires a blessing.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.7,and first --," The <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is eaten before the Paschal sacrifice, in order that the Paschal sacrifice be eaten when one is already satisfied."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.7,"[Then,] he recites the blessing: ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the eating of the Paschal sacrifice"" --"," In this instance as well, in his commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam offers a different version for this blessing: ""who has... commanded us to eat the Paschal sacrifice."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.7,from the body of the Paschal sacrifice --," The Rambam uses the expression, ""the body of the Paschal sacrifice"" in contrast to the ""meat of the <i>Chaggigah</i>"" because, as stated in Halachah 8:1, the entire Paschal sacrifice is brought to the Seder table."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.7,for] the [Chaggigah] offering --," This follows the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Nevertheless, <i>Pesachim</i> 121a quotes Rabbi Yishmael, who offers an alternate opinion.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains these Sages' difference of opinion as follows: The blood of the Paschal sacrifice is to be poured out against the base of the Temple altar. In contrast, the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> should be sprinkled on the two opposite corners of the altar.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yishmael maintains that בדיעבד (after the fact), were a person to pour the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering on the base of the altar, he would be considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Hence, the blessing for the Pesach offering can apply to the <i>Chaggigah</i> as well.</p>
<p>In contrast, Rabbi Akiva maintains that even ""after the fact,"" the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is not acceptable if its blood is not sprinkled on the altar as prescribed. Accordingly, the blessing for the Pesach offering has no connection to the <i>Chaggigah</i> at all.</p>
<p>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's decision. In <i>Hilchot P'sulei HaMukdashim</i> 2:2, the Rambam writes: ""Whenever [blood] is prescribed to be presented [on the altar] by sprinkling, and it was presented by pouring, one has fulfilled his obligation,"" accepting the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. If so, his acceptance of Rabbi Akiva's opinion here appears to present a contradiction.</p>
<p>Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Tz'lach, Pesachim</i> ibid.) attempts to resolve the issue, explaining that the Rambam follows the interpretation of Rav Chayim HaCohen (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> ibid.), who favored a different text of the Talmud and, accordingly, an alternate interpretation of the difference in opinion between the two Sages.</p>
<p>Rav Chayim maintains that Rabbi Yishmael considers the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering as secondary to the Paschal sacrifice. (See also Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7.) Hence, reciting a blessing over the Paschal sacrifice, the essential element (עיקר) of the evening, also fulfills the requirement for the secondary element (טפל), the <i>Chaggigah</i>. Indeed, regarding the blessings recited over food, the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:5) that whenever there are two foods, one essential and one secondary, it is only necessary to recite a blessing over the essential food. A blessing is not required for the secondary item.</p>
<p>This interpretation itself presents a question: Since the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted only for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice and is not an obligation in its own right, it can be considered as ""secondary"" to the Pesach sacrifice. If so, what is the rationale for Rabbi Akiva's opinion?</p>
<p>It can be explained that Rabbi Akiva never considers one mitzvah as secondary to another. We may use the labels ""primary"" and ""secondary"" in regard to matters dependent on our will, but not in regard to mitzvot which we fulfill in obedience to God's desires. Therefore, though the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted because of the Paschal sacrifice, once it has been instituted, it must be considered as a mitzvah in its own right, with its own importance. Hence, it requires a unique blessing of its own (R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch Haggadah)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.8,"At present, when there is no [Paschal] sacrifice, --"," Note the opinions mentioned on p. 34 of the Moznaim edition of <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>, which question whether the Paschal sacrifice can be offered on the Temple Mount even before the Temple is rebuilt."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.8,"then, --"," According to our present custom, the lowest matzah is returned to the Seder plate at this point, so that the following blessing is recited when holding only one complete matzah and the broken half."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.10,"the blessing of song i.e., ""May all Your works praise You, God..."" --"," The Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7, quotes a difference of opinion on this matter. However, the Rambam chooses the blessing which is customarily recited after Hallel.</p>
<p>This represents a change from the Rambam's statements in his commentary on the Mishnah, where he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""the blessing of song"" - this is ""<i>Nishmat kol chay</i>"" until its conclusion. ""May all Your works praise You, God..."" until its conclusion is also called the blessing of song. If one joins the two together, it is praiseworthy.</p>
<p>At present, we follow the custom of joining both blessings together."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.10,"from ""Give thanks to God, for He is good"" until ""By the rivers of Babylon."" This cup is not an obligation like the other cups. --"," Rabbenu Nissim writes that drinking a fifth cup fulfills the mitzvah in the most complete manner. However, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> quotes the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham, as relating that his father would always recite Psalm 136 after the Hallel prayers, and then conclude with the blessing without drinking a fifth cup. Accordingly, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> concludes that although it is permissible to drink a fifth cup, it is not proper to do so.</p>
<p><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXVII, suggests a different interpretation of this halachah, noting that the Rambam does not mention that the fifth cup is drunk. A fifth cup is mixed and placed on the table, and the ""great Hallel"" is recited over it. However, that cup should not be drunk. Thus, the fifth cup is not included as one of the four. Rather, it is a separate and independent obligation.</p>
<p>The Vilna Gaon (see <i>Ta'amei HaMinhagim</i> 551) associates the fifth cup with the cup of Elijah. The Talmud concludes the discussion of many unresolved questions with the statement: תיקו. Literally, the term is a shortened form of the word תיקום, ""let it remain"". However, it is also interpreted as an acrostic for the expression תשבי יתרץ קושיות ואביעות - ""The Tishbite (Elijah) will answer all questions and difficulties.""</p>
<p>Since the requirement of the fifth cup remains an unresolved question, the fifth cup is left for Elijah in the hope that he will come soon and resolve this question as well.</p>
<p>The homiletic aspects of this comment notwithstanding, from a halachic perspective a differentiation must be made between the two. The fifth cup is of Talmudic origin and may be poured for each individual. In contrast, Elijah's cup is an Ashkenazic custom of later origin, and a single cup is used for the whole family. Indeed, they are mentioned by halachists in different chapters of the Shulchan Aruch: the fifth cup by the Ramah in Chapter 481 and Elijah's cup by the <i>Chok Ya'akov</i> in Chapter 480."

Blessings 1.1,It is a positive mitzvah -, <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 19) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 430) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
Blessings 1.1,to bless [God] after eating satisfying food -," The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> and others interpret ""satisfying food"" as referring to bread made from the five species of grain mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 1. Significantly, the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and the <i>Noda BiYhudah</i> maintain that with this expression, the Rambam is implying that the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>, which is recited over other foods made from these species, also has its source in the Torah itself (See also <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 209)."
Blessings 1.1,The Torah itself requires a person to recite grace only when he eats to the point of satiation -," The Rabbis do not specify a standard quantity or measure of food that a person must eat to have reached this state. Rather, they leave the matter up to the person's own feelings."
Blessings 1.1,"The Sages, however, ordained -"," <i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">The angels complained to the Holy One, blessed be He: ""...In Your Torah, it is written [that You] 'will not show favor, nor take bribes,' and yet You show favor to the Jews....""<br/>
God replied: ""Are the Jews not worthy that I show them favor? In My Torah, I have written, ‘When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless,’ and they have nevertheless adopted the stringency of reciting grace after eating an amount equivalent to an olive."""
Blessings 1.2,"Similarly, the Rabbis ordained -"," The definition of this obligation as Rabbinical in nature has aroused questions. <i>Berachot</i> 35a states that this concept can be derived through one of the thirteen principles of Biblical interpretation. Thus, it has all the authority of a Torah law. Though the Rambam (see the Introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, General Principle 2) refers to laws derived in this manner as מדברי סופרים - literally, ""from the words of our Sages,"" the same term used here - his intent is not to imply that the law did not originate in the Torah itself.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot,</i> loc. cit.), however, explain that the Talmud ultimately does not accept the interpretation that the obligation is derived from the Torah, and maintain that the obligation to recite blessings is Rabbinic in origin. Even according to these opinions, it appears that the Sages ordained the recitation of blessings rather early in our national history. Midrashim referring to the age of King David explicitly mention the recitation of blessings, and there are intimations of this obligation in references to earlier periods. See also the commentary on Halachah 5."
Blessings 1.2,Even when one wants to eat the slightest amount of food or drink -," i.e., less than a <i>k'zayit</i> or a <i>revi'it</i>"
Blessings 1.2,"Similarly, when smelling a pleasant fragrance, one should recite a blessing -", See Chapter 9 with regard to the particular blessings required.
Blessings 1.2,Anyone who derives benefit [from this world] without reciting a blessing is considered as if he misappropriated a sacred article. -," <i>Berachot</i> 35a explains that the entire world belongs to God, as <a href=""/16245#v1"">Psalms 24:1</a> declares: ""The earth and its fullness are God's."" Although God allows man to benefit from this world, that license is granted only when man acknowledges God's control by reciting a blessing."
Blessings 1.2,and eats a k'zayit. -," Anything less is not considered significant enough to require a blessing afterwards. A blessing beforehand must nevertheless be recited, because ""it is forbidden to benefit from this world without a blessing.""</p>
<p>There is, however, a law which appears to be an exception to this principle:"
Blessings 1.3,Just as we recite blessings for benefit which we derive from the world -," as explained above,"
Blessings 1.3,"Similarly, the Sages instituted many blessings as expressions of praise and thanks to God and as a means of petition -", See Chapter 10.
Blessings 1.5,The text of all the blessings was ordained by Ezra and his court. -," <i>Berachot</i> 33a explains that when the Men of the Great Assembly established the text of the prayer service (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 1:4), they also established the text for the various blessings and for <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdalah</i>.</p>
<p>This, however, does not mean that the blessings were not recited beforehand. Rather, just as explained with regard to prayer, before Ezra's time each person would recite the blessings according to his own inspiration and ability to express himself. In Ezra's time, many people had difficulty expressing themselves eloquently and, therefore, Ezra and his court established a standard text."
Blessings 1.5,"to add to it, or to detract from it. Whoever alters the text of a blessing from that ordained by the Sages is making an error. -"," The Radbaz (Vol. 5, Responsum 1424) states that as long as the person mentions God's name, His sovereignty over the world, and the subject of the blessing, he fulfills his obligation even if he does not use the text ordained by the Sages. (This interpretation is borne out by the next halachah.)</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's phraseology alludes to two types of changes:<br/>
a) Changes which do not substantially alter the blessing from the text ordained by the Sages. With regard to such changes, the Rambam uses the expression ""it is not fit,"" which implies that although the person's deed is not desirable, he fulfills his obligation.<br/>
b) A change of an innovative nature which alters the text of the blessing entirely. These changes the Rambam considers as ""errors"" which prevent a person from fulfilling his obligation. See also Halachah 13, <i>Berachot</i> 40b, and <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:7."
Blessings 1.5,and His sovereignty [over the world]-," i.e., the phrase מלך העולם (King of the universe),"
Blessings 1.6,All the blessings may be recited in any language -," Although the text ordained by Ezra and his court was in Hebrew, there is no absolute requirement to use that language"
Blessings 1.6,[A person who] changes that text -, reciting a different blessing from that ordained by the Sages
Blessings 1.7,"A person should recite all the blessings loud enough for him to hear what he is saying. Nevertheless, a person who does not recite a blessing out loud fulfills his obligation, whether he verbalizes the blessing -", pronouncing the words with his lips
Blessings 1.8,"Whenever one recites a blessing, one should not make an interruption between the blessing and the subject for which the blessing is recited. -", This applies with regard to both blessings recited before food and blessings recited before performing a mitzvah.
Blessings 1.8,"If, however, one makes an interruption which relates to the subject of the blessing, one does not have to repeat the blessing. -"," The Rambam's phraseology appears to indicate that, at the outset, one should not make any interruption. If, however, the situation demands that an interruption be made or if one inadvertently does so, the blessing need not be repeated when it is of the following nature."
Blessings 1.9,A person who is ritually impure is permitted to recite all the blessings. -," In <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 4:8, the Rambam states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">The words of Torah never contract impurity. Rather, they remain pure forever, as [<a href=""/16020#v29"">Jeremiah 23:29</a>] states: ""Are not My words as fire...."" Just as fire can never contract impurity, the words of Torah never contract impurity.</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4, the Rambam applies these same principles to the words of prayer."
Blessings 1.9,or not. -," There are some impurities - e.g., the impurity of a זב or the impurity resulting from contact with a human corpse - which require an extended period of time and other rituals besides immersion to regain ritual purity. (See also <i>Berachot</i> 3:4-6 and the Rambam's commentary on those <i>Mishnayot</i>.)"
Blessings 1.9,To whom does this apply? To men -," whose genitals protrude. In contrast,"
Blessings 1.10,[The following principle applies to] all blessings: Although a person has already recited them and fulfilled his own obligation -," In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the same principle applies when the person reciting the blessing has not fulfilled his obligation, but does not desire to do so at the present time."
Blessings 1.10,so that they can fulfill their obligation. -," The Rambam describes the manner in which the listener fulfills his obligation in the next halachah.</p>
<p>For the above principle to apply, however, the listener must be obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. When the listener is not obligated - e.g., a woman for shofar blowing - a person should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated himself (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 589:6)."
Blessings 1.10,"In this instance, one may not recite a blessing for others unless one enjoys benefit together with them. -"," In this instance, there is no obligation for a person to partake of this food. Hence, the principle of ערבות does not apply (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) unless the person reciting the blessing also desires to partake of the food. Should he desire to do so, the blessing he recites may include others as well. (Note an alternate explanation in the commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 16.)"
Blessings 1.10,for others -," since, in this instance, the only way the mitzvah can be fulfilled is by eating the food.</p>
<p>Note the <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 273, which states that, at the outset, a person who has already recited <i>kiddush</i> should not recite <i>kiddush</i> for others, unless they are incapable of doing so themselves."
Blessings 1.11,Whenever a person listens to the entire recitation of a blessing with the intention of fulfilling his obligation -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:3) rules that the person reciting the blessing also must intend that the listener fulfill his obligation by hearing the blessing.</p>
<p>The <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> 213 explain that this ruling points to a question of a larger scope: Do mitzvot of the Rabbis require intention, or is it possible to fulfill one's obligation by performing the required act without any intent.</p>
<p>According to the latter view, although the person reciting the blessing does not have the intention of fulfilling the obligation of the listener, since ""one who listens is considered as though he responded,"" the listener is considered to have recited the blessing, and thus to have fulfilled his obligation.</p>
<p>In contrast, the former view requires that one have a conscious desire to fulfill one's obligation when fulfilling a Rabbinic obligation. Since the person reciting the blessing did not have such an intention on behalf of the listener, the listener cannot fulfill his obligation."
Blessings 1.11,Whoever answers Amen to a blessing recited by another person is considered as if he recited the blessing himself -," <i>Berachot</i> 53b mentions two opinions, one which equates the person answering<i>Amen</i> with the person actually reciting the blessing (the opinion cited by the Rambam), and one which considers the person answering to be on an even higher level.</p>
<p>Thus, with this statement, the Rambam is explaining that, although a person can fulfill his obligation by listening without answering <i>Amen</i>, when he answers he is considered as if he actually recited the blessing himself (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Blessings 1.11,If the person who recites the blessing is obligated only because of a Rabbinic ordinance -," e.g., an adult male who has not eaten to the point of satiation"
Blessings 1.11,the listener cannot fulfill his obligation until he repeats -, word for word
Blessings 1.12,"When many people gather together to eat [a meal with] bread or to drink wine, and one recites the blessing -"," Our translation follows the standard text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. According to the source for this law, <i>Berachot</i> 6:6, and the manner it is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:11), it should read, ""one person should recite the blessing."" This is the preferred manner for the group to bless their food, because ""within the multitude of people is the glory of the king"" (<a href=""/16385#v28"">Proverbs 14:28)</a>.</p>
<p><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 167:18 relates that today, even when eating a meal as a group, it is customary for each person to recite the blessing over bread himself, so that an interruption is not made between the recitation of the blessing and partaking of the food."
Blessings 1.12,"If, however, they did not intend to eat together, but rather they each came on their own initiative, although they all eat from a single loaf of bread, each one should recite the blessings [before eating] by himself. -"," Although this is the desired practice, if one answers <i>Amen</i> to another person's blessing, he fulfills his obligation, as stated in the previous halachah.</p>
<p>This reflects the position of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13). The <i>Magen Avraham</i>, however, differs, and maintains that one cannot fulfill his obligation to recite blessings that involve benefit unless one had the intention of eating together with the other person and responding to his blessings. This view takes a more lenient position regarding blessings over mitzvot, which we are obligated to fulfill, than regarding the blessings over food, which we are not obligated to eat."
Blessings 1.13,"Whenever a person hears a Jew recite a blessing, he is obligated -"," This represents a difference of opinion between the Rambam and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 215), who considers responding<i>Amen</i> a matter left to our own volition. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 215:2) quotes the Rambam's opinion. Furthermore, the <i>Magen Avrahamh</i> 6:9 mentions an obligation to recite<i>Amen</i> ninety times each day."
Blessings 1.13,although a) he did not hear the blessing in its entirety -, but merely its conclusion. See also the commentary on the last clause of the following halachah.
Blessings 1.13,an apostate -," Since, ""It can be assumed that an apostate has false gods in mind (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 2:5),"" we are forbidden to respond to his blessings."
Blessings 1.13,a child in the midst of study -," and recites blessings for practice. When a child recites a blessing with the intent of fulfilling his obligation, however, it is appropriate to respond <i>Amen</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 215:3)."
Blessings 1.14,"Whenever responding Amen, one should not recite a rushed Amen -"," Our translation is based on the interpretation of the <i>Aruch</i>, which explains that this means that a person should not answer <i>Amen</i> before the one reciting the blessing has concluded its recitation.</p>
<p>Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 47a) interprets this to mean that one substitutes a <i>chataf patach</i> (:-) for a <i>kamatz</i> in the vocalization of the <i>Alef</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 124:8) accepts both interpretations as halachah."
Blessings 1.14,nor a short or a prolonged Amen -," <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states, ""Whoever prolongs the recitation of <i>Amen</i> errs,"" since by doing so one distorts the pronunciation of the word (<i>Tosafot</i>)."
Blessings 1.14,One should not raise one's voice above that of the person reciting the blessing. -," <i>Berachot</i> 45a states that this law is derived from <a href=""/16255#v4"">Psalms 34:4</a>: ""Exalt God <b>with</b> me and let us extol His name <b>together</b>."""
Blessings 1.15,Whoever recites a blessing for which he is not obligated is considered as if he took God's name in vain. -," See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 12:9-10, where the Rambam states that a person who intentionally recites a blessing in vain should be placed under a ban of ostracism.</p>
<p>Note Chapter 4, Halachah 10, which states that after reciting an unnecessary blessing, one should praise God, saying, ""Blessed be the Name of Him whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever"" so that his mention of God's name will not be in vain."
Blessings 1.15,and it is forbidden to answer Amen after his blessing. -," For this reason, it is forbidden to recite a blessing unnecessarily - e.g., to recite two blessings when a single blessing is sufficient. Similarly, for this reason, a person who is unsure of whether or not he is obligated to recite a blessing should not recite it, lest he recite a blessing in vain.</p>
<p>Despite the severity of the prohibition against taking God's name in vain"
Blessings 1.15,One should not recite Amen after their blessings. -," The source of this halachah, <i>Berachot</i> 53b, indicates that this law applies only when the children are reciting the blessings for practice. When they are reciting the blessings to fulfill their obligation, we should respond <i>Amen</i>."
Blessings 1.16,It is demeaning for a person to recite Amen after his own blessings. -," This does not refer to the recitation of a single blessing (which is discussed in Halachah 18), but the recitation of<i>Amen</i> after each blessing recited in a series of blessings. Reciting <i>Amen</i> is considered demeaning because it implies a conclusion of one's prayers. It is not proper to conclude and begin, conclude and begin, several times in one series (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Blessings 1.16,"e.g., after the blessing Boneh Yerushalayim in grace -"," The third blessing in grace. Note also the following halachah. This example is explicitly mentioned by <i>Berachot</i> 45b, the source for this halachah."
Blessings 1.17,Why is Amen recited after the blessing Boneh Yerushalayim although it is followed by the blessing Hatov v'hametiv? -," On the surface, the latter blessing, and not the blessing <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i>, marks the conclusion of the blessings of grace."
Blessings 1.17,and is considered to be an addition. The conclusion of the essential blessings of grace is Boneh Yerushalayim. -," Hence <i>Amen</i> is recited at this point. As mentioned in the commentary on the previous halachah, its recitation differentiates between the blessings required by the Torah and those instituted by the Rabbis."
Blessings 1.17,Because it is the conclusion of the blessings recited before the Shema -, and an interruption should not be made between these blessings and the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.
Blessings 1.18,Why is Amen not recited after the blessing over fruits and the like? -," The Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that the Rambam is not referring to the blessing recited before partaking of fruit. All agree that one should not recite <i>Amen</i> after such a blessing, because <i>Amen</i> would constitute an interruption between the blessing and partaking of the fruit. Rather, the Rambam is speaking about the blessing <i>al hapairot</i> or other similar blessings.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam on this matter and suggests that a person should recite <i>Amen</i> after concluding any of these blessings. The later authorities, however, accept the Rambam's decision."
Blessings 1.18,or the blessings of the High Priest -, The series of eight blessings recited by the High Priest after reading from the Torah during the Temple service on Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 3:11).
Blessings 1.19,When a person eats a forbidden food - whether consciously or inadvertently - he should not recite a blessing beforehand or afterward. -," It is improper to bless God after transgressing His commandments. On the contrary, concerning a similar incident, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 1:5) cites <a href=""/16231#v3"">Psalms 10:3</a>, ""A thief who recites a blessing disgusts God."" Even an inadvertent violation of the law is an act against His will for which it is not appropriate to bless Him.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad and Rabbenu Asher differ with the Rambam's decision and maintain that the fact that a person violates a commandment against eating forbidden food should not cause him to violate another commandment and benefit from the world without praising God. The<i>Turei Zahav</i> 196:1 attempts to resolve the two views and offers a compromise: A person who intentionally violates a prohibition should not recite a blessing. If, however, a person eats a forbidden food inadvertently, he should recite a blessing afterwards.</p>
<p>Significantly, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 196) explains that even the Rambam would agree that a sick person who is required to eat a forbidden food for medicinal purposes should recite a blessing. There are, however, authorities who differ with this ruling as well."
Blessings 1.19,even food that is classified as tevel by Rabbinical decree -," e.g., produce that grows in containers. According to Torah law, the agricultural gifts are required to be given only from produce that grows in the earth itself (Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Berachot</i> 7:1)."
Blessings 1.19,or the second tithe -," which must be eaten in Jerusalem. If this is not possible, the food can be redeemed and the money brought to Jerusalem to purchase food there. It is forbidden to eat this food outside Jerusalem until it is redeemed (<a href=""/9978#v22"">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>-27). In this instance, we are speaking about a situation where the redemption was improperly performed - e.g., one used uncoined metal (the Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Berachot</i> 7:1)."
Blessings 1.19,"that were not redeemed in the proper manner,-"," They were redeemed using landed property, which is unacceptable (<i>loc. cit.</i>)."
Blessings 1.19,or was trefah -," An animal attacked by a wild beast or diseased and therefore suffering from an affliction that will cause it to die within twelve months (<i>Hilchot Shechitah</i>, Chapter 5)."
Human Dispositions 1.1,Each and every man possesses many character traits. Each trait is very different and distant from the others. -," Many commentaries assume that the Rambam is stating simply that there are many personality types, which he proceeds to describe: e.g., the angry man, the calm man, etc. They quote various sources in support of this viewpoint, among them <i>Berachot</i> 58a: ""Whoever sees a multitude of Jews recites the blessing: 'Blessed is...the wise who knows the hidden secrets,' because just as their natures are not similar, neither are their faces.""</p>
<p>However, by stating that the many character traits are possessed by ""each and every man,"" it is possible that Rambam is implying more than that there are people with different traits. Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other. Anger, generosity, and modesty, for example, can be found together in the same person, much in the same way that tenants of all sorts - unrelated to each other - can be housed in a common building.</p>
<p>To illustrate these traits, the Rambam employs concrete examples of extreme personalities, so that the contrasts can be appreciated more easily."
Human Dispositions 1.1,"or, if at all, he will be slightly angry, [perhaps once] during a period of several years.<br/>",
Human Dispositions 1.1,"There is the man ruled by his appetites, who will never be satisfied from pursuing his desires - <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 1:34 states: ""No person will die having accomplished [even] half of what he desires."" This statement is difficult to comprehend since there appear to be many successful individuals who achieve their desires. Nevertheless, their accomplishments do not necessitate that their desires will be satisfied. As the <i>Midrash</i> continues: ""A person who possesses 100 silver pieces desires 200. One who possesses 200 desires 400.""<br/>",
Human Dispositions 1.1,"and [conversely,] the very pure of heart, who does not desire even the little that the body needs. -"," This pair of contrasting personality types deal with a person's appetites which can be satisfied by sensual experience. For example, gluttony is stimulated and satisfied by taste. In contrast, the traits mentioned below - the desire for money or the lack of desire for it - do not involve the senses."
Human Dispositions 1.1,"with all the money in the world, as [<a href=""/16466#v9"">Ecclesiastes 5:9</a>] states: ""A lover of money never has his fill of money."" -"," Here, the Rambam describes an example where the desire for money becomes a goal in itself. In contrast, a man who gathers money so that he can buy things or achieve power is not interested in money per se. Although he may be faulted for different reasons, he is not greedy for money. On the other hand, for the ""lover of money,"" money itself becomes his raison d'etre."
Human Dispositions 1.1,"he is satisfied with even a little, which is not enough for his needs, and he does not bother to pursue and attain what he lacks. -"," This refers to a lazy person, who will not bestir himself even for that which is necessary. In Chapter 2, Halachah 7, this type is described clearly as: ""lazy and an idler."" This is the description, too, in the Rambam's Introduction to <i>Avot - Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4."
Human Dispositions 1.1,"Whenever he spends a penny of his own, he does so with great pain. [Conversely,] there is [the spendthrift,] who consciously wastes his entire fortune. - <i>Chullin</i> 84b gives examples of such behavior: wearing linen clothing, using glass utensils, and hiring workers without supervising them.<br/>",
Human Dispositions 1.1,the stingy and the freehanded -," Our translation of <i>shua</i> is clearly evident from <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 7:11. It follows that <i>chili</i> represents the opposite extreme. (See also Ibn Ezra, <a href=""/15963#v5"">Isaiah 32:5</a>.)</p>
<p>The difference between this pair of traits and the miser-spendthrift pair mentioned above is that the latter refers to a person's conduct toward himself, while the former refers to his conduct with regard to others. The stingy man, unlike the miser, may spend money for his own needs, but is tightfisted when others are concerned. By the same token, a freehanded man need not necessarily indulge himself, though he is generous when giving charity. Though this may sound praiseworthy, when taken to extremes it can also prove dangerous, because a person may hurt himself in the process of giving excessively to another. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)"
Human Dispositions 1.2,"Between each trait and the [contrasting] trait at the other extreme, there are intermediate points, each distant from the other. -"," The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> understands this as follows: Let us imagine a line drawn from one extreme to another - between the stingy and the freehanded, for example. All who are neither stingy nor freehanded stand between them. They are all intermediate, whether they tend towards stinginess or freehandedness. Each point along this imaginary line stands apart - ""is distant"" - from the others on that line. In a diagram, this idea might be depicted as follows:<br/>
X-----*-------*------*-------*----------*---------*X<br/>
Stingy intermediate points freehanded.</p>
<p>However, it is highly unlikely that all the Rambam wishes to teach us is that there are many intermediate points of temperament between the extremes. After all, that is self-evident. Furthermore, in each set of associated temperaments - for example, stinginess and freehandedness - only three points on the line are of importance to the Rambam in clarifying his view of personality development: the two extremes and the midpoint. Why should he mention all the other intermediate possibilities?</p>
<p>Thus, it appears that the Rambam is telling us that there is a midpoint temperament between each pair of contrasting extremes. Given the entire range of human temperaments, there are a number of midpoints which are not necessarily related to each other. For example, the midpoint for generosity may be very different from the midpoint for humility. Thus, in Halachah 1, the Rambam stated that our personality traits are ""different and distant;"" in this halachah, he makes a parallel statement about the midpoints."
Human Dispositions 1.2,in accordance with his bodily nature. -," Here, we see an interrelation between body and soul. Certain temperaments are produced by or relate to particular physical characteristics.</p>
<p>[In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam states: ""From the outset of a person's [life], he has neither virtues nor vices...."" However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> and this halachah. The possession of certain character traits does not determine whether one will use them for a vice or a virtue.]"
Human Dispositions 1.2,Some traits he does not have from birth. He may have learned them from others -," In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam writes: ""From his youth, one becomes accustomed to acting in accordance with the accepted behavior of one's family and locale."" In these few words, the Rambam includes all the people who might influence a person's character development: his parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and others. Also, note Chapter 6, Halachah 1."
Human Dispositions 1.2,a) This may have come as a result of his own thoughts -," i.e., an intuitive realization of the correctness of a certain course of behavior stemming from one's own creative thought."
Human Dispositions 1.3,"The two extremes of each trait, which are at a distance from one another, do not reflect a proper path -"," i.e., the path described in this and the following halachot."
Human Dispositions 1.3,that a man should behave in accordance with these extremes -, if that his nature
Human Dispositions 1.3,If he finds that his nature leans towards one of the extremes -," i.e., a genetic trait, as mentioned in the previous halachah"
Human Dispositions 1.3,"or, if he has learned one of the extremes -", the third type of trait mentioned in the previous halachah.
Human Dispositions 1.3,and walk in the path of the good [men]. -," i.e., the path that good men follow. This translation is based on the fact that the word ""path"" is in the singular, while the modifier ""good"" is in the plural."
Human Dispositions 1.4,The straight path -," This expression is also used in <i>Avot</i> 2:1. In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam cites his explanation of the middle path in the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>."
Human Dispositions 1.4,"This refers to the trait which is equidistant from either of the extremes, without being close to either of them. -"," These statements echo the opening remarks of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">The good acts are those balanced ones midway between two extremes. Both of the extremes are bad - one reflects excess and the other, want. The virtues [good traits] are temperaments and habits which are midway between these two bad tendencies.<br/>
These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits.</p>
<p>Despite the similarity between the Rambam's statements here and those quoted, there is a slight difference. Here, the Rambam focuses on good traits, while in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, he emphasizes good actions."
Human Dispositions 1.4,to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path -," At the conclusion of Chapter 4 of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">When a man weighs his actions constantly and directs them towards their midpoints, he will be on the most elevated human plane possible. He will thereby approach God and grasp His will. This is the most perfect path in the service of God.</p>
<p>Constant introspection is a necessary element in any program of personal and spiritual growth. Even when a person has the highest goals, unless he frequently looks himself squarely in the mirror and examines his behavior, he may make gross errors."
Human Dispositions 1.4,"For example: he should not be wrathful, easily angered; nor be like the dead, without feeling, rather he should [adopt] an intermediate course; i.e., he should display anger -"," Our translation is based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3. (Note also the commentary of the <i>Knesset HaGedolah</i>.)"
Human Dispositions 1.4,in order to prevent the matter from recurring.<br/>,
Human Dispositions 1.4,"anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [<a href=""/16384#v25"">Proverbs 13:25</a>] states -"," The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the ""intermediate traits;"" perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.</p>
<p>However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. <a href=""/9972#v10"">Deuteronomy 8:10</a> teaches: ""You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord."" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.</p>
<p>Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess. This is a dominant theme in the sections on diet in Chapter 4, and those describing the conduct of a Torah sage in Chapter 5."
Human Dispositions 1.4,"Also, he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [<a href=""/16258#v16"">Psalms 37:16</a>] states: -"," Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions.</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note <a href=""/16377#v6"">Proverbs 6:6</a>: ""Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;"" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: ""If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good"" (<a href=""/16349#v2"">Psalms 128:2)</a>.<br/>
""You are fortunate"" - in this life, and ""will possess the good"" - in the world to come.</p>
<p>The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11. Thus, the Rambam is not criticizing a person for working hard, but rather teaching us that work and its profits should not be our greatest priorities."
Human Dispositions 1.4,He should not be overly stingy -," The printed editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> have <i>yikfotz</i> (close his hand). However, most manuscripts use the term: <i>yikabetz</i> (gather).</p>
<p><i>Yikfotz</i> recalls <a href=""/9979#v7"">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>: ""Do not close your hand from your needy brother."" Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift. The variant texts might reflect a difference of opinion as to which opposing extremes the Rambam had in mind."
Human Dispositions 1.4,and lend to the needy as is fitting -," Lending is also a form of charity. In <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 10:7, the Rambam lists eight degrees of charity. The highest is the support of a fellow Jew who has become poor by giving him loans or the like."
Human Dispositions 1.4,"nor be sad and depressed in spirit. Rather, he should be quietly happy at all times -"," his joy should be a composed sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>[In this context, see the Ramah's conclusion of his notes to <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (697:1) in which he quotes <a href=""/16386#v15"">Proverbs 15:15</a>: ""A good-hearted person is always celebrating.""]"
Human Dispositions 1.4,The same applies with regard to his other traits. -," In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam mentions many other ""intermediate traits."" Among them:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Courage is the midpoint between arrogance and fear. Humility is the intermediate between pride and meekness. Earnestness is the intermediate between boasting and lowliness....Patience is the intermediate between rashness and insensitivity..."
Human Dispositions 1.5,A person who carefully [examines] his [behavior] -, in an effort to achieve the desired intermediate path
Human Dispositions 1.5,to either side is called pious. -," In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam explains that one can refine and correct his behavior by balancing a tendency for excess in one direction by intentionally forcing oneself to adopt the opposite extreme. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.) He continues:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner. However, the difference between them is that the behavior of the pious is carefully calculated with the intent of refining his personality, while the underdeveloped person does so without thought, as a natural response to his whims and fancies."
Human Dispositions 1.5,One who shuns pride -," At first glance, the choice of pride as an example is rather problematic, because in Chapter 2, Halachah 3, the Rambam states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">There are traits for which it is forbidden for a person to follow an intermediate path.... Such a trait is pride...<br/>
The proper path is not that a person should merely be humble, but rather hold himself very lowly...<br/>
Therefore, our Sages commanded: ""Be very, very humble of spirit.""</p>
<p>It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary on the halachah cited above.</p>
<p>Possibly, it is the exaggerated contrasts in this set of traits that make it the most fitting example to demonstrate the principle of the middle path that the Rambam espouses. These gross differences allow for the possibility of clear distinctions."
Human Dispositions 1.5,and carries himself lowly is called pious. This is the quality of piety -, which represents a deviation from the mean.
Human Dispositions 1.5,The same applies with regard to other character traits. -," i.e., there is a mean which is the path of wisdom, and a deviation from that course with a positive intent, which is the path of piety."
Human Dispositions 1.5,"would bend their temperaments from the intermediate path towards [either of] the two extremes. For some traits, they would veer towards the final extreme -"," excess (<i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4)"
Human Dispositions 1.5,This is referred to -, by our Sages...
Human Dispositions 1.5,We are commanded -," The <i>Sifre</i> (on <a href=""/9977#v5"">Deuteronomy 13:5)</a> states: 'You shall walk after God, your Lord' - this is a positive commandment."" The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tetze</i>, p. 270) also makes a similar statement. However, neither source elaborates.</p>
<p>Among the <i>Geonim</i>, the <i>Ba'al Halachot Gedolot</i> does list it as a commandment. Rav Sa'adiah Gaon does not include it as a specific commandment.</p>
<p><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 610) include this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. However, the Rambam's inclusion of this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot is somewhat problematic. In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any ""general mitzvah"" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, ""Observe My statutes"" (<a href=""/9920#v19"">Leviticus 19:19)</a> or ""Be holy"" (<a href=""/9920#v2"">Leviticus 19:2)</a> are not included in the 613 mitzvot. On the surface, the command the Rambam mentions here also seems to be an all encompassing charge to develop ourselves spiritually without any specific activity.</p>
<p>Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, was asked this question, and he explained that here the specific activity implied by this commandment is the development of our emotions and character traits. A somewhat deeper perspective can be gained from the Rambam's own description of the mitzvah. When listing the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot, he states that the mitzvah is ""to imitate God's ways"" and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he defines the mitzvah as ""to imitate Him, blessed be He, according to our potential.""</p>
<p>The implication of these statements is that man has a constant obligation to carry out all of his deeds and guide the progress of his emotional development with the intent of imitating God. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot, Tavo</i> 5748, and note the commentary on the following halachah.)"
Human Dispositions 1.5,"and they are good and straight paths - as [<a href=""/9992#v9"">Deuteronomy 28:9</a>] states: ""And you shall walk in His ways."" -"," The Rambam describes this mitzvah in the following halachah. Indeed, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include the paragraph we have just explained as the beginning of Halachah 6.</p>
<co:rambam_commentary halacha=""6"">
<p>As emphasized in the introduction to this text, the Rambam has structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intent of ""revealing all the laws to the great and to the small with regard to each and every mitzvah."" He does not mention philosophical and ethical concepts unless they are halachot - i.e., practical directives for our behavior.</p>
<p>In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God's ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve. Having laid down this foundation, he is able to define that mitzvah in this halachah and begin offering directives for its fulfillment in Halachah 7."
Human Dispositions 1.5,"Just as He is called ""Gracious,"" you shall be gracious; Just as He is called ""Merciful,"" you shall be merciful; Just as He is called ""Holy,"" you shall be holy; -"," Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is ""piety."" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion."
Human Dispositions 1.5,"called God by other titles: ""Slow to anger,"" ""Abundant in kindness,"" ""Righteous,"" ""Just,"" ""Perfect,"" ""Almighty,"" ""Powerful,"" and the like. -"," In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.</p>
<p>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as ""slow to anger."" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent."
Human Dispositions 1.5,"A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought. As explained above, God cannot be described by any particular quality. If He manifests a quality, it is for a specific intent.<br/>",
Human Dispositions 1.5,How can one train himself to follow these temperaments to the extent that they become a permanent fixture of his [personality]? -," Having established personality development as a mitzvah in the previous halachah, the Rambam begins his explanation of how this mitzvah is fulfilled."

<p>For example, a liberal man gives charity naturally; the miser must force himself to give. The action for each is the same, but not the inner feelings."
Human Dispositions 1.5,Since the Creator -," The Rambam uses the term <i>yotzer</i> - literally ""the One who forms"" - (which appears only one other time in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:7).</p>
<p>The Rambam describes God as the Creator with reference to the Divine qualities he describes in these halachot. Before the existence of the world and man, there would be no purpose for God to reveal these qualities, for until man's creation, no one could learn from or emulate them.</p>
<p>[The word <i>yotzer</i> may also be used because of its connection to the word <i>yeitzer</i>, meaning drive or inclination. (See Rashi, <a href=""/8166#v7"">Genesis 2:7</a>.)]"
Human Dispositions 1.5,This is [the heritage] which our Patriarch Abraham taught his descendants -," See the <i>Midrash Tanchumah, Shofetim</i> 15:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">And what are the ways of God? Righteousness and justice, as it is stated: ""And they will keep the path of God to do righteousness and justice"" (<a href=""/8213#v19"">Genesis 18:19)</a>."
Human Dispositions 1.6,[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah -," The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (<a href=""/9875#v2"">Exodus 14:2)</a> and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.</p>
<p>It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">[<a href=""/9977#v5"">Deuteronomy 13:5</a> states]: ""You shall walk after God, your Lord."" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: ""Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire"" (<a href=""/9968#v24"">Deuteronomy 4:24)</a>?<br/>
Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.<br/>
Just as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;<br/>
God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;<br/>
God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;<br/>
God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.</p>
<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.</p>
<p>There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the ""resemblance of God"" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment."
Human Dispositions 1.6,"In a similar manner, the prophets -"," The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent."
Human Dispositions 1.6,[They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths. -," i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve."

Fringes 3.1,A garment to which the Torah obligates a person to attach tzitzit -," With this expression, the Rambam could be alluding to the concept that a person is not obligated to wear tzitzit. Should a person desire to wear a garment of the type that requires tzitzit, then he has the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah. See Halachot 10-11."

Fringes 3.5,"For a garment of wool, the white strands should be made of wool -", alone.
Fringes 3.5,For garments of other [fabrics] -," As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 2, there is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis whether garments made from fabrics other than wool or linen require tzitzit or not. According to the opinions which maintain that they do, the concepts that follow are derived from the exegesis of a Biblical verse. (See <i>Menachot</i> 39b.) According to the Rambam, who maintains that the requirement of tzitzit on these garments is Rabbinic in origin, we must assume that these concepts were part of the Rabbinic ordinance requiring tzitzit for these garments (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Fringes 3.5,"For example, silk strands should be used for a silk garment, strands of goats' wool should be used for garments of goats' wool. -"," If one chooses to make tzitzit from these fabrics, one should use them for all four tzitzit. It is questionable whether it is acceptable to make some of the tzitzit of a specific garment from wool and others from the fabric of which the garment is made (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 9:4)."
Fringes 3.5,"for [garments of] any type [of fabric], one may -"," <i>Menachot</i>, ibid., derives this concept from the fact that <a href=""/9986#v12"">Deuteronomy 22:12</a> mentions the mitzvah to attach tzitzit to our garments directly after the mention of the prohibition of making garments of wool and linen. Our Sages explain, that although mixtures of wool and linen are forbidden in general, such a mixture is required in tzitzit. (See the following two halachot.) Therefore, whenever tzitzit are made, either of these two fabrics may be used."
Fringes 3.6,What is the ruling regarding making woolen strands for a garment of linen or linen strands for a garment of wool - even though we are speaking only of the white strands without techelet? -," It appears that the Rambam is asking about attaching tzitzit that have only white strands, without attaching <i>techelet</i>. Thus, one can conclude that when attaching tzitzit to a linen garment, it is forbidden to make the white strands of wool even though one includes a woolen strand of<i>techelet</i>. Though the prohibition against <i>sha'atnez</i> is lifted for this garment, it is lifted only when there is no alternative but to do so (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Fringes 3.6,"is permitted to be used for tzitzit, as evident from the fact that techelet is made using woolen strands -"," Chapter 2, Halachot 1- 2."

Fringes 3.6,"Whenever [a conflict exists] between the observance of a positive commandment and the adherence to a negative commandment, [the following rules apply:] -"," The following are general rules which apply, not only regarding tzitzit, but in other circumstances as well: for example, <i>Hilchot Milah</i> 1:9."
Fringes 3.6,"one should. If not, the observance of the positive commandment supersedes the negative commandment. -"," Rav Nissim Gaon explains that although the violation of a negative commandment receives a more severe punishment than the failure to observe a positive commandment, when God originally gave the negative commandments, He prescribed that they do not apply when adherence to them causes the performance of a positive commandment to be nullified.</p>
<p>The <i>Tanya</i> (<i>Iggeret HaTeshuvah</i>, Chapter 1) explains the rationale for this principle. Man's purpose in this world is to spread Godly light through the observance of mitzvot. Accordingly, the observance of these mitzvot is always given preference when there is such a conflict.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that one must fulfill the mitzvah at the time one is violating the transgression. It is forbidden, however, in order to break a commandment to later perform a mitzvah."
Fringes 3.7,Techelet should not be attached to a linen garment. -, This decree was imposed even when <i>techelet</i> was available.
Fringes 3.7,"This is not because [the prohibition against] sha'atnez supersedes [the mitzvah of] tzitzit, but rather it is a Rabbinical decree -"," The Rabbis have the power to ordain that a person bypass the performance of a Torah commandment.

Fringes 3.7,"when one is not required to wear tzitzit, and thus violate a negative commandment when the performance of a positive commandment is not involved. -"," See <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 10:32, which mentions a similar concept regarding the priestly garments. The sash worn by the priests was made from <i>sha'atnez</i>. Therefore, the priests were allowed to wear it only when they were actually involved in the Temple service. Wearing it at other times constitutes a transgression, and not a mitzvah.</p>
<p>Significantly, Rabbenu Tam differs with the Rambam and allows the sash and tzitzit to be worn even during the times when doing so does not fulfill a mitzvah."
Fringes 3.7,[The mitzvah applies only] during a time when one can see. -," i.e., the daytime hours.

Therefore, one might think that it is forbidden to wear a garment with tzitzit at night, for it would be considered as if one is carrying them.

Fringes 3.8,When should the blessing over tzitzit be recited in the morning? -," According to the Rambam, this question applies whether one wears his <i>tallit</i> at night or not. Nevertheless, because of Rabbenu Asher's opinion mentioned in the previous halachah, if someone slept in his <i>tallit katan</i>, he should not recite a blessing upon it in the morning. Instead, it is preferable that he recite the blessing over his <i>tallit gadol</i> with the intention of including the <i>tallit katan</i> (<i>Mishneh Berurah</i> 8:24)."
Fringes 3.8,"Which blessing should be recited upon it? ""Blessed are you, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to wrap ourselves with tzitzit."" -"," This is the blessing recited over the <i>tallit gadol</i>.

Fringes 3.9,"It is, however, a Rabbinical obligation for every child -","<i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (Vol. 17) notes that the Rambam's choice of phraseology appears to indicate that the requirement to become trained in the performance of mitzvot obligates the child himself. Generally, it is understood that the obligation is on the child's parents, who are required to train him in Torah observance.</p>
<p>The contention that the obligation is on the child himself is supported by <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who has eaten only a small meal can fulfill his obligation to recite the grace by answering ""Amen"" to the blessings recited by a child who has reached the age of education. This ruling is based on the rationale that both the child and the adult share the same degree of obligation, a Rabbinical decree.

Fringes 3.9,"without reciting a blessing. Similarly, regarding the other positive commandments which women are not required to fulfill, if they desire to fulfill them without reciting a blessing, they should not be prevented from doing so. -"," Since they are not obligated to fulfill these commandments, it is improper for them to say the blessing which praises God ""who has commanded us"" to perform the mitzvot.</p>
<p>This perspective is not accepted by Ashkenazic authorities.

Fringes 3.10,It is not that a garment requires [tzitzit]. -," The Rambam's statements in this halachah revolve around a difference of opinion of our Sages, <i>Menachot</i> 42b. There are Sages who maintain that tzitzit is an obligation that depends on the garment - i.e., the mitzvah is completed by placing tzitzit on every garment which requires them. The other opinion states that tzitzit are an obligation incumbent on a person, that a person is required to attach tzitzit to his garments. The Rambam rephrases the latter opinion as follows:"

<p>For this reason, a court must know the types of worship [practiced by gentiles] - Note Chapter 2, Halachah 2, which forbids the study of idolatrous practices.

<p>The Ra'avad holds one liable even for the slaughter of such an animal or of a locust, explaining that although the Rambam's decision reflects certain opinions mentioned in the Talmud, the final decision is that one is held liable. He explains that such forms of slaughter are much closer to the concept of the slaughter for sacrifice than the offering of feces or urine are to the service of libation."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.4,[before it]: -," This interpretation is also followed by the<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 139:3."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.4,one is liable [for the worship of false gods] -," To justify the seeming difficulty in the Rambam's decisions mentioned by the Ra'avad (see above), the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that since staffs figure in the worship of this deity, an act that resembles slaughter that is performed with a staff is significant. In contrast, animals lacking limbs and locusts are never used in the service of such deities; hence, their slaughter is of no consequence.</p>
<p>[Note, however, the Ramah, who explains that one is liable only when the deity is worshiped by breaking the stick.]"
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.4,If one threw a staff before it -, since this activity resembles pouring a libation before an idol
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.4,is not forbidden -," This decision makes the Rambam's line of reasoning difficult to follow. If throwing the staff is not comparable to sprinkling blood, why is one held liable for it? Accordingly, some commentaries have explained that this decision applies only when the deity is worshiped by throwing staffs. The <i>Pri Chadash</i>, however, differentiates between the liability of the worshiper (for which a sprinkling that spatters is not required) and the prohibition of the worship of the deity (for which it is)."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.4,while the blood spatters [in different directions]. -," Since the reason that these services are considered significant even though the deity is not normally worshiped in this manner is that these services were performed in the Temple, the analogy must be complete.

<p>A person who accepts any one of the various false gods - which already exist"
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.4,is liable for [execution by] stoning. -," The Rambam mentions that one is liable for stoning specifically. Generally, the term ""liable"" means ""liable to bring a sacrifice."" In this instance, however, a person who makes such a statement inadvertently is not obligated to bring a sacrifice. A sacrifice is only brought when one performs a deed in violation of the Torah's command (<i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:2)."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.4,lifted up a brick -, The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that this expression is merely a figure of speech. There is no need to perform a deed - lifting up the brick - for one to be held liable.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.6,"[The following rules apply when] a person serves a false deity out of love - i.e., he desires an image because its service is very attractive -"," The commentaries note that the Rambam interprets ""out of love"" differently from ""out of fear."" ""Out of love"" refers to a love for the image and its service, while ""out of fear"" means fear of what the deity can do to the person.</p>
<p>Rav Kapach explains the Rambam's position, justifying the need for such a difference in interpretation. Most idolaters do not worship their images out of a genuine conviction that they are the true god, but rather for the benefit they feel this service will bring them. Therefore, were a person to serve an idol with this intent in mind, the Rambam would hold him liable. In contrast, were he to serve out of fear, he is not considered to be acting on his own volition, and hence is not held responsible."

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.6,"One who embraces a false deity, kisses it, sweeps before it, mops before it, washes it, anoints it, dresses it, places shoes upon it, or performs any similar act of deference violates a negative commandment, as [implied by <a href=""/9881#v5"">Exodus 20:5</a>]: ""Do not serve them."" -", This commandment is described in Halachot 2 and 3.
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.6,"punished by lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah]. -"," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that punishment is not given because this prohibition is a לאו שבכללות - i.e., it includes many different forbidden acts. Lashes are not given for the violation of such a prohibition, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3.</p>
<p>To explain: The prohibition, ""Do not serve them,"" is twofold in nature. It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.</p>
<p>Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes. Since, in essence, this prohibition is not associated with lashes, even the many transgressions of a lesser nature which are also included within this prohibition are also not punishable in this manner (Rav Kapach)."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.6,was the accepted mode of worship [of a particular deity] and a person performed this service as an act of worship -," and not merely as an expression of emotion. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the addition of the words ""as an act of worship,"" noting that in Halachah 5, the Rambam holds one liable for performing the service with which Pe'or or Marculis was worshiped, even though one's intent was to repudiate the idols. Thus, it appears that once a person performs a service which is the accepted mode of worship, his intent is no longer significant.</p>
<p>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> resolves this difficulty, explaining that the extent of liability is different. In the previous halachah, the offender was liable for a sin offering alone, while here,"
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.7,"If a splinter becomes stuck in a person's foot before an idol, he should not bend down to remove it, because it appears that he is bowing down to the idol. -"," <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 12a states that if the person turns his back or side to the idol, his bowing would not be considered to be an act of deference, and no prohibition is involved."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.7,"If money belonging to a person becomes scattered before an idol, he should not bow down and pick it up, because it appears that he is bowing down to the idol. -"," From the commentaries' discussion of this law, it appears that if the person does bow down, he is not held liable for his actions. <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> questions the difference between this decision and Halachah 5, which holds a person who throws a stone to Marculis with the intent to repudiate it liable for a sin offering. He resolves that difficulty, explaining that in Halachah 5, the person intended to throw the stone at the idol. Since that act constitutes worship of this deity, he is held liable. In contrast, in our halachah the person did not bow down to the idol at all. The only reason the bowing is prohibited is that a mistaken impression might be created."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.9,"A person who has a false god made for himself - even though he, himself, did not actually fashion it -"," i.e., he commissioned another person to make the idol for him."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.9,is [liable for] lashes -," The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions this statement, noting that lashes are not given for a transgression which does not involve a deed, and that speech is not ordinarily considered to be a deed. He explains that since the craftsman fashions the idol on behalf of the person who commissioned him, he is considered to be the latter's agent. Therefore, the one who commissioned him is held responsible for his deed.</p>
<p>The commentaries question this explanation, noting that - with the exception of a few specific instances - the Torah never holds a person who commissions another individual to commit a sin liable, since the person who actually committed the sin is responsible for his actions. Also, the Rambam's phraseology here implies that one is held liable regardless whether the craftsman is a Jew or gentile, and a gentile is never given the halachic status of an agent.</p>
<p>The following are among the resolutions offered to this difficulty:<br/>
a) A hired worker's actions - whether positive or negative - are always attributed to his employer (<i>Machaneh Efrayim, Hilchot Shutafim</i> 8).<br/>
b) The verse prohibiting this act reveals that this is one of the few exceptions to the general rule mentioned above, and in this case, the person who commissioned the agent is held liable (<i>Darchei HaMelech</i>).<br/>
c) Commenting on <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 13:2, the <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> explains that if it is possible to violate a particular prohibition by committing a deed, one is punished by lashes even when one violates it without committing a deed. The same concept can be applied here (<i>S'deh Chemed</i>).<br/>
d) The deed for which one is punished is not the command to make the idol, but rather its purchase or acquisition (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>, Alfandari)."

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.10,"This refers even to images of gold and silver which are intended only for decorative purposes, lest others err and view them as deities. -"," The Rambam's statement sheds light on an interesting Rabbinic debate. The Sages of the Talmud often established ""fences around the Torah"" - i.e., safeguards to prevent the violation of Torah law. (See <i>Avot</i> 1:1.) There is a question whether the Torah itself instituted prohibitions for such a purpose - i.e., are there mitzvot that are instituted without a self-contained goal of their own, but merely to prevent the violation of other prohibitions? (See <i>Lekach Tov</i> 8.)</p>
<p>From the Rambam's statements here (see also <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 7:8), it appears that he accepts such a premise. It appears that there is nothing intrinsically wrong in making statues per se. Nevertheless, since if such statues are made, the possibility exists that they may be worshiped, the Torah forbids us to make them."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.10,"Therefore, it is forbidden to make human images with wood, cement, or stone -", or any other material. The Rambam mentioned these materials because they were commonly used in his time.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.5,Synagogues and houses of study should be treated with respect. -," The <i>Mishneh Berurah</i> (151:1) notes that <i>Megillah</i> 29a quotes <a href=""/16109#v16"">Ezekiel 11:16</a>: ""I have been a sanctuary in microcosm to them in the countries where they have come"" to describe the synagogues in the Diaspora. This association allows one to infer that the obligation to honor a synagogue is related to the mitzvah (<i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, Positive Commandment 21) to revere the Temple.</p>
<p>The <i>S'dei Chemed</i> cites <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 65) which mentions the prohibition against ""destroying the houses where God is worshiped,"" indicating that the obligation to honor the synagogues has its source in a Torah commandment.

Rashi also includes in the category of קלות ראש all the other activities the Rambam mentions in this halachah because they all cause us to view the synagogue as a place where mundane affairs can be carried out, and thus, minimize our appreciation of its holiness."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.6,We may not eat or drink inside [a synagogue] -," <i>Pesachim</i> 101a relates that wayfarers would eat meals in the synagogue.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.9,"A person who has to enter a synagogue to call a child or his friend, should enter and read [a portion of the written law] or relate a teaching [of the oral law] and then call his friend -"," The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that the person should study first and then call his friend, so that it will not appear that he entered the synagogue only to serve his personal concerns."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.9,"If he does not know [how to study], he should ask one of the children -"," This suggestion is quoted from <i>Megillah</i> 28b, the source for this halachah.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.9,"or, [at the very least,] wait a while in the synagogue -", The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 151:8) states that one must wait at least the length of time it takes to walk eight handbreadths (slightly less than five feet).

If this will be permitted in the Temple, it is surely permitted in a synagogue.<br/>",
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.10,A person is permitted to enter a synagogue -," The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 9:6) forbids the following four activities on the Temple Mount, considering them as irreverent. See also <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:2."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.11,holy. -," Therefore,"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.11,so must they be treated [with respect] when they are destroyed -," <i>Megillah</i> 28b mentions that if one constructed a synagogue with the condition that it can be used for mundane purposes, one may do so. As mentioned in the commentary to Halachah 6, the Ramban and other authorities maintain that if a synagogue was constructed with such a condition, guests may eat inside and it may be used for other mundane purposes.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> disagrees, maintaining that the condition has no effect while the synagogue is standing and applies only after it has been destroyed. Thus, were a synagogue to be built with such a condition, as were the synagogues in Babylonia in Talmudic times, mundane activities could be carried on within its premises after it was destroyed. However, even then, activities directly opposed to the sanctity of the synagogue, e.g., sowing crops on the land, are forbidden.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 151:11) quotes <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion. Interestingly, the Rambam does not mention either the Ramban's or <i>Tosafot's</i> interpretation of the possibility of making the condition mentioned in <i>Megillah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.11,"If grass grows in them, it should be pulled out and left there -"," The Mishnah (<i>Megillah</i> 28b) states, ""If grass grow in it, it should not be pulled out."" The Talmud comments that one is not allowed to pull out the grass to use as fodder for animals, but one may pull out the grass and leave it there.</p>
<p>In his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam writes that one is permitted to pull the grass out and leave it in its place. The published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (which we have quoted) appears to imply that one should pull them out (i.e., it is imperative to do so). However, the version of the halachah found in authoritative manuscripts is closer to the understanding in the Commentary to the Mishnah.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:10) quotes the version of the halachah in the published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. However, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (151:29) quotes the Commentary to the Mishnah."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.12,One should not tear down a synagogue in order to build another in its place or in another place. -," Note <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 65), which states that destroying a synagogue is a transgression of a Torah commandment. Nonetheless, if one's intention is to build a new synagogue, the destruction of the old one is permitted (See also Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 152:2)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.12,lest unforeseen difficulties arise [which prevent it] from being built. -," The second reason mentioned in the Talmud is so that people will have a place to pray in the interim. The Talmud notes that different corollaries result from these two explanations. If there is another synagogue in the city, according to the second explanation (not mentioned by the Rambam), one could tear down the first synagogue while building a new one, since people would be able to pray in the other synagogue in the interim. However, according to the explanation quoted by the Rambam, it would be improper to destroy the synagogue lest the new synagogue never be built.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 152:1) quotes the Rambam's decision. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 152:4 states that this law applies even if all the money necessary to build the new synagogue has been collected."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.13,When does the above apply? When its foundations are not ruined or its walls are not leaning perilously -, so that there is no danger in continuing to pray within.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.13,it should be destroyed immediately -, The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> (152) states that this applies even if the community does not have another place to pray.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.14,It is permitted to transform a synagogue into a house of study. -," <i>Megillah</i> 27a describes a house of study as ""a great house,"" ""a house where Torah is developed."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.14,"and one must proceed to a higher rung of holiness, -"," Our translation is based on the opinion of Rabbenu Nissim who maintains that it is forbidden to exchange a sacred article for another of an equal level of holiness. There are other opinions who maintain that it is permitted to do so. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 153:11 states that even according to those opinions, the permission to do so is after the fact (בדיעבד), but not a priori."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.14,"Similarly, the inhabitants of a city -", <i>Megillah</i> 26b explains that this only applies to a synagogue in a village as explained in Halachah 16.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.14,may purchase an ark -, See Halachah 3.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.14,"If they sold an ark, they may purchase a mantle -"," In Ashkenazic communities, it is customary to hold a Torah scroll in a mantle."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.14,"for a Torah scroll with the proceeds. If they sold a mantle or a case, they may buy chumashim -"," In Talmudic times, the expression <i>chumash</i> referred to a scroll on which only one of the five books of Moses was written. Since it contained only one book, its holiness was on a lower level than that of a complete Torah scroll."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.14,for there is no level of holiness above that of a Torah scroll. -," In <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam writes, ""A kosher Torah scroll should be treated with special holiness and great honor."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.15,"Similar [principles apply] if a congregation collected money to build a house of study or a synagogue or to purchase an ark, a mantle or a case [for a Torah scroll], or a Torah scroll, and desired to change [the purpose for which] all the [funds] had been [originally] collected. -", Just as it is forbidden to sell sacred articles in order to purchase articles of lesser sanctity...
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.15,except from a matter of lesser sanctity to one of greater sanctity. -," Rav Moshe Cohen questions the Rambam's decision, asking why it is forbidden to make a change of this nature. Even bricks intended for use in constructing a synagogue can be used for other purposes as long as they have not been actually built into the synagogue (See <i>Megillah</i> 26b).</p>
<p>The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:2) explains that money collected for the purchase of religious articles does not possess the sanctity of those articles. However, since the donors intended that the money be used to purchase religious articles, its use is constrained by the terms of an implicit vow that it be used for this purpose. Despite this limitation, the congregation may use these funds for another purpose associated with a mitzvah and substitute other funds to accomplish the purpose for which these funds were originally collected. (Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 153:5, who does not accept the latter conclusion.)</p>
<p>The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> (153) supports the <i>Turei Zahav's</i> position based on <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:20, which states that a sacred utensil made with the intent that it be used in the Temple is not considered as ""sacred"" until it has actually been used for its intended purpose."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.15,"they may use the remainder for whatever they desire. -<i>Megillah</i> 27a mentions this leniency based on the principle that the money itself does not have the sanctity of the religious articles for whose purchase it was donated, but is merely designated to be used for their purchase.<br/>",

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.15,like the synagogue itself -," and can only be sold for similar purposes.</p>
<p>Our Sages placed certain restrictions on the sale of the components of a synagogue. In <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 8:6, the Rambam writes:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">If someone donates a light or a candle to a synagogue, it is forbidden to exchange it [for something else]. If [the sale] concerns a matter which is a mitzvah, it may be exchanged.... If the name of the donor has been forgotten, it is permitted to exchange [the object] even for a mundane matter.</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> 10:4, the Rambam states that the platform ""has no sanctity at all."" However, this statement should be interpreted to mean that the platform is not considered a ""sacred article"" like the others mentioned in that halachah."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.15,is considered like the mantle of a Torah scroll -," since from time to time, it is placed under the Torah scroll (<i>Megillah</i> 26b)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.15,"was made concerning them, -", when they were originally purchased
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.16,"When do the above statements permitting the sale of a synagogue apply? In regard to a synagogue in a village. Since it was constructed for the sake of the inhabitants of that village alone, -"," even if the money for its construction was donated by people from outside the city (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:7)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.16,they are permitted to sell it if they all desire to do so. -, The Ramban states that the consent of the majority of the village's inhabitants is sufficient. His opinion is accepted as halachah by the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 153:24.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.17,The inhabitants of a village -, See the previous Halachah.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.17,"must establish as a condition [of the sale] that the purchaser not use the building for a bathhouse, a leatherworks, a mikveh, or a laundry. -"," The translation of the Hebrew, בית המים, is based on Rashi's commentary to <i>Megillah</i> 27b. He also offers an alternate translation, ""a latrine."" The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> favors the translation ""laundry"" since the prohibition against using the synagogue as a latrine is self-evident. Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:9), Rav Yosef Karo mentions a latrine, but not a laundry.</p>
<p>The sanctity of the synagogue is transferred to the money received from its sale and the building itself is no longer considered as ""holy."" Nonetheless, using the premises for such purposes is considered degrading.</p>
<p>As support for the prohibition against using premises that had previously served as a synagogue for such purposes, the <i>Or Sameach</i> cites <a href=""/16557#v11"">II Chronicles 8:11</a>: ""I will not have a woman dwelling in the house of David... for the [places] where the ark of God has come are holy."" Although the ark had already been placed in the Temple, it was not becoming to the ark for Pharaoh's daughter to be allowed to live in a place where it had been kept."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.17,made a condition in the presence of the entire community -, The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:7) states that a public announcement of the sale is sufficient for it to be considered as if all the inhabitants of the city were present.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.18,"the remainder of the funds could be used for mundane purposes, they may be used for such purposes. -"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:7) accepts the opinion of Rashi, the Ra'avad, and Rabbenu Asher, who differ with the Rambam and maintain that the entire proceeds from the sale of a synagogue can be used for mundane purposes if the sale was carried out in the above manner.</p>
<p>In his <i>Kessef Mishnah</i>, Rav Yosef Karo explains the difference between these positions as follows. These authorities do not accept the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Megillah</i> 26a-b mentioned in the previous Halachah, and maintain that a certain measure of sanctity always remains in the synagogue. The Rambam maintains that the sanctity is transferred to the money received for the synagogue. Therefore, the condition made by the city officials can never effect the entire sum of money. Rather, the major portion must always be used for a sacred object.</p>
<p>[Interestingly, in his <i>Kessef Mishnah</i>, Rav Yosef Karo points out the advantages of the Rambam's position. However, in his<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, he accepts the decisions of the other authorities.]"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.19,"or a majority of them - accept [the authority of] a single individual, -", Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 153:35 which states that this applies only when the inhabitants of the city donated the money for the synagogue's construction themselves and accepted the authority of the person involved from the beginning of the synagogue's construction.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.20,"If the community had not received any benefit from giving it as a gift, it would not have given it. -"," This principle is also reflected in questions of business law, e.g., <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 9:9.</p>
<p>The Ritbah states that even when the community has not yet received any benefit from a person, it may give him a synagogue in the expectation of receiving such benefit."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.20,"it is permitted to sell the bricks, timber, and soil, exchange them, -", even if the articles given in return are received later (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 153:68)
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.20,"However, it is forbidden to lend them, -"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:11) states that this prohibition applies even when the loan is made by the community officials in the presence of the community.</p>
<p>Though the community officials have the power to nullify the sanctity of a synagogue as mentioned in Halachot 17 and 18, that provision only applies when they do so completely. In this instance, since the building materials have to be returned, their sanctity is not nullified. Hence, no one has the right to lend them to anyone for mundane use."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.21,Although the people pray in a city's main street on fast days -," <i>Hilchot Ta'anit</i> 4:1 states:</p>

<p>and ma'amadot, - The mention of <i>ma'amadot</i> in this context in <i>Megillah</i> 26a (the source for this halachah), and here, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has raised questions. In <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 6:1-2, the Rambam describes the <i>ma'amadot</i> as follows:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">The early prophets ordained that honest people who fear sin should be chosen to stand over the sacrifices. They are called <i>anshei ma'amad</i>. They were divided into 24 different watches....<br/>
Each week, the <i>anshei ma'amad</i> of that watch would gather together. Those who lived in Jerusalem or close to it would come to the Temple.... Those who lived far away... would gather together in the synagogues of their locale.</p>
<p>In no source other than <i>Megillah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) is it mentioned that the <i>anshei ma'amad</i> would pray in the street."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,Anyone who intentionally eats an olive's size --," Whenever the Torah uses the verb אכל (eat) in the context of a mitzvah or a prohibition, it refers to the consumption of at least a minimum amount, established by <i>Eruvin</i> 4b as the size of an olive.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that the measure of a כזית (an olive's size) cannot be determined by measuring an average olive today. Rather, it is dependent on the measure established by the Sages and this is the subject of debate by the Rabbinic authorities. The <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) explains that the Rambam considers an olive as one third the size of an egg (כביצה, a more familiar Talmudic measure). In terms of modern measurements, this olive size would be between 16.6 and 24 grams, according to various Halachic opinions.</p>
<p><i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Chullin</i> 103a) differs, and defines a כזית(the size of an olive) as one half the size of an egg (between 25.6 and 36 grams according to the various opinions). With regard to the practical application of the law (<i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) advises that in all questions of Torah law, <i>Tosefot's</i> opinion should be followed. However, in questions of Rabbinic law, the more lenient opinion can be relied upon."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,of chametz --," any mixture made from grain or grain products that has come into contact with water and was allowed to become leavened. The following (and only the following) five species are referred to as grain: wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,[Should one eat this amount of chametz] unintentionally --," בשוגג,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,[as atonement] --, <i>Keritot</i> 2a states that a person who unintentionally commits a transgression for which one would be liable for כרת must bring a sin offering in atonement.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.2,On Pesach --," As stated in Halachah 9, once chametz becomes forbidden on noon of the fourteenth of Nisan, we may not derive any benefit from it."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.2,"as [<a href=""/9874#v3"">Exodus 13:3</a>] states: ""Do not eat (","</p>

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.2,"A person who leaves chametz within his property on Pesach, even though he does not eat it, transgresses two prohibitions: [<a href=""/9874#v7"">Exodus 13:7</a>] states: ""No leavening agent may be seen in all your territory"" --"," This prohibition is counted as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah: <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, negative commandment 200; <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, mitzvah 20."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.3,[A violator] is not lashed --, this is the punishment given for the active violation of any of the Torah's prohibitions that are not punishable by death.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.3,"or [caused flour] to become leavened, and thus committed a deed. --"," The <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> raises a significant question: A person is not liable for lashes for violating any prohibition which he can correct by fulfilling a positive commandment (לעשה לאו הניתק): For example, if a person violates the prohibition against taking both a mother bird and her eggs, he can free himself from the punishment of lashes by sending away the mother bird.</p>
<p><i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 29b) states that the prohibition against chametz being seen in one's property falls into the above category, because one can correct the violation of this prohibition by fulfilling the positive commandment to destroy chametz. Thus, it appears that a person can never be held liable for lashes for this transgression.</p>
<p>Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that of Rav Chayim Soloveitchik, who explains that <i>Tosefot's</i> statements apply only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who maintains that chametz must be destroyed by burning. However, according to the Sages (whose opinion is accepted by the Rambam, Halachah 3:11), who maintain that chametz can be destroyed by any means, not necessarily burning, the prohibition against possessing chametz is not considered a לאו הניתק לעשה.</p>
<p>What is the essential difference between these opinions: Rabbi Yehudah maintains that the fundamental aspect of the mitzvah to destroy chametz revolves upon the article itself (חפצה); it is a mitzvah to destroy chametz. In contrast, the Sages maintain that the mitzvah centers on the person (גברה); he is commanded to remove all chametz from his possession.</p>
<p>According to Rabbi Yehudah, since the commandment revolves around the chametz itself, its destruction directly ""corrects"" the sin of its possession. In contrast, according to the Sages, the positive commandment of ridding one's house of chametz is merely a reinforcement of the prohibition against its possession, and the fulfillment of the positive commandment does not have the power to ""correct"" the violation of the prohibition."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.3,"even though he transgresses two prohibitions, according to the Torah, he is not lashed, for he did not perform a deed. --"," <i>Sh'vuot</i> 21b states: ""The transgression of any prohibition which does not involve a deed is not punishable by lashing."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.4,It is prohibited to ever benefit from chametz --," itself, in contrast to mixtures of chametz, as explained in Halachah 5."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.4,possessed during Pesach --," This prohibition applies to all Jews, not only to the owner of the chametz (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Pesachim</i> 28). Thus, it is prohibited to buy chametz from a store owned by a Jew who did not observe the prohibition against possessing chametz on Pesach."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.4,"Since the person transgressed the [prohibitions against chametz] being found and being seen [in his possession], they prohibited its use --", The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the prohibition against using a Jew's chametz after Pesach applies even when the prohibitions against possessing chametz are not violated. See Halachah 4:5.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.4,or was forced to do so --," The <i>Nodah BiYhudah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 20) gives an example of such a case. A thief stole chametz from a person before Pesach and returned it to him after the holiday. Even though the person had no opportunity to destroy it before Pesach, it is forbidden.</p>
<p>In that responsum, the <i>Nodah BiYhudah</i> also raises the following question: A person died on the fourteenth of Nisan without nullifying or selling his chametz. Are his heirs forbidden to benefit from that chametz or not? He maintains that although the Rambam would probably prohibit benefiting from this chametz, there are rationales on the basis of which its use may be permitted. [Other authorities (note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Kuntres Acharon</i> 435) do not accept this conclusion.]"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.5,"If, on Pesach, --"," Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> maintain that this principle does not apply until the holiday itself actually begins. Thus, even if chametz became mixed with other substances on the fourteenth of Nisan, after the time chametz is forbidden, the mixture is bound by the laws regarding the nullification of forbidden objects (ביטול איסורים) that apply throughout the entire year.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that a simple interpretation of the Rambam's statements leads to the conclusion that he accepts this opinion. Though others, among them the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, do not accept this view, it is accepted as Halachah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 447:2)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.5,either of its kind --," When the prohibited substance is of the same kind as the forbidden substance (e.g., improperly slaughtered meat mixed with properly slaughtered meat), all that is required to nullify the prohibition is that the permitted substance constitutes the majority of the mixture (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:1)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.5,[the entire mixture] is forbidden --," The above principles do not apply with regard to chametz on Pesach. Even the slightest mixture of chametz may not be eaten, nor may benefit be derived from it. In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> (15:9), the Rambam explains that this stringency is instituted because chametz is a דבר שיש לו מתירין (a substance which later will become permitted).</p>
<p>A דבר שיש לו מתירין which becomes mixed together with a permitted substance of its own kind is never permitted to be used because of the following rationale: Since its use in its entirety will later become permitted, there is no need to grant a leniency allowing it to be eaten when forbidden.</p>
<p>Similarly, with regard to chametz on Pesach: There is no prohibition against using a mixture of chametz after Pesach. Hence, there is no need to grant permission to eat such a mixture on Pesach itself, even though the quantity of the permitted substance far surpasses that of the chametz.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a stricter dimension to chametz than to any other דבר שיש לו מתירין. Generally, a דבר שיש לו מתירין is permitted if it becomes mixed with a substance of another kind to the extent that its taste can no longer be discerned. However, this leniency is not granted regarding mixtures of chametz. Since <a href=""/9873#v20"">Exodus 12:20</a> states: ""You must not eat any leaven,"" the severity of the prohibition obligates additional stringency."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.5,or not of its kind --," for example, a mixture of flour with any other substance."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.6,One is only liable for, כרת — as stated in Halachah 1
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.6,Median beer --," beer made of fermented barley, as our beer. Generally, the beer referred to in the Talmud was made from fermented dates (Rashi, <i>Pesachim</i> 42b)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.6,[is punished by] lashes and is not liable for,"</p>
<p>כרת <b>[for this involves the transgression of a different commandment] — different from eating chametz itself</b>"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.6,When does the above apply? When the person consumed an olive size --," the minimum size of a prohibited substance for which one is liable for punishment, as explained in Halachah 1."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.6,"Then, he is obligated for lashes by the Torah --", as explained above.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.7,Eating even the slightest amount of chametz itself --, The laws regarding mixtures of chametz were mentioned in the previous halachah.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.7,"as [<a href=""/9874#v3"">Exodus 13:3</a>] states: ""Do not eat [leaven]"" --"," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions why the Rambam cites this verse. <i>Yoma</i> (ibid.) derives the prohibition against eating less than an olive size of prohibited substances from another source.</p>
<p>The Radbaz (Responsa, Vol. V, 143) explains that the prohibition against חצי שיעור exists only when eating the prohibited substance itself. In contrast, חצי שיעור of chametz is forbidden even when mixed with other substances, as explained in the previous halachah. He explains that since deriving benefit from chametz is forbidden according to Torah law, that prohibition also includes eating חצי שיעור in any form."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.7,A person who intentionally violates the prohibition and eats less than an olive size of chametz --," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions why the Rambam begins the halachah by describing the prohibition against ""even the slightest amount"" of chametz, and concludes with the expression ""less than the size of an olive."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.8,It is forbidden to eat chametz on the day of the fourteenth [of Nisan] from noon onwards --," The <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 199) and the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 485) count this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. The Ramban and the Ra'avad take issue with this point, explaining that from noon on the fourteenth of Nisan until the beginning of the fifteenth at nightfall, there is a positive commandment to rid one's house of chametz, but no negative command forbidding the possession or eating of chametz."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.8,Any person who eats chametz --, The Rambam explicitly states that lashes are never given for violating prohibitions against benefiting from forbidden articles (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 8:16). The <i>Mishneh Lamelech</i> (<i>Hilchot Yesodai HaTorah</i> 5:8) elaborates on this principle in detail.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.8,"as [<a href=""/9980#v3"">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>] states: ""Do not eat any leaven with it""; i.e., together with the Paschal sacrifice. Based on the oral tradition --", <i>Pesachim</i> 5a
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.9,The Sages forbade the eating of chametz from the beginning of the sixth hour in order to prevent infringement upon a Torah commandment --," This is one of the Rabbinic commandments instituted as a ""fence"" and safeguard to Torah law."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.9,"it is forbidden to eat or benefit from chametz based on Rabbinic law. During the rest of the day, from the seventh hour on, eating chametz is forbidden because of the Torah law --", as stated in the previous halachah.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.9,we do not eat chametz lest it be a cloudy day and we err between the fifth and six hours --," In his commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 1:4), the Rambam explains that it is possible that a person may err in his estimation of the time by an hour and thus, transgress the Rabbinic prohibition against possessing chametz at the sixth hour.</p>
<p>In a Responsa, the Rambam replies to the following question: The passage in <i>Pesachim</i> which is the source for this halachah appears to imply that a person may make an error of over two hours. Indeed, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi states the matter as such in his <i>halachot</i>. If so, why did the Rambam alter the explanation of the law.</p>
<p>In a reply which reflects his overall purpose in the composition of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam answers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mentioned a mistake of an hour which is a common error because my intention in composing this text is to bring the matters closer to our understanding or what is general practice."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.9,"Therefore, Terumah --", a portion of grain given to the priests
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.9,which are chametz are left in a tentative status because of their holiness. --," The Torah refers to <i>Terumah</i> as קדש (sanctified). Similarly, the breads of the thanksgiving offering have a sacrificial status. Therefore,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.9,nor burned --," for it is forbidden to destroy sacred articles unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, <i>Pesachim</i> 13b explains that thanksgiving offerings were not brought on the fourteenth of Nisan. [This law is also relevant at present. From the fourteenth of Nisan until the conclusion of Pesach, the ""Psalm of Thanksgiving"" is omitted from the morning service.]"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.10,"Thus, you have learned that it is permitted to eat chametz on the day of the fourteenth [of Nisan] until the end of the fourth hour --", as explained in the previous halachah.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.10,"A person who eats chametz during the sixth hour is [punished by] ""stripes for being rebellious."" --"," The punishment given for transgressing a Rabbinic commandment. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> notes that the Rambam does not prescribe a punishment for a person who breaks the Rabbinic decree against eating chametz during the fifth hour.</p>
<p>The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> (Responsum 83) also differentiates between the fifth and sixth hours, calling the former, a Rabbinic safeguard, and the latter, a Rabbinic prohibition."
Circumcision 1.1,Circumcision is a positive mitzvah -, <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 215) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 2) consider this one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
Circumcision 1.1,karet -," Premature death at the hand of God (<i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 28a) and a severe spiritual punishment, the ""soul's being cut off,"" and not being granted a share in the world to come (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1,5)."
Circumcision 1.1,A father -, and not a mother (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a)
Circumcision 1.1,"and a master, his slaves. -"," Here, the responsibility for the mitzvah is surely the master's. This circumcision is one of the stages in the process by which the slave attains the status of <i>eved C'na'ani</i>, an intermediate rung between a gentile and a Jew. He is obligated to fulfill all the negative commandments and all those positive commandments that are not associated with a specific time. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 12:11.)"
Circumcision 1.1,and to those purchased by him. -," See <a href=""/8212#v27"">Genesis 17:27</a>, which relates that Abraham circumcised both these categories of servants."
Circumcision 1.1,"He is not, however, punished by karet, for karet is incurred only by the uncircumcised person himself. -", This is obvious from the proof-text quoted above.
Circumcision 1.2,We may not circumcise a person's son without his knowledge -," See <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 7:13-14, where the Rambam describes the prohibition against ""stealing"" the performance of a mitzvah from a colleague, and the fine of ten gold pieces for doing so. The Ramah (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 382:1) explicitly associates this concept with circumcising a person's son without his knowledge."
Circumcision 1.2,"[In such an instance,] the court must circumcise -", the obligation mentioned in the previous halachah falls upon them
Circumcision 1.2,"If the matter does not become known to the court and they do not circumcise him, when [the child] reaches <i>bar mitzvah</i> he is obligated to circumcise himself. -"," <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there are three aspects to the mitzvah of circumcision:</p>
<p>a) to remove the foreskin;<br/>
b) to be circumcised;<br/>
c) not to be uncircumcised. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)&lt; /p&gt;</p>
<p>The first aspect involves a single deed. The second and third dimensions, however, are ongoing qualities that a person continues to possess even after the deed of circumcision is completed. Thus, the <i>Or Zarua</i> quotes <i>Menachot</i> 43b, which relates that when King David entered the bathhouse, he was upset for he was ""naked,"" without mitzvot. When he remembered that he was circumcised, he relaxed, realizing that he was still involved with the performance of a mitzvah.</p>
<p>This indicates that, even years after his circumcision, he was considered to be fulfilling the mitzvah. In contrast, with regard to the mitzvot of tefillin and tzitzit, although he had just removed them, he was no longer considered to be involved in the performance of these mitzvot."
Circumcision 1.2,"He is not, however, liable for karet until he dies uncircumcised -"," As mentioned above, there are two dimensions to the punishment of <i>karet</i>: premature death and the cutting off of the soul. According to the Rambam, a person who does not circumcise himself is liable only for the second aspect of this punishment, since until he dies, it is not known whether he will perform the mitzvah or not (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</p>
<p>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statements, stating that each day he does not perform the mitzvah, he is liable for <i>karet</i> and is worthy of premature death. (Even according to the Ra'avad, were the person to circumcise himself, he would no longer be liable for <i>karet</i>)."
Circumcision 1.3,A master is obligated to circumcise both a slave who was born as the property of a Jewish owner -," i.e., the ""home-born slave"" mentioned in <a href=""/8212#v12"">Genesis 17:12</a>"
Circumcision 1.3,"[There is, however, a difference between the two.] A home- born slave should be circumcised on the eighth day [of his life] -"," as is a Jewish child. The above verse states that ""all those born in your house"" - i.e., also slaves - should be circumcised on the eighth day (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 135b)."
Circumcision 1.4,"There are, however -", certain exceptions to the rules mentioned in the previous halachah that are also mentioned in <i>Shabbat</i> 135b. There are some
Circumcision 1.4,and -, some
Circumcision 1.4,What is implied? Should one purchase a maidservant and purchase [the rights to] her fetus [separately] -, This is possible when the maidservant herself belonged to one master and the fetus to another (Rambam in his responsa).
Circumcision 1.5,If a person purchased a maidservant for her offspring -," In his responsum cited above, the Rambam compares this to a person who buys a tree for its fruit - i.e., he is not the actual owner of the tree, but is entitled to all the fruit it produces. Similarly, in this instance, the master is not the owner of the maidservant; what he has purchased is the right to her offspring. Therefore, none of the offspring are considered ""home-born,"" and must be circumcised immediately."
Circumcision 1.5,"even though her offspring is born in his domain, the child should be circumcised on the day he was born. -"," The first instance mentioned does not require explanation. With regard to the second category, the Rambam elaborates:"
Circumcision 1.5,If his mother immersed herself after she gave birth -," This shows that the stipulation that she need not be immersed (see the following halachah) is nullified and considered of no consequence. Therefore, she is considered to be part of the household, and"
Circumcision 1.6,When a person purchases a slave from the gentiles and the slave does not consent -," Note the difference of opinion in <i>Yevamot</i> 48b, whether this leniency is granted if the slave refuses outright to be circumcised."
Circumcision 1.6,"It is forbidden to maintain him for any longer period while he remains uncircumcised, and one must sell him to gentiles. -"," He must, however, agree to accept the seven universal laws mentioned below. Otherwise, he should be slain (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Circumcision 1.6,"it is permissible to maintain him although he is not circumcised, provided he accepts the seven universal laws commanded to the descendants of Noah -"," The prohibitions against idol worship, cursing God, murder, theft, adultery, eating flesh taken from a living animal, and the obligation to establish a court system. (See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1-2.)"
Circumcision 1.6,If he refuses to accept these seven laws -, The slave must formally accept the performance of these mitzvot in the presence of a Rabbinic court.
Circumcision 1.6,A resident alien may be accepted only in the era when the laws of yovel -, The Jubilee year
Circumcision 1.7,"When a convert enters the congregation of Israel, he is obligated to undergo circumcision first. -"," <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:1-4 states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">With three acts, Israel entered into a covenant [with God]: circumcision, immersion [in the mikveh], and [the offering of] sacrifices.... Similarly, with regard to future generations, when a gentile wants to enter into the covenant, take refuge under the wings of the Divine Presence, and accept the yoke of the Torah, he must undergo circumcision, immersion, and the offering of a sacrifice.</p>
<p>The phrase ""accept the yoke of the Torah"" indicates that before performing these deeds, the prospective convert must resolve to fulfill the mitzvot."
Circumcision 1.7,it is necessary to extract the blood of the covenant -," a superficial cut is made on the shaft of the penis, and a small amount of blood extracted.</p>
<p>The expression ""blood of the covenant"" is derived from the interpretation of <a href=""/9885#v8"">Exodus 24:8</a>, ""This is the blood of the covenant which God established with you,"" in certain texts of <i>Nedarim</i> 31b and the <i>Mechilta's</i> interpretation of <a href=""/16213#v11"">Zechariah 9:11</a>, ""Because of the blood of your covenant, I have sent forth your prisoners from the pit."""
Circumcision 1.7,"Similarly, a child who was born without a foreskin -"," Our Sages mention this as a sign of a high spiritual level, citing Moses and Shem (Noah's son) as examples of children born without a foreskin."
Circumcision 1.7,on the eighth day. -," Note Chapter 3, Halachah 6, which states that a blessing is not recited for this activity.</p>
<p>The Ramah mentions several other instances when blood must be extracted: a child who was circumcised before the eighth day (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 262:1), circumcised at night ( loc. cit.), or circumcised by a gentile ( loc. cit., 264:1) should have blood extracted for the sake of fulfilling the mitzvah. (Note also the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)"
Circumcision 1.7,must be circumcised on the eighth day -," lest he be obligated to undergo circumcision.</p>
<p>See <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:3), who writes:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">There are those who say there is no such thing as an <i>androgynous</i>. Their statements are false.... I beheld such a phenomenon with my own eyes. Twelve years ago, I myself circumcised a child with this condition."
Circumcision 1.7,and a child who has two foreskins -," This refers to a birth abnormality. Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 135b) mentions two interpretations: a person with a single penis that is covered by two foreskins; alternatively, a person with two penises."
Circumcision 1.8,Circumcision is performed only during the day -," This applies to all circumcisions - those of children, servants, and converts"
Circumcision 1.8,"as [<a href=""/9913#v3"">Leviticus 12:3</a>] states, ""On the eighth day...,"" i.e., during the day -"," only,"
Circumcision 1.8,"[This applies to both a circumcision performed] at the appropriate time, the eighth day [after birth], and [to a circumcision performed] after the appropriate time, from the ninth day and onward.","</p>

Circumcision 1.9,When a circumcision [is performed] at its appropriate time -, on the eighth day.
Circumcision 1.9,on the Sabbath. -," <i>Shabbat</i> 132a relates that the verse, ""On the eighth day, the child's foreskin will be circumcised,"" is a Torah decree, requiring circumcision on the eighth day regardless of the day on which it falls."
Circumcision 1.9,Whether or not it is performed at its appropriate time -," Note Rav Kapach, who asks how is it possible for a sign of <i>tzara'at</i> to be already definitely determined as such by the eighth day of a child's life."
Circumcision 1.10,"Just as the circumcision of sons supersedes [the prohibitions against labor on] the Sabbath, so too, the circumcision of those slaves who are circumcised on the eighth day [of their lives] -"," The ""home-born"" slaves mentioned in Halachot 3-4. In contrast, slaves who were purchased, and therefore should be circumcised on the day they were purchased (or born), should not be circumcised on the Sabbath."
Circumcision 1.10,There is [one] exception - a slave whose mother did not immerse herself until after she gave birth. -, See Halachah 5 and commentary.
Circumcision 1.11,[The circumcision of the following individuals] does not supersede [the prohibitions against labor on] the Sabbath: a child who was born without a foreskin; -," Since, as stated in Halachah 7, the blood is extracted from him only because of a suspicion that he has a hidden foreskin, this activity does not supersede the Sabbath prohibitions."
Circumcision 1.11,a child born by Caesarian section; -, See Halachah 7.
Circumcision 1.12,When a child is born beyn hash'mashot -, the period between sunset and the appearance of three stars. (See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:4.)
Circumcision 1.12,"and he is circumcised on the ninth day [following the day he was born,] which could be the eighth day. -"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 262:7) states that night depends on the appearance of three stars, and not on when the evening service is recited."
Circumcision 1.16,A sick person -," This applies not only to children who are circumcised on the eighth day of their lives, but also to those (e.g., converts or slaves) who are circumcised when they are older."
Circumcision 1.16,Seven full days should be counted from the time he regains his health until he is circumcised. -," In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:5), the Rambam writes:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Until he fully recovers from his illness and the weakness from his sickness passes. He should wait seven days from the time the weakness passes.... Only afterwards, should he be circumcised.</p>
<p>Thus, we see that the Rambam intends that the person to be circumcised fully regain his health, and then wait an additional seven days."
Circumcision 1.16,or from a similar illness. -," i.e., an illness that affects a person's entire body (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 262:2)"

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.1","Rather, they should appear as a scepter. -"," Here, too, our Sages have emphasized the homiletic lesson to be derived from this shape.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.2","i.e., there will be three or more leaves in each ring -"," on the same level.</p>
<p>Our translation follows the interpretation of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, who requires that the three leaves be on the same level over the entire length of the myrtle. However, other opinions interpret the Rambam's words to mean that a myrtle may be used if the leaves of merely one ring are on the same level. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (and similarly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 646:5) maintain that a myrtle is kosher if the leaves grow properly over three handbreadths (its minimum size), or at least the majority of that distance."

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.3",Its leaf is extended as a brook -," i.e., it comes to a point, rather than being rounded (<i>Sukkah</i> 33b).</p>

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.3","and its stem is red. It is called a willow. The majority of this species grow near brooks. Therefore, it is called the ""willows of the brook."" -"," However, the use of that name is not meant to be exclusive..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.4","There is another species which resembles the willow. However, its leaf is rounded, its edge resembles a saw -"," i.e., its edge is very jagged, with large protrusions"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.4",This is called a tzaftzefah. It is unfit [to be used for the mitzvah] -," for it is not considered to be merely a different type of willow, but rather another species entirely."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.4","does not have a smooth edge, but it is not like a saw. Rather, it has tiny juttings, like the edge of a small sickle. It is kosher. -"," The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 647:6 mentions that willows are frequently picked by young children who are not learned and may mistake a non-kosher species for a kosher one. Hence, the purchaser should carefully examine the willows before purchasing them."

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.6","The most desirable way of performing the mitzvah is to bind the lulav, myrtle, and willow together, thus making a single, unified entity from the three of them. -"," <i>Sukkah</i> 11b explains that binding the three species together is considered more attractive than taking them each individually. Thus, taking the species in this manner conforms to the general directive requiring us to perform the mitzvot in the most esthetically appealing manner possible.</p>

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.6",on the mitzvah of taking the lulav -," Our translation follows the commentary of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who notes that in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15, the Rambam states that if one recites the blessing before taking the lulav in his hand, he should conclude the blessing <i>...v'tzivanu litol lulav</i>. The blessing should be concluded <i>...v'tzivanu al netilat lulav</i> only if one has already taken the lulav in his hands."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.6","Afterwards, he takes this bound entity in his right hand and the etrog in his left hand. -"," Since three of the four species are bound together, they are held in the hand which the Torah considers of greater prominence (<i>Sukkah</i> 37b)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.6","i.e., their roots below towards the earth, and their heads upward towards the sky. -"," Even though the etrog hangs from the tree with the <i>pitam</i> downwards, its ""upright"" position is when the <i>pitam</i> faces upward (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 651:12)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.7",How many does one take of each of them? One lulav -," <i>Sukkah</i> 34b derives this concept from the fact that <a href=""/9924#v40"">Leviticus 23:40</a> writes כפת without a ו, implying a single entity, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.7",two willow branches -," because the above verse states ""willows of the brook,"" using the plural, and thus two are required (ibid.)"

However, most of the manuscripts and texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> omit that phrase. Furthermore, in one of his responsa, the Rambam states that since the Talmud mentions adding only myrtles, it is improper to add any of the other species."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.7","However, it is forbidden to add to or reduce the numbers of the other species. -"," because they are not considered to be ""adornments."""

Indeed, in general, this clause appears to be more closely related to the principles mentioned in the following chapter, where the Rambam mentions the characteristics that disqualify the various species, rather than in this chapter, where he relates the fundamental requirements of each one. Based on <i>Sukkah</i> 34a, which relates that myrtles which are not dry (a factor still common in many Diaspora communities today) are very difficult to find, we can interpret this as an almost parenthetical expression teaching that freshness is not among the fundamental requirements for a myrtle.]"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.8",The minimum size of an etrog is the size of an egg. -," 57.6 cubic centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>; in this context, 100 cubic centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.9",Once a person lifts up these four species - whether he lifts them up together -, as described in Halachah 6.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.9",whether in his right hand or in his left hand -," Although, in Halachah 6, the Rambam suggested holding the lulav together with the myrtle and willows together in his right hand and the etrog in his left, this is the most desirable way of fulfilling the mitzvah. However, even if a person does not lift up the species in this manner..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.9",This applies] only when he lifts them up as they grow. -, See Halachah 6 and the commentary on it.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.9",The fulfillment of the mitzvah as the law [requires is as follows]: One should lift up the three species as they are bound together in one's right hand and the etrog in one's left hand. -," holding the etrog together with the lulav (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:11).</p>
<p>In the <i>Beit Yosef</i>, Rav Yosef Karo quotes the following story from the Recanti. The latter dreamed that he saw a particular pious individual writing God's name with a space separating the last ה from the first three letters. He could not comprehend the dream at all until the next day, when he saw that individual holding his etrog separate from his lulav (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 651:21)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.10",What does the above entail? One passes the lulav forward -, once in each direction
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.10",brings it back -, to one's chest
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.10",One follows this same pattern when lifting it up and down. -," Thus, one will have shaken the lulav a total of 36 times."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.10",does one pass the lulav back and forth? During the reading of the Hallel -, which is recited in its entirety on each day of the Sukkot festival.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.10","and at the verse [<a href=""/16339#v25"">Psalms 118:25</a>]: Ana Ado-nai hoshi'ah na. -", It is customary to repeat this verse when reciting the <i>Hallel</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651:8) relates that the lulav is passed back and forth both times the verse is recited.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.11",If one wraps a cord of silver or gold around [the three species] as they are bound together -, The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:8) relates that the inhabitants of Jerusalem would wrap their lulavim together with golden cords.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.11",Taking the lulav through another medium is still considered to be taking it -," i.e., holding another substance in which the lulav is contained is still considered to be holding the lulav..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.11","However, if one placed these species in a vase or a pot -", <i>Sukkah</i> 42a explains that this is unbecoming to the mitzvah.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.12",If one binds the lulav together with the myrtle and the willow and separates between the lulav and the myrtle with a cloth or the like -," i.e., a substance which does not contribute to the lulav's attractiveness"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.12",If one separates between them with myrtle leaves -," i.e., if the myrtle leaves fall off and collect between the lulav and the myrtle branches,"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.12","One may bind them together with a string, a cord, or with any substance one desires -"," i.e., using substances other than the three species used in the lulav"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.13",The mitzvah of taking the lulav in every place -," i.e., even outside Jerusalem"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.13","even on the Sabbath - applies only on the first day of the festival, as [<a href=""/9924#v40"">Leviticus 23:40</a>] states: ""And on the first day, you shall take..."" -", See Halachah 16. See also the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 4:2).
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.13","it is to be taken on each of the seven days of the festival, as [the above verse] continues: ""and you shall rejoice before God, your Lord [seven days].""",
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.13",This is a decree -, instituted by the Rabbis (<i>Sukkah</i> 43a)
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.14","Why was this decree not put in effect on the first day of the festival? Because [taking the lulav on that day] is a mitzvah from the Torah even outside of Jerusalem. Thus, the laws applying to it are not the same as those applying to the remaining days -"," Taking the lulav on the first day was obviously a matter of great importance. Hence, the Sages did not feel that the fear that perhaps a person might carry the lulav in the public domain was sufficient reason to nullify the mitzvah. In contrast, on the subsequent days the mitzvah is not considered to be so severe a matter. Hence, the mitzvah could be nullified in Jerusalem as well.</p>
<p>The Rabbis question why the Sages differentiated between the lulav and the shofar, and (as explained in Halachah 2:6), nullified the mitzvah of hearing the shofar when Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath. As explained in our commentary on that halachah, in Rabbenu Nissim's commentary on the tractate of <i>Sukkah</i>, he states that this decree was instituted only because in most Jewish communities, the people were not aware of the date the court had established for Rosh Hashanah. (Note the details of the explanation there.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.15","When the Temple was destroyed, [the Sages] ordained that the lulav be taken everywhere for the entire seven days of the festival as a remembrance of the Temple. -"," <i>Sukkah</i> 41a explains the source for the establishment of remembrances for the Temple practices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<a href=""/16027#v17"">Jeremiah 30:17</a>] states: ""'I will restore health to you. I will heal you of your wounds,"" says God. 'Because they called you an outcast. Zion, for whom no one cares.'</p>
<p>The verse states ""for whom no one cares,"" implying that a show of our care is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this basis, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai established a number of practices in remembrance of the Temple practices."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.15",one recites the blessing on it: [Baruch Attah Ado-nai...] asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu al netilat lulav. -," As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 6, the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15 that it is preferable to conclude the blessing, <i>litol lulav</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that the Rambam's present statement is only a reference to his previous one, and not a reversal of his opinion. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651:5) and all later authorities recommend reciting <i>al netilat lulav</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.16",While the Temple was standing -, and the day when a new month began was established through the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.16",even] when the first day of Sukkot fell on the Sabbath. -, as stated above in Halachah 13.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.16",where they were certain that this day -, the fifteenth of Tishre
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.16","However, the places which were distantly removed from Jerusalem -"," and were not informed of the day on which Rosh Hashanah had fallen, would celebrate two days. Therefore, they..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.17",When the Temple was destroyed -, even though the new moon was still sanctified according to the testimony of witnesses. (That practice continued several hundred years after the destruction of the Temple - <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 5:3.)
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.17",to take the lulav on the Sabbath on the first day of Sukkot -, for the reasons mentioned in Halachah 13.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.17",[The guiding principle was] that the obligation [of taking the lulav] on the first day applies in all places -, and the people in the distant communities could not take the lulav when the first day fell on the Sabbath because of the doubt involved
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.18","At present, when everyone follows a fixed calendar -", See Chapter 5 of <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i>.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.18",even on the first day [of the festival]. -, when the obligation to do so is from the Torah itself.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.18",As explained -," in Halachah 13,"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.19",Whoever is obligated to fulfill [the mitzvot of] shofar and sukkah is obligated to take the lulav. Whoever is not obligated regarding shofar and sukkah is not obligated to take the lulav. -," i.e., the lulav, like the shofar and the sukkah, is a positive commandment whose observance is restricted to a specific time. Accordingly, women and slaves are under no obligation. (See Halachot 2:1 and 6:1.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.19",is obligated -, See the note on Halachah 6:1.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.20",It is a halachah conveyed by Moses from Mount Sinai -," i.e., a commandment that has the status of Torah law even though there is no explicit commandment to that effect in the Torah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.20",another willow branch was brought in the Temple. -," as described in the following halachot.</p>
<p>Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i>, (<i>Sukkah</i> 43b) explain that the mitzvah of the willow branch was only performed by the priests for only they were allowed to approach the Temple altar where the branches were arranged. However, from halachah 22, it appears that the Rambam does not share this opinion.</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 44a, b also mentions that outside the Temple there was a custom of established in the time of the prophets requiring the taking of the willow by all Jews. (See also <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:16.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.21","How was this mitzvah performed? On each of the seven days [of the festival], branches of willows were brought -"," from Motza, a small town slightly west of Jerusalem (<i>Sukkah</i> 45a)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.21",with their tops bent over the altar. -," These willow branches were eleven cubits high and were placed on the base of the altar.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they would be taken by the people, as stated in the following halachah. Rabbenu Manoach maintains that the priests would take the willow branches and give them to the people because Israelites were not allowed to approach the altar, as above. However, he notes that Rav Yitzchak ibn Giat's description of the mitzvah could be interpreted to mean that the Israelites themselves were permitted to approach the altar on this occasion."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.21","When the Sabbath fell in the midst of the festival, the willows would not be arranged [near the altar] -"," on the Sabbath, since the mitzvah of lulav was negated on such an occasion (Halachah 13). Indeed, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 4:3), the Rambam writes that the reason the mitzvah of taking the willow on the Sabbath was negated was so that people would not extend the leniency and take the lulav as well."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.21","[On such an occasion,] the willows were arranged [near the altar] -"," and the willows were taken as during the week. Though the mitzvah of lulav would not be performed on such an occasion, an exception was made regarding the willows, in order..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.22",How would they fulfill [this mitzvah on the Sabbath]? They would bring [the branches] to the Temple on the Sabbath eve and place them in golden containers so their leaves would not dry out. -," Some commentaries explain that the golden vessels were used as an expression of respect for the mitzvah. However, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> explains that, in comparison to containers made of other metals, golden ones are more beneficial in preserving the willows' freshness."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.22",Since the willow is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah -," The <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> reads: ""it is not explicitly [an obligation] from the Torah."" Accordingly, he and the other commentators debated whether the Rambam considers a halachah conveyed by Moses from Mt. Sinai as a Torah obligation or not. In <i>Hilchot Tum'at Meit</i> 2:10, the Rambam specifically states that a halachah conveyed by tradition has the power of Torah law."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.22","Rather, at present it is taken only on the seventh day. -", Hoshanah Rabbah.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.22",One takes one -, willow
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.22",in addition to the willow of the lulav and hits the ground -, The <i>Zohar</i> mentions this practice
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.23",On each day of the festival -, in the Temple
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.23","would walk around the altar once, carrying their lulavim -"," <i>Sukkah</i> 43b mentions an opinion that states that the people would walk around the altar carrying the willow branch, but concludes as the Rambam does. (See also <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 664:4.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.23","On the seventh day, they would walk around the altar seven times. - The", <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> notes that this recalls the miracle of the conquest of Jericho.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.23",and walk around it each day -," once, and seven times on <i>Hoshanah Rabbah</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.24",The following custom was observed in Jerusalem -, as an expression of the dearness with which the people regarded the mitzvah:
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.24",He would enter the synagogue with it in his hand; pray while it was in his hand -," Even though one should not ordinarily hold any objects in one's hands while praying, lest one's concentration be distracted, since holding the lulav is a mitzvah dear to a Jew's heart, it will not become a distraction."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.25",During the time the lulav was taken on the Sabbath -," See Halachot 13 and 14. At present, it is forbidden to carry the lulav on the Sabbath (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 558:2)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.25",and return it to the water on the Sabbath. -," This was not considered a violation of the Sabbath laws which prevent causing any agricultural growth. However, it was forbidden to add to the water or change it on the Sabbath because of the trouble involved."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.25",On Chol Hamo'ed -, though there are certain restrictions against work
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.26",It is forbidden to smell the myrtle in the lulav. -," As explained in Chapter 6, Halachah 15, with regard to the <i>s'chach</i> of a sukkah: after it has been set aside for use as a mitzvah, it may not be used for mundane purposes throughout the holiday."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.26","and it has been set aside for the performance of the mitzvah, it is forbidden to smell it. -"," The prohibition applies even on the Sabbath, when the lulav is not taken (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 653:2)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.27",It is forbidden to eat the etrog -," even if it has become unacceptable for use in performing the mitzvah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 665:1)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.27","since it was set aside for a portion of the day, it is set aside for the entire day. However, on the eighth day it is permitted to be eaten. -"," In contrast, the <i>s'chach</i> of the sukkah might not be used for a mundane purpose on the eighth day either (Chapter 6, Halachah 15). Rabbenu Manoach explains the difference, relating that - should one desire to eat - the sukkah must also be used <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> - the period between sunset and the appearance of three stars - while the lulav would not be taken during that time."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.27",even though the etrog is not taken on the eighth day -," The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes the contrast between the mitzvot of lulav and of the sukkah, which, as mentioned in Chapter 6, Halachah 13, must be fulfilled on the eighth day of the festival. He differentiates between the two, noting that it is a mitzvah from the Torah to dwell in the sukkah for all seven days of the holiday. Therefore, because of the doubt, that mitzvah was also observed on the eighth day. In contrast, outside of Jerusalem there was never a mitzvah from the Torah to take the lulav for seven days. Hence, that mitzvah need not be observed on the eighth day.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds a further point. It is forbidden to carry the lulav for no purpose on the eighth day, the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. No such prohibition applies regarding the use of the sukkah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.27",since it was forbidden on the eighth day -," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> advises amending the text to read ""on the seventh day."" In either case, the intent is the same - because it was forbidden by law on the seventh day, that prohibition was observed on the eighth day as well, because of the doubt involved."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.1",There are eight requirements in the making of <i>tefillin</i>. All of them are halachot transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai -," In Chapter 1, Halachah 3, the Rambam mentioned that there were ten requirements for <i>tefillin</i> that were communicated as ""halachot transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai."" The first two involve the actual composition of the <i>tefillin</i>. They, and the other laws involving that subject, were discussed in the first two chapters. Now the Rambam discusses the requirements involved in making the <i>tefillin</i>'s compartments and straps."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.1",They are: a) The <i>tefillin</i> must be square -," There is a homiletic dimension to this requirement. Nothing is naturally square. Thus, this shape alludes to man's power of achievement. Wearing <i>tefillin</i> on our heads and opposite our hearts implies that we should exercise our powers of achievement when our minds and hearts are tied to God's mitzvot.</p>
<p>The base of the <i>tefillin</i> must also be square. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:39) states that this is also a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:59 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:181, which state that since the squareness of <i>tefillin</i> is a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai, the <i>tefillin</i> must remain square at all times. If over the course of time, their shape changes, they may no longer be used."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.1",[Both] diagonals -, of the square on the top and the base of the <i>tefillin</i>
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.1",and thus all four angles will be equal. -, Each one being 90 degrees. See Halachot 2 and 4.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.1",c) The passages should be wrapped in fabric. -, See Halachah 8.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.1",e) They should be sewn [closed] with the sinews [of an animal]. -, See Halachot 9-10.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.1",g) The straps should be black. -, See Halachot 14.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.2",How are the head <i>tefillin</i> made? We take a cubic wooden block.-," This appears to be the Rambam's preference. It is not, however, an absolute requirement."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.2",Three grooves are carved into it so that four projections will be made as depicted. -," The accompanying diagram is based on a drawing by the Rambam himself, which has been copied in all printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.2","and soaked in water, and then, the mold is placed within it. -"," The authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> read, ""The leather is placed around the mold."" This version more accurately describes the process with which <i>tefillin</i> are actually made."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.2","While [the leather] is still wet, it is plucked and squeezed -"," with tweezers. The <i>Orchot Chayim</i> states that one must make the <i>shin</i> in this manner, and it is unacceptable to use a mold. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32), <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:65, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:193 all mention that though it is theoretically preferable to follow the <i>Orchot Chayim's</i> ruling, nevertheless, until recently, most <i>shinim</i> were made using a mold. At present, however, there are some manufacturers of <i>tefillin</i> who have reverted to the practice of making the <i>shin</i> with tweezers."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.2",with three heads -, This is the usual form of the <i>shin</i>.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.3","The leather is then left on the mold until it dries, and then it is removed. Thus, the leather will be [formed into a block] with four empty compartments.",
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.3",in each compartment -," In Halachah 5, the Rambam describes the order in which the passages are placed into the compartments."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.3",and then they are sewn closed on all four corners. -, The precise manner in which the <i>tefillin</i> are sewn closed is described in Halachah 10.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.3",like a handle. -," Alternatively, ""loop"" (<i>Aruch</i>).</p>
<p>The width of this ""handle"" should be less than the width of the base of the <i>tefillin</i>, to distinguish it from the base and thus accentuate the base's squareness (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:177)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.4",How are the <i>tefillin</i> of the arm made? We take a wooden block whose length is equal to its width -," Here, also, a square shape is required at the top of the <i>tefillin</i>, along its entire height, and at its base."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.4",or slightly more or slightly less - high -," Curiously, though the Rambam mentions the preferred size for the arm <i>tefillin</i> in this halachah, he did not suggest a size for the head <i>tefillin</i> in the previous two halachot. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:62 relates that people of stature should wear head <i>tefillin</i> that are at least three fingerbreadths high.</p>
<p><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:63 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:189 mention that the width and length of the base of the <i>tefillin</i> should be more than one fingerbreadth. Preferably, the width and length of the head <i>tefillin</i> should be two fingerbreadths."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.4","The leather is left on this mold until it has dried, and then it is removed. The four passages -", which are written on a single piece of parchment
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.4","A portion of the leather is folded over beneath them, and then they are sewn closed on all four corners. -", See Halachah 10.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.5","What is the order of the passages? For the head <i>tefillah</i>, the final passage, V'hayah im shamo'a -"," The order of the passages chosen by the Rambam - when read by a person facing the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i> - reflects their order in the Torah (<i>Menachot</i> 34b). Hence, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> is referred to as the final passage."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.5","Thus, a person who is facing the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i> will read them in the following order. -"," The diagram accompanying this halachah is based on a diagram drawn by the Rambam himself and included in all texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</p>
<p>Thus, the Rambam (and similarly, Rabbenu Tam and those who follow his opinion) considered that the order of the passages be calculated from the perspective of a person standing opposite the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i>. In contrast, there are other opinions (<i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> and the Ra'avad) who maintain that the order of the passages should be calculated from the perspective of the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i>. (This produces two further perspectives regarding the order of the <i>tefillin</i>. The <i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> follows the same order as the Rambam except that <i>V'hoyoh im Shamoa</i>, is placed in the first compartment on the left side of the person putting on the <i>tefillin</i>, not on the right side. Similarly, the Ra'avad shares Rabbenu Tam's view, but reverses the sides.)"
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.6",[The passages for] the arm <i>tefillin</i> are written on four columns -, each passage being written on a separate column
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.6",like a Torah scroll -," i.e., the parchment is rolled closed."

Although the Rambam considers this requirement to be a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai, the Ashkenazic authorities do not agree. Accordingly, they maintain that, after the fact, if the passages are not wrapped in this parchment, the <i>tefillin</i> may still be used (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:68; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:205).</p>
<p>The difference between the Rambam and the Ashkenazic authorities depends on their interpretation of a passage from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megilah</i>, Chapter 1). This difference in interpretation is also reflected in the laws regarding correcting a torn Torah scroll. See Chapter 9, Halachah 15."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.8",This hair should be from a kosher species of animal or beast. -," As explained in Chapter 1, Halachah 10, all the elements required for <i>tefillin</i> must be made from species which may be eaten."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.8",[their hair is nevertheless acceptable]. -," As explained in the commentary on the above-mentioned halachah, although these animals themselves may not be eaten, since they come from a kosher species, they are not disqualified."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.8",of a calf -, To recall the sin of the Golden Calf (<i>Shimusha Rabbah</i>).
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.9","When the <i>tefillin</i> are sewn closed, they may be sewn only with sinews -"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:50) states that if sinews are not available, one may sew the <i>tefillin</i> closed with thread made from parchment, until sinews are available. Although there are opinions which object to this ruling, it should be followed if there is no other alternative (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:76; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:227)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.9",[Sinews taken from] animals which died without being ritually slaughtered or which were <i>treifah</i>s [are nevertheless acceptable]. -, See the previous halachah.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.9","Afterwards, they are spun and twisted into threads -"," Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:75, which states that the process of spinning the sinews into thread must be carried out with the intent that they be used for this sacred purpose.

If some of the stitches are torn, he explains, then the shape of these stitches may no longer be square, and that is the difficulty to which the Rambam is referring. Thus, he interprets טבלה is referring to ""the square shape of the stitches."""
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.19","Should a strap be torn, [the pieces] should not be tied or sewn together. - <i>Menachot</i> 35b derives this concept from the word וקשרתם, “And you shall tie them.""

Torah Study 3.1,Aaron merited -," The <i>Sifre, ibid.</i>, states: ""Aaron merited and took it."" The Rambam omits the latter term, since priesthood (and, similarly, royalty) are not attributes that can be acquired by human effort, but rather must be conveyed by God."
Torah Study 3.1,"as [<a href=""/9953#v13"">Numbers 25:13</a>] states: ""And it will be an eternal covenant of priesthood for him and his descendants after him."" -", See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 4:1.

Similarly, on the verse from Deuteronomy quoted below, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 59a comments: ""It is our inheritance and not theirs.""</p>
<p>[Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that the same passage in <i>Sanhedrin</i> also describes the high levels which a gentile can attain by studying the rules of the seven general laws of human behavior given to Noah and his descendants.

Torah Study 3.1,Whoever desires -," In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 4:17, the Rambam relates the content of this halachah and uses the expression: ""Whoever desires to be crowned with the crown of Torah."""

Torah Study 3.2,Our Sages - <i>Horayot</i> 13a<br/>,
Torah Study 3.2,deserves precedence over a high priest who is unlearned -," Though such a phenomenon was undesirable, it often occurred in the Second Temple period, when the High Priests were appointed by the Romans in return for excessive bribes. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Yoma</i> 1:3.)"
Torah Study 3.2,"[That verse can be interpreted] - <i>Horayot, ibid.</i>, to mean:<br/>",
Torah Study 3.3,"None of the other mitzvot can be equated to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah can be equated to all the mitzvot -"," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1 as the source for this statement. That Mishnah lists a number of mitzvot whose ""benefits are enjoyed in this world, though the principle [reward] remains for the world to come"" and concludes ""the study of Torah is equivalent to them all.""</p>
<p>However, the <i>Lev Shlomo</i> notes that the antecedents of the phrase ""them all"" are the various mitzvot which are mentioned previously in the mishnah and not ""all the mitzvot of the Torah."" Hence, he refers to the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1), which states: ""All the mitzvot of the Torah are not worth one word of the Torah."""
Torah Study 3.3,"Therefore, study takes precedence over deed -"," See Chapter 1, Halachah 3, and the commentary on it.</p>
<p>Though there is a similarity between the halachah cited above and the present one, the two are not redundant. That halachah deals with the course of action proper for a person whose father has not instructed him in Torah study. Thus, the Rambam tells him that rather than ignore Torah study and devote himself to the performance of good deeds alone, he should study.</p>
<p>This chapter centers around the principle that Torah study is the highest rung a person can reach. Accordingly, the advice in this and the following halachah applies to even a person who has established a basis of Torah knowledge. It teaches him to seek personal fulfillment in study rather than in deed. Similarly, it advises us that the most propitious way to use each moment of spare time is to devote these moments to Torah study."
Torah Study 3.4,[The following rules apply] when a person is confronted with the performance of a mitzvah and the study of Torah -, and the performance of the mitzvah would cause him to interrupt his studies.
Torah Study 3.4,If not -," If there is no way the mitzvah can be performed by another person - e.g., paying honor to a deceased person or collecting for charity, when one's position will cause one's words to have a greater effect than those of other people..."
Torah Study 3.4,"The rationale behind the above statements can be explained as follows: As explained in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 3, the ultimate level of fulfillment man can reach is to step beyond his humanity and fulfill God's will, as revealed in the mitzvot. Nevertheless, priority is given to Torah study, because it possesses a twofold advantage over the other mitzvot: first, it leads to their fulfillment; second, it allows for an internalized connection to be established between the person and God.<br/>",
Torah Study 3.5,The first aspect of a person's judgement [in the world to come] will center on Torah study. Only afterwards will his other deeds [be considered]. -," The statement is based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7a. Other sources (<i>Shabbat</i> 31a) state that the first question posed to a person in the world to come will be: ""Did you deal faithfully in business?""</p>
<p><i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> <i>ibid.</i>, offers two possible resolutions to this apparent contradiction:<br/>
a) A person who never studied at all is judged first regarding Torah study. However, one who studied, but did not establish fixed times for study is judged first regarding his business affairs;<br/>
b) Even though the first question that the soul is asked centers on his business affairs, the first retribution he will receive will result from his neglect of Torah study."
Torah Study 3.5,"would say: ""A person should always occupy himself in Torah study, whether for God's sake or even if not for God's sake -"," The Rambam elaborates further on the definition of these concepts in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 10:4-5:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">The Sages of the previous generations declared: Should one say: ""I will study Torah in order that I become wealthy, in order that I be called a Rabbi, or in order that I receive reward in the world to come?"" The Torah teaches [<a href=""/9975#v13"">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>]: ""[If you are careful to observe My commandments...] to love God;"" [implying] that all that you do should be done only out of love.<br/>
The Sages also said: [<a href=""/16333#v1"">Psalms 112:1</a> instructs:] ""Desire His commandments greatly."" [Desire His commandments] and not the reward [that comes from] His commandments...<br/>
Anyone who occupies himself with the Torah in order to receive reward or in order to protect himself from retribution is considered as one who is not occupied for God's sake.<br/>
[In contrast,] anyone who occupies himself with it, not because of fear, nor to receive a reward, but rather because of his love for the Lord of the entire earth, Who commanded it, is one who occupies himself for God's sake."
Torah Study 3.6,A person whose heart inspires him to fulfill this mitzvah in a fitting manner -," As explained in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 8, the Rambam's statements imply that there are two aspects of Torah study:<br/>
a) The obligation to study Torah, which is incumbent on every individual: the establishment of fixed times for Torah study (Chapter 1, Halachah 8).<br/>
b) A commitment to devote oneself to Torah study that has no limitations.</p>
<p>The first aspect reflects a commitment that takes into consideration man's perspective, and, hence, is limited in scope. However, when a person views the Torah from God's perspective and appreciates its infinite nature, he will be inspired to make an unbounded commitment to Torah study. See also the commentary on the halachah mentioned above."
Torah Study 3.6,should not divert his attention to other matters. -," On <a href=""/9970#v7"">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>: ""Speak of them,"" the <i>Sifre</i> comments: ""Speak of them, and not of other matters."""
Torah Study 3.6,"[Rather,] this is the path of Torah -"," This statement and the others in this halachah are a combination of quotes from <i>Avot</i> 6:4, 2:17 and 5:23."
Torah Study 3.6,The task is not incumbent upon you to complete -," If a person contemplates the totality of Torah knowledge which there is to grasp, he may be intimidated and unwilling to begin such an undertaking. Hence, he is counselled that he is not expected to complete its study. However,..."
Torah Study 3.6,"If you have acquired much Torah, you have acquired much reward -"," The Mishnah continues to explain that the reward for the righteous will be in the world to come.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand why the Rambam emphasizes the aspect of reward, when in the previous halachah he stressed how one should not study Torah for ulterior motives. Included in the latter is also the reward in the world to come."
Torah Study 3.7,"Perhaps, one will say: ""[I will interrupt my studies] until after I gather money, and then I will return and study, [I will interrupt my studies] until after I buy what I need, and then, when I can divert my attention from my business, I will return and study."" -"," Note Chapter 1, Halachah 5, which counsels studying Torah before marriage, so the yoke of financial responsibility will not interfere with one's studies."
Torah Study 3.8,"It is written in the Torah [<a href=""/9994#v12"">Deuteronomy 30:12</a>, 13]: -"," Rav Kapach renders this: ""It is written about the Torah,"" emphasizing that according to the Rambam, the antecedent of the pronoun ""it"" in the above verse is Torah study and not Teshuvah, as explained by the Ramban and others."
Torah Study 3.8,"""It is not across the sea"" - i.e., it is not found in those who travel across the sea -"," for business purposes. In contrast, one is advised to travel to study Torah, as <i>Avot</i> relates: ""Exile yourself to a place of Torah."""
Torah Study 3.8,"""Not everyone who is involved in business will become wise."" -"," In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam quotes the content of this halachah."
Torah Study 3.8,"""Minimize your business activities and occupy -"," The Hebrew, <i>la’asok</i>, is also used in the Ashkenazic text of the blessings recited before Torah study. In most contexts, that word is rendered as ""business."" Thus, employing it in the blessing implies that the manner in which a person applies himself to Torah study should resemble the way a businessman applies himself to his business, making it the central matter of his life."
Torah Study 3.9,"The words of Torah can be compared to water, as [<a href=""/15986#v1"">Isaiah 55:1</a>] states: ""Behold, all who are thirsty, come to the water."" -", <i>Ta'anit</i> 7a mentions the ideas related by the Rambam as well as other dimensions of the comparison between Torah and water.
Torah Study 3.9,"but rather in the humble and lowly, who sit in the dust at the feet of the Sages -"," The Rambam borrows the phraseology of <i>Avot</i> 1:4. Others render the phrase: ""Become dusty [pursuing] the Sages' feet"" - i.e., follow them everywhere out of thirst to learn from them.</p>
<p>and remove the desires and pleasures of the times from their hearts - See Halachah 12."
Torah Study 3.9,The rest of their days and nights -, See Halachah 13.
Torah Study 3.10,Anyone who comes to the conclusion that he should involve himself in Torah study without doing work and derive his livelihood from charity desecrates [God's] name -," In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 5, and <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 1:4, the Rambam mentions the severity of the sin of desecrating God's name."

Torah Study 3.10,"Also, they commanded and declared: -"," <i>Avot, ibid.</i> The Rambam reverses the order of the statements in the Mishnah, perhaps, because the first clause is more explicit.

Torah Study 3.11,It is a tremendous advantage for a person to derive his livelihood from his own efforts -, and not from charity.
Torah Study 3.11,"In this manner, one will merit all the honor -"," One of the rationales given by many of the Rabbis who permit scholars to derive benefit from their studies is that performing menial work will cheapen the common man's appreciation of them, and thus minimize the honor given to the Torah.</p>

Originally, a person who had a father would be instructed by him, while a person who had no father would not be instructed...<br/>
[Afterwards,] they instituted [the practice of] employing teachers of young children in Jerusalem [as implied by the verse]: ""From Zion shall go forth the Torah.""<br/>
Nevertheless, whoever had a father would be taken [to Jerusalem], while one who did not have a father would not be taken. [Therefore,] they instituted [the practice of] employing teachers in every region. They would begin study at sixteen or at seventeen.<br/>
However, if a [student's] teacher were angry with him, he would scoff at him and leave. [This situation persisted] until Yehoshua ben Gamla came and instituted [the practice of] employing teachers of young children in each and every land, in each and every region, and in each and every village. They would bring them [to the schools] at the age of six or seven.<br/></b></p>
<p>This practice was continued in the subsequent generations. Even though the dispersion of the Jewish people and the subjugation to the gentile powers made the management of their communal affairs more difficult, throughout the ages we find references to the establishment of communal programs of education in both the codes of Jewish law and the chronicles of Jewish history. (See Ramah, <i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, 163:3; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:3.)</p>
<p>Originally, it was customary for the community to impose taxes to pay for the education of all the children, whether their parents were rich or poor. However, at present it has become customary for each parent to pay for his own child's education. However, if he lacks the financial means to do so, the community is obligated to accept this burden.</p>
<p>If a village does not have children who study Torah, the city's populace is placed under a ban of ostracism - See Chapter 7, Halachah 5 for a precise definition of this term."

Though our text of that passage differs slightly from the statements here, in the various commentaries and codes (e.g., the <i>She'eltot</i> of Rabbenu Achai Gaon, the <i>Halachot</i> of Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi), we find various versions of that passage. Hence, it is possible to assume that the Rambam's statements are a quote from his text of the Talmud."
Torah Study 2.2,Children should be brought to study [under a teacher's instruction] -," As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 6 and the commentary on it, even before a child reached that age his father would teach him particular verses from the Torah."
Torah Study 2.2,according to the child's health and build. -, This would determine when he would be able to begin the long and rigorous study program described in this halachah.
Torah Study 2.2,A teacher may employ corporal punishment to cast fear upon [the students]. -," The advice that <a href=""/16384#v24"">Proverbs 13:24</a> gives a father: ""He that spares the rod, hates his son,"" also applies to a teacher. Indeed, <i>Makkot</i> 8a equates a teacher to a father in this respect.</p>
<p><i>Makkot</i> 22b relates that <a href=""/16217#v6"">Zechariah 13:6</a>, ""What are these wounds?...Those which I was wounded in the house of my beloved,"" refers to the beatings administered to school children.</p>
<p>See also Chapter 3, Halachah 12 and Chapter 4, Halachah 5."
Torah Study 2.2,"Therefore, he should not beat them with a rod or a staff, but rather with a small strap. -"," <i>Bava Batra</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) relates that Rav instructed Rav Shmuel bar Shilat (a well known teacher of children):</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;""><b>When you beat a child, beat him only with a sandal strap. If [it motivates him] to study, then he will study. If he does not study, let him be in the company of the others.<br/></b></p>
<p>From Rav's words, we can infer that corporal punishment may be employed to try to motivate a student to be more attentive. However, if it does not prove to be a successful tool, it should not be used further, lest it create a permanent aversion to Torah study.</p>
<p>[The teacher] should sit and instruct them the entire day and for a portion of the night, to train them to study during the day and night. - So that as adults, they will be accustomed to fulfilling the obligation mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 8."
Torah Study 2.2,and on the festivals themselves. -, for study might disturb a child's conception of the air of rejoicing and celebration that must accompany the festivals. It must be noted that the Rambam suggests that adults use some of their time on the festivals to study (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 6:19).
Torah Study 2.2,they should not begin new material -," for grasping it may involve difficulty and strain, which should be avoided on the Sabbath. (See <i>Nedarim</i> 37a.)"
Torah Study 2.2,"The children should never be interrupted from their studies, even for the building of the Temple. -"," <i>Shabbat</i> 119b makes this statement in the context of its description of the great merit of the children's study, as mentioned in the previous halachah. Indeed, this appears to be the Rambam's logic in the entire halachah. Since children's study is so important, no unnecessary interruptions should be made."
Torah Study 2.3,A teacher of children who leaves the children and goes out -," <i>Bava Batra</i> 8b relates that Rav once found Rav Shmuel bar Shilat strolling in a garden. He reproved him: ""Have you abandoned your faithfulness?""</p>
<p>Rav Shmuel answered him: ""You haven't seen me [strolling like this] for thirteen years. Furthermore, even now I am thinking about them."""
Torah Study 2.3,or is lazy in their instruction -," As is obvious from <i>Hilchot S'chirut</i> 10:7, this includes two elements:<br/>
a) one who did not instruct the students; or<br/>
b) one who erred in their instruction."
Torah Study 2.3,and instructs them carefully. -, <i>Bava Batra</i> 21a-b emphasizes the importance of precise study by relating the following story:
Torah Study 2.3,"David told him: ""You are mistaken; the verse reads 'Wipe out the memory (<i>zecher</i>) of Amalek.’“<br/>",
Torah Study 2.4,"should not teach children, because of the mothers who visit the children. -"," ""lest he be aroused by women"" (<i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>)."
Torah Study 2.5,"[A maximum of] 25 students should study under one teacher. If there are more than 25, but fewer than 40, an assistant -"," Note the commentary of the <i>Nimukei Yosef</i> on <i>Bava Batra</i> 21a, which resolves the apparent contradiction between the Rambam's decision and that passage. Rabbenu Asher interprets that passage differently."
Torah Study 2.5,If there are more than forty students -, the class should be divided and...
Torah Study 2.6,"A child may be transferred from one teacher to another teacher, who is capable of teaching him at a faster pace -", Note the commentary on Halachah 4 for a definition of the word <i>mahir</i>.
Torah Study 2.6,This applies when both are located in the same city -," The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam derives this concept from <i>Bava Batra</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), which states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">From the time of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Gamla, a child was not transferred from city to city, but he would be transferred from synagogue to synagogue...</p>
<p>The Rambam interprets that statement to mean that once the practice of employing qualified teachers in each community was instituted, there was no longer a need to transfer a child from his home town to another city. However, within his city itself, he could be transferred from one house of study to another if there was adequate reason."
Torah Study 2.6,"or even from one side of the river to the other in the same city, -", because of the danger involved.
Torah Study 2.7,"Similarly, should one teacher of children come and open a schoolroom next to the place [where] a colleague [was teaching], so that other children will come to him or so that the children [studying under his] colleague shall come to him, his colleague may not lodge a protest against him -"," though such a practice would not be allowed in any other profession [if the new competitor came from a different country (see <i>Hilchot Sh'chenim</i> 6:8)], an exception is made regarding teaching Torah because..."
Torah Study 2.7,"The <i>Yad Malachi</i> explains that the Rambam frequently substitutes a different verse or explanation for the one quoted by the Talmud if he feels that his choice is more explanatory. However, the advantage of the verse chosen by the Rambam over the reason given by the Talmud requires explanation.<br/>",
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.1","[These are the rules governing] the four species: the lulav, the myrtle, the willow, and the etrog. If one of them was: a) dried out -"," The etrog is described as פרי עץ הדר (the fruit of the beautiful tree). <i>Sukkah</i> 31a explains that an analogy is established among the various species, and all of them must be ""beautiful."" Fruit or branches that are dried out do not fit the latter description.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 645:5, 646:7) defines ""drying out"" as losing all its green and fading to a whitish color. The Ramah mentions an even more lenient opinion."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.1","or stolen - גנבה - petty theft and the like. Though in other areas there are differences between these two categories of theft, in this context the same laws apply.","</p>
<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam explains that any of the species which are stolen may not be used for the mitzvah, because a sin may not serve as the medium with which a mitzvah will be performed (מצוה הבאה בעבירה). (See also <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:7; <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach</i> 5:7, 5:9.)</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 29b-30a mentions this reason, but also a second explanation: because, as stated in Halachah 10, on the first day of the festival a person must own the four species he uses for the mitzvah. (See the commentary on Halachah 9 for a further discussion of this matter.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.1",c) came from an ashera -," a tree which is worshiped as a deity. It is also forbidden to be used for the mitzvah, on the basis of the principle that a sin may not serve as the medium with which a mitzvah will be performed (מצוה הבאה בעבירה) (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, ibid.)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.1",d) or it came from an apostate city -," All the property of an apostate city must be destroyed. Therefore, any of the four species that come from such a city is considered to have no size at all, and, thus, is unacceptable for use in the mitzvah. (See also the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 3.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.1",If one of them belonged to an idolater -," but was not worshiped itself (Rabbenu Manoach); i.e., it grew in a garden of the temple of an idol. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 649:3) explains that it applies even when the tree itself was worshiped."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.1","If it was taken, the person has fulfilled his obligation -"," provided the tree had belonged to a gentile and the latter had nullified its connection with idol worship before it came into the Jew's possession. Alternatively, on any day of the festival but the first, one may take it even before its connection with idol worship was nullified. Since the possibility exists that it can be nullified, it is not considered to be a nonexistent entity. (See also the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 3.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.1","In extreme situations or in a time of danger, a dried out lulav is kosher. -"," <i>Sukkah</i> 32b relates that the inhabitants of the large cities would bequeath their lulavim to their descendants as part of their estate. Obviously, the lulavim would have dried out during this time."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.2",An etrog -," These laws apply only to an etrog, because the agricultural prohibitions mentioned in this halachah apply only to fruit and not to mere branches (Rabbenu Manoach)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.2",of impure terumah -," <i>Terumah</i> refers to the portion of produce which must be separated and given to a priest (<a href=""/9946#v12"">Numbers 18:12)</a>. If the <i>terumah</i> becomes ritually impure, it is no longer permitted to be eaten and must be destroyed (<i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 12:1).</p>
<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:8), the Rambam writes that etrogim of <i>orlah</i> and impure <i>terumah</i> are not acceptable because ""they must be destroyed by burning. Therefore, they are unacceptable, because God requires 'a fruit,' and these are not fit to be eaten at all."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.2",is unacceptable.,
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.2","is permitted, for it is possible for a person to declare all of his property as ownerless. -"," In his Commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam states ""he can consecrate all his property to the Temple."" In practice, there is no difference between the two."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.2",An etrog of pure terumah and of ma'aser sheni in Jerusalem -," In the first, second, fourth, and fifth years of the seven-year agricultural cycle, the second tithe had to be taken to Jerusalem and eaten there in a state of ritual purity (<a href=""/9978#v22"">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>-27).</p>
<p>The Rambam maintains that one can use an etrog of <i>ma'aser sheni</i> for the mitzvah only while in Jerusalem, since that is the only place that it is permitted to be eaten (Commentary on the Mishnah, ibid.). However, Rabbenu Nissim and others differ and allow such an etrog to be used for the mitzvah in other places as well. They maintain that though we are not allowed to benefit from <i>ma'aser sheni</i> outside Jerusalem, the fulfillment of mitzvot is not an act of personal benefit."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.3",A lulav whose tip -," According to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and Rabbenu Manoach, this refers to the center leaf that extends outward from the <i>shidrah</i>, and not the <i>shidrah</i> itself. Rabbenu Asher and the Ra'avad explain that this refers to the majority of the lulav's leaves, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 645:6) quotes their opinion. However, the Ramah quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>'s statements."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.3","Should it become split to the extent that the two sides of the split become severed and appear to be two, it is unacceptable. -"," <i>Sukkah</i> 31b, 32a states: A lulav which is split is kosher; [but] if it is like a fork, it is not. The commentaries explain that the Talmud refers to a shape like a tuning fork, where the two ends are distant from each other. The commentaries explain that such a separation can disqualify a lulav even if the majority of leaves are not split in this manner, and hence, the principles mentioned in the following halachah would not apply."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.3","so that its shidrah appears like a hunchback, it is unacceptable -"," <i>Sukkah</i> (ibid.) states: If it is bent like a scythe, it is unacceptable. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> emphasizes that the bend must be severe (as described by the examples given by the Talmud and the Rambam). However, a slight curve will not disqualify a lulav."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.3","it is kosher, since that is its natural pattern of growth -"," and this can be considered as a ""beautiful"" lulav (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 645:19). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 645:9) differentiates between when the <i>shidrah</i> bends gradually and when it is bent over to the extent that its tip points downward. In the latter case, even if it is bent backwards, the lulav is unacceptable."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.3","If its leaves have separated one from the other, but they have not begun to hang downward like the top of a date palm -"," i.e., the leaves are still firm and pointed upward (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 3:1)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.4","The natural pattern of growth of the leaves of the lulav is that two grow in pairs, connected at their back. The back of each pair of connected leaves is called the tiyomet. If the tiyomet is split, it is unacceptable. -"," The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam maintains that the lulav is not acceptable only if the majority of the leaves are split. However, others (Rashi, <i>Tosafot</i>) explain that this law refers to the middle leaf alone. If the majority of that leaf is split, the lulav is unacceptable. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 645:3) quotes the Rambam's opinion, while the Ramah favors that of Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.5",A myrtle branch whose top is cut off is acceptable. -," Since the myrtle branch is covered by its leaves, the fact that its top is cut off is not noticeable (Rabbenu Manoach).</p>
<p>Though the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:2) states that such a myrtle is unacceptable, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 34b) states that the halachah follows Rabbi Tarfon, whose opinion is quoted by the Rambam in this halachah.</p>
<p>In his commentary on this halachah, the Ra'avad states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a number of years, the spirit of prophecy has been present in our chamber of study, and we have determined that [such a myrtle] is not acceptable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 646:10) quotes the Rambam's opinion. However, the Ramah writes that it is proper to adhere to the Ra'avad's view if possible. However, he quotes Rabbenu Nissim, who maintains that the top of a myrtle is only considered to be ""cut off"" when the top of the branch is broken. The leaves' falling off is not considered of significance."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.5","When there are more berries than leaves, [the following rules apply:] If they are green, it is kosher -", for their color is the same as the leaves of the myrtle.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.5",it is not acceptable -," since this is not considered to be ""beautiful"" (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 33b)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.5",it is acceptable.,
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.5",on the holiday itself -," i.e., on the first day of the festival, when the restrictions against work apply"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.5",If one transgressed and removed them or removed them one by one to eat them -," which is permitted. <i>Sukkah</i> 33b states that permission is granted, provided only that one has another myrtle to use for the mitzvah. Otherwise, it is forbidden to eat the berries, because through one's activity one will definitely make the myrtle fit for use. Hence, even though one's act was motivated by another intention as well, it is forbidden. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 646:13.)</p>
<p>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quotes a slightly different version of the text, substituting ""or if they were removed by another person"" for the phrase ""removed them one by one."" Authentic Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> follow the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>'s text."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.6",A willow branch whose top is cut off is kosher. -," The Rambam maintains that the laws pertaining to the willow parallel those governing a myrtle. However, even many of the Sages who accept the Rambam's opinion regarding the myrtle disagree with regard to the willow. They explain that such a myrtle is acceptable because its leaves cover the branch's severed top. This concept does not apply with regard to a willow. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 647:2) also states that such a willow is unacceptable."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7",If an etrog is perforated -, even though none of the etrog's substance is missing
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7",no matter how small the hole is -," i.e., even if it was perforated with a thin needle"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7","When [the hole] does not go from side to side, if it is the size of an isar -"," a silver coin from the Talmudic period, four barley corns in size (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 3:6)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7",[the etrog] is not acceptable. -," Here, too, the Ra'avad differs and maintains that as long as none of the etrog's substance is lacking, it is kosher."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7","If its pitam - i.e., the small protrusion from which its flower grows -"," The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> differentiates between the stem of the <i>pitam</i> and its tip from which its flower grew, maintaining that only the removal of the former disqualifies the etrog for use. The Ramah (ibid. 7) quotes this opinion as halachah. However, he suggests trying to use an etrog whose <i>pitam</i> is entirely complete."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7","[Similarly,] if the stem from which it hangs from the tree is removed from the etrog itself and a hole is left, it is not acceptable. -"," However, if only part of the stem is cut off and the portion attached to the etrog remains, it is kosher (Ramah, ibid. 8)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7",in two or three places -," The Ra'avad asks why both the numbers two and three are mentioned. In response, the <i>Mishneh Lamelech</i> quotes many examples of the use of similar terminology throughout the Talmud. It must be noted that the Rambam, in his commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (648:19) mention only two places."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7",Even if it is covered with bumps in only one place -," i.e., as long as there is no place for an additional bump between the two, it is considered to be one place (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, ibid.)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7","it is not acceptable. [Similarly,] if a bump grows on even the slightest portion of the pitam -"," See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, ibid."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7",If its peel is removed without causing [the etrog] to lose any substance and it remains greenish yellow as in its natural state -," i.e, only the outer coating of the peel was removed and the thick, white inner peel is not yet revealed. Should this peel be revealed, the etrog is considered as though it has lost some of its substance (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, ibid.)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.7",If even the slightest portion of the original peel remains -," the peel could have regenerated itself if it had remained connected to the tree (<i>Levush</i>, ibid.). Therefore,..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.8",An etrog which is inflated -," i.e., water fell on it <b>after</b> being detached from the tree and it became inflated (Rabbenu Manoach, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 648:15)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.8",pickled -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 15) defines ""pickled"" as ""placed in vinegar."" However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (648:22) maintains that ""pickled"" should be interpreted according to its definition in the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> (105:1-2). Thus, if an etrog has been soaked in water or in any other liquid for more than 24 hours straight, it is considered to be ""pickled"" and disqualified for use. One should take care regarding this matter when soaking etrogim to preserve their freshness."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.8","black, white, spotted -"," i.e., a mixture of any two or more colors. When the different color is concentrated in only one place, the etrog is not disqualified unless that color covers more than half the etrog's surface area. However, if there is more than one spot of different colors, it is disqualified regardless of their size (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid. 16)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.8","If it was grown in a mold and shaped into the form of another creation, it is unacceptable -"," It is not considered ""beautiful"" because its natural form was changed (Rabbenu Manoach)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.8",and an unripe etrog are kosher. -," <i>Sukkah</i> 31b mentions etrogim which are small and green as being not fully ripe. However, since the Rambam mentioned those factors previously, it appears that here the intent is different and refers to a fruit that is not yet ready to be eaten, even though it is as large as an egg and has begun to turn yellow. (See also Sukkah 36a.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.9",All the species which we categorized as unacceptable because of the blemishes we described -," <i>Sukkah</i> 36b relates that Rabbi Chanina would eat from an etrog and then use it for the mitzvah. Though an etrog which is lacking even the slightest amount of its substance may not be used (Halachah 7), he still fulfilled his obligation with it. From this incident, our Sages concluded that, on the later days, even such an etrog is kosher.</p>
<p>According to the Rambam's opinion, the same applies to all other physical blemishes on the species. Since there is no greater blemish than an etrog which is bitten into, none of the requirements for ""beauty"" must be observed on the later days.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 29b and Rabbenu Asher maintain that this leniency applies only to etrogim which are lacking in substance. All the species which were disqualified because they are not ""beautiful"" may not be used on the later days as well. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 649:5 quotes the Rambam, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (649:17) and the <i>Taz</i> (649:9) quote the other view."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.9",are [disqualified for use] only on the first day of the festival. -," As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, there are two explanations why a stolen lulav may not be used on the first day:</p>
<p>a) a sin may not serve as the medium with which a mitzvah will be performed (מצוה הבאה בעבירה);</p>
<p>b) as stated in Halachah 10, on the first day of the festival a person must own the four species he uses for the mitzvah.</p>
<p>The commentaries explain that the Rambam follows the latter rationale. However, those who follow the first opinion (the Ra'avad, the Ramban, Rabbenu Asher) forbid the use of stolen species on the later days as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) quotes the Rambam, while the Ramah follows the other view.</p>
<p>[Though the above explanation is frequently used, it is difficult to accept. First, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam mentions the reason of מצוה הבאה בעבירה. Also, in <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:7 and in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach</i> 5:7 and 5:9, he forbids the use of stolen articles for the performance of a commandment. In addition, he has not yet mentioned the halachah requiring one to own the lulav used on the first day.</p>
<p>The <i>Taz</i> (649:15) clarifies the matter slightly further by explaining that since taking the lulav on the second day is only a Rabbinic commandment, using a stolen lulav is allowed even though it is a מצוה הבאה בעבירה.]"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.9",and on the other days -," <i>Chol Hamo'ed</i>, when all opinions agree that..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.9",Those which are disqualified because of the association with idol worship -, mentioned in Halachah 1
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10",On the first day of the festival -," It appears from the Rambam's statements that even in Jerusalem, where Torah law requires that the mitzvah be fulfilled for all seven days of the festival, the obligation to own the lulav applies only on the first day."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10",unless the latter gives it to him as a present. -," Though there are certain restrictions against the transfer of property on a holiday, it is permitted to give a colleague a present (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 3:11)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10","that he return it, he may fulfill his obligation with it and return it -"," There are authorities who require that the owner specifically state that he is giving the lulav to his colleague on the condition that the latter return it. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 658:5) states that even if the owner gives a colleague a lulav without making such a statement, it is assumed that the lulav was given subject to this condition."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10","If he does not return it, he does not fulfill his obligation, because it is as though it were stolen. -"," i.e., by failing to fulfill the condition under which the present was given, the recipient nullifies the legal transfer of ownership. Thus, although he was in physical possession of the article, it did not belong to him. Hence, it is considered to be stolen and, thus, not eligible to be used for the mitzvah (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10",a lulav should not be given to a minor -," The definition of the term ""minor"" in this context has been the subject of debate among the Rabbis. From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he includes all minors in this category. However, Rabbenu Nissim writes that a child of six or seven can transfer property and, hence, his return of the lulav is valid.</p>
<p>Support for Rabbenu Nissim's position is brought from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:10), which relates that Rav Nachman bar Ya'akov gave his etrog as a present to his son and told him: ""When you take possession of it and fulfill the mitzvah, return it to me."" Nevertheless, the passage does not serve as conclusive proof, because the possibility exists that his son had already reached majority. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 6) follows the Rambam's view."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10",but cannot transfer them to others. -," The transfer of the ownership of an article requires a conscious decision. Torah law maintains that a child lacks intellectual maturity (דעת), and thus is incapable of making such a decision."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10",The above applies to the lulav and to each of the other species of the four taken with it. -," The verse quoted above includes all the four species, and not only the lulav. Therefore..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.11","When partners purchase a lulav or etrog together, neither is -"," considered to be the owner of the species in its entirety. Therefore, neither is..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.11",unless his colleague gives him his portion as a present. -," The principles mentioned in the previous halachah regarding giving a lulav as a present also apply to giving a share of it as a present.</p>
<p>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions a very frequent application of this concept: a lulav and etrog purchased by a synagogue for the use of all of its members. He quotes the Rashba, who explains that since the etrog was purchased with the intent that it be used by each member of that community, implicit in their agreement is that, on the first day, it will belong to each individual entirely at the time he uses it to fulfill the mitzvah.</p>
<p>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 648:7) quotes this statement as halachah. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 648:10 raises questions concerning it and suggests that each member of the community should grant his colleague his share as a present."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.11","If one of them takes an etrog with the intent of fulfilling his obligation, [the following rules apply:] If he could eat it without the other brothers objecting -"," it is considered to be his own. Hence,..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.11",he does not fulfill his obligation until they give him their share [in the etrog] as a present.,"</p>
<p>The above principles apply only when the funds of the estate were used to purchase a number of etrogim. Since many fruits of the same species were purchased with the money from the estate, it is possible that the other brothers will not object to one brother's taking an etrog for his own use. However, if the money of the estate was used to buy a number of different species of fruit - e.g.,..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.12",Even though it is a mitzvah to rejoice on all the festivals -," as <a href=""/9980#v14"">Deuteronomy 16:14</a> teaches: ""And you shall rejoice on your festivals."" Though that verse is mentioned with regard to Sukkot, <a href=""/9980#v11"">Deuteronomy 16:11</a> states with regard to Shavuot: ""and you shall rejoice before God,"" and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4b explains that an analogy is established to include Pesach as well."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.12","as [<a href=""/9924#v40"">Leviticus 23:40</a>] commands: ""And you shall rejoice",
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.12","for seven days."" -"," Although this verse is used to derive the requirement of taking the lulav in Jerusalem for each of the seven days of the festival (Chapter 7, Halachah 13), its simple meaning remains.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this charge is not considered to be an independent commandment, but rather an extension (and an intensification) of the mitzvah of celebrating on the festivals. Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes ""to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>.""</p>
<p>This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another. For this reason, weddings are not held during the festivals so that the wedding celebrations should not clash with those of the festival.</p>
<p>Thus, were one to consider the celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> as associated with the water offering, one might ask why the Sages instituted such a celebration which might appear to overshadow the celebration of the festival itself. However, the above explanation resolves this difficulty as well, for as stated above, the <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> celebration is an extension of the festival celebrations and not an independent matter. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, ibid.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.12",they would set up a place in the Temple -," in the open courtyard before the entrance to the Temple courtyard proper. This was called <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> - the women's courtyard - because in contrast to the Temple courtyard, women were allowed to enter the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> even when they were not offering sacrifices. The Rambam describes the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> in <i>Hilchot Beit Habechirah</i> 5:7."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.12",The celebration would begin on the night after the first day of the festival. -," Since, as explained in the following halachah, the celebration was not held on the first night of the festival."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.13",What was the nature of this celebration? -," The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1-2) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever has not seen <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> has never seen rejoicing in his life!...</p>
<p>There were golden candelabras....There was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illuminated with the light of <i>Beit Hasho'evah</i>.</p>
<p>The pious and men of stature would dance before them with torches of fire in their hands and recite songs of praise. The Levites would play the harps, lutes, cymbals, and all other types of instruments on the steps...leading down from the Israelites' courtyard."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.13","and songs played on the harp, lute, and cymbals. [In addition,] each person would play on the instrument which he knew. Those who could sing, would sing. -", See the quote from the Mishnah above.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.14",It is a great mitzvah to maximize this celebration -," for the experience of genuine Torah happiness is a fundamental and necessary element of our service of God, as explained in the following halachah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.14","only the greatest of Israel's wise men: the Rashei Yeshivot, the members of the high court, the pious, the elders, and the men of stature. -", for it was only their celebration that could inspire the people with spiritual feeling.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.15",The happiness with which a person should rejoice in the fulfillment of the mitzvot and the love of God who commanded them is a great service. -," By mentioning this concept at the conclusion - but as part - of the these halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the celebration of the festivals is not just an isolated experience, but rather is intended to influence the totality of our service of God. The rejoicing of the festival of Sukkot enables us to appreciate true happiness in all aspects of our Torah service."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.15","Whoever holds himself proud, giving himself honor, and acts haughtily in such situations is a sinner and a fool -"," for he is concerned with himself, rather than with God."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.15","[In contrast,] anyone who lowers himself and thinks lightly of his person in these situations -"," transcending his self-consciousness and committing himself to God totally, without any restrictions"

Fasts 3.1,[We should adhere to the following procedure when] no rain at all has descended from the beginning of the rainy season onward: -," <i>Ta'anit</i> 6a relates that the rainy season in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> begins in the month of Marcheshvan. The third of the month is considered to be the earliest time rain can be expected to descend.</p>
<p>In other lands, such fasts should be held when, ע""ל, they are necessary according to the local needs and climate (Halachah 10; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575:9)."
Fasts 3.1,the Torah scholars should begin to fast -," and repent. Nevertheless, the situation is not serious enough to alarm the people at large."
Fasts 3.1,"[and continuing on] the [following] Thursday, and the [following] Monday. -"," These fasts begin at dawn; work, anointing oneself, wearing shoes, and sexual relations are permitted.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:1) emphasizes that these fasts are considered individual fasts and not communal fasts."
Fasts 3.2,If Rosh Chodesh Kislev arrives without the rains having descended -, The drought is considered serious enough to warrant that
Fasts 3.2,"[and continuing on] the [following] Thursday, and the [following] Monday. -"," As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 5, when necessary the court ordains a series of three fasts to evoke Divine favor."
Fasts 3.2,The men serving in the [weekly] priestly watch -," See <i>Hilchot Klei Hamikdash</i> 3:9, which states that the prophet Samuel and King David ordained 24 priestly watches, which rotated in the Temple service. Each week, a different watch would serve."
Fasts 3.2,"On these days, the entire people should enter the synagogue, pray, cry out [to God] -"," i.e., the prayer <i>Anenu</i> is recited in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and other supplicatory prayers are recited."
Fasts 3.3,If these [fasts] pass without [their prayers] being answered -," By choosing this wording (quoted from <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:6), the Rambam teaches us a lesson in the service of God. It could have said, ""If these fasts pass without rain having descended."" The Rambam and the Mishnah, however, want to emphasize that the ultimate reason why rain descends or does not descend is not dependent on natural factors, but rather on God's mercies."
Fasts 3.3,"On these fasts, we eat and drink while it is still day [on the day before the fast], as on the fast of Yom Kippur. -"," I.e., as on Yom Kippur, we are forbidden to eat and drink after sunset. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 575:2, however, explains that unlike Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Esor</i> 1:6), there is no obligation to begin the fast before sunset."
Fasts 3.3,but should not complete the fast -, lest they become weak and be unable to serve in the Temple when called.
Fasts 3.3,"On a fast for which we are required to cease eating while it is still day, once a person has ceased eating -", concluded his meal
Fasts 3.4,"On these three fasts, all people are forbidden -"," As the Rambam mentions in Chapter 1, Halachah 4, all the fasts mentioned in this text are Rabbinic in origin. The only fast mentioned in the Torah is Yom Kippur. Accordingly, when the Sages instituted communal fasts, they used Yom Kippur as a paradigm. Therefore, just as it is forbidden to perform work, wash, anoint oneself, engage in sexual relations, or wear shoes on that holy day, these activities were also forbidden on other fast days.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on fast days other than Yom Kippur, certain leniencies were instituted, and these restrictions were not enforced to the same degree as on Yom Kippur."
Fasts 3.4,but they are permitted during the [previous] night. -," <i>Ta'anit, ibid.</i>, continues using exegesis to show that, in contrast to Shavuot, working on the night of a fast day is permitted."
Fasts 3.4,"but one may wash one's face, hands, and feet -", even in hot water (<i>loc. cit.</i>).
Fasts 3.4,It is forbidden to anoint oneself -, for the sake of pleasure.
Fasts 3.4,Sexual relations are forbidden -, This applies even on the night of a woman's ritual immersion (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:8).
Fasts 3.4,We pray in the synagogues -," As opposed to the following sequence of fasts, whose prayer services are held in the streets of the city, as explained in Chapter 4."
Fasts 3.7,There are additional dimensions [of severity] to these [fasts] -, The first four points mentioned in this halachah are described at length in Chapter 4.
Fasts 3.7,pray in the street of the city -," See Chapter 4, Halachah 1"
Fasts 3.7,add six blessings in the morning -," See Chapter 4, Halachot 7-14"
Fasts 3.7,"thus, we recite twenty-four blessings -"," More precisely 25. The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2), which refers to the era before the nineteenth blessing was added to the daily <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2:1.)"
Fasts 3.7,"On Mondays, the doors of the stores -"," From the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:4), the Ramah, and other commentaries, it appears that the leniencies mentioned here refer only to stores that sell food, but not those that carry other merchandise."
Fasts 3.7,and they may be opened [for business] -," to allow people to purchase food for the evening meal. There are, however, certain restrictions; for example, the products in the store may not be taken out to the store's display area (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:6)."
Fasts 3.7,"If a store has two entrances, one entrance should be opened and the other closed. -"," From the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it appears that this restriction applies on Mondays as well as on Thursdays."
Fasts 3.8,If these [fasts] pass without [their prayers] being answered -," no other communal fasts are ordained, as explained in the following halachah. The fact that no other fasts are called does not mean that the community may return to their ordinary pattern of conduct. Quite the contrary: the period is regarded as one of Divine disfavor. Hence,"
Fasts 3.8,"construction projects associated with joy - e.g., those involving decorative patterns on the ceilings and walls -"," In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 1:7), the Rambam states that this refers to ornate buildings erected by the wealthy. There is, however, no restriction on ordinary building projects necessary for one's everyday purposes.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:7) describes the prohibition as applying to ""buildings of joy."" The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:18 (based on the <i>Tur</i>) explains that this refers to all buildings that are unnecessary and are constructed for beauty and comfort."
Fasts 3.8,"associated with joy - e.g., that of myrtle trees -"," In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that this refers to spice and flower gardens planted for pleasure. One may, however, plant orchards for the purpose of growing fruit. There are no restrictions on such activity."
Fasts 3.8,We also minimize betrothals and marriages -, The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575) interprets this to mean that a person who has fulfilled the mitzvah of fathering children should not become betrothed or marry at all.
Fasts 3.8,Whoever has fulfilled this mitzvah is forbidden to engage in sexual relations in a year of famine. -," <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a derives this concept from <a href=""/8236#v50"">Genesis 41:50</a>, which states that Joseph's children were born before the famine. One can infer that during the famine he did not engage in relations.</p>
<p>This restriction was instituted because it is proper to reduce our indulgence in pleasure in a time of communal distress."
Fasts 3.8,"Rather, [they should conduct themselves as people] who have been rebuffed and ostracized by God. -"," A person under a ban of ostracism is forbidden to greet others or to return greetings. Hence the above prohibition.</p>
<p><i>Ta'anit</i> 14b states that it is proper to cover one's head with a cloak as mourners do. Nevertheless, neither the Rambam nor the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes this obligation (perhaps because even mourners did not generally observe this custom after the Talmudic era)."
Fasts 3.9,The Torah scholars alone continue to fast -," The commentaries do not mention whether it is preferable that all the students of the Torah join in these fasts, as was stated in Halachah 1. One might presume, however, that they should. Indeed, the entire community should have been required to observe these fasts, and it is only because the Rabbis thought that this would be too difficult for them that they were released from this obligation."
Fasts 3.9,[in this manner] until the month of Nisan -," <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:7 states that these fasts should continue ""until Nisan passes."" In the Jerusalem Talmud's explanation of this Mishnah, it is explained that this refers to Nisan"
Fasts 3.9,"passes. This is not, however, required of the community. No more than these thirteen communal fasts are decreed because of a lack of rainfall. -"," <i>Ta'anit</i> 14b considered thirteen fasts as the maximum a community should be required to undertake for this reason. More fasts would be considered an excessive burden. (Significantly, according to Kabbalah, the number thirteen is identified with God's attributes of mercy.)</p>
<p>As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4, this limit applies only regarding fasts decreed because of a lack of rain. When communal fasts are decreed because of other distressing circumstances, we should continue fasting until our prayers are answered."
Fasts 3.9,"and are allowed to perform work, to wash, to anoint themselves, to engage in sexual relations, and to wear shoes as on other fast days. -"," These restrictions apply only on Yom Kippur, Tish'ah B'Av, and the latter ten fasts decreed because of a lack of rain."
Fasts 3.9,"After the month of Nisan, as determined in relation to the spring season, passes - i.e. -", one month after the spring season begins
Fasts 3.9,of the bull -, This is at the beginning of the secular month of May.

Human Dispositions 6.1,so as to learn from their deeds. -," In Halachah 2, the Rambam states that it is a mitzvah to associate with the righteous, while here he describes the need for such association as morally compelling. Note our commentary to that halachah."
Human Dispositions 6.1,"This is [implied by] Solomon's statement (<a href=""/16384#v20"">Proverbs 13:20)</a>: ""He who walks with the wise will become wise, -"," <i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezar</i> (Chapter 25) explains this verse with an analogy of a person who spends time in a perfumery.

Human Dispositions 6.1,"Similarly, [<a href=""/16222#v1"">Psalms 1:1</a>] states: ""Happy is the man who has not followed the advice of the wicked."" -"," The verse from Proverbs supports the previously stated concept that a person is influenced by his environment. The verse from Psalms introduces the concept which follows; that bad company should be avoided.</p>
<p>A person who lives in a place where the norms of behavior are evil and the inhabitants do not follow the straight path should move to a place where the people are righteous - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXIII, states that this restriction does not apply to a person who settles in a community for the expressed purpose of spreading Torah. He need not worry about being influenced by his surroundings, because, to borrow a concept from <i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Chapter 69, out of context, ""one who is preoccupied with giving will not receive."""
Human Dispositions 6.1,"or if he is unable to move to a place where the patterns of behavior are proper, because of [the presence of] bands of raiding troops, or for health reasons, -"," The Rambam apparently does not suggest risking one's life to make such a move.

<p>In Halachah 1, the Rambam described the association with the wise as a moral imperative and, here, he states that it is a Torah commandment. We saw a similar pattern in Chapter 1. First, he outlined his theory of the middle path of behavior as the optimal moral position. Only afterwards, did he equate it with the commandment to ""walk in His ways.""</p>
<p>This approach demonstrates that the Torah does not impose a Divine Will upon man which he cannot grasp or understand. Rather, it reflects rules and principles that can be conceived by human thought and explained in terms of human nature. Thus, the workings of the Halachah can be seen as having been instituted as an organic part of the makeup of the world at large and man in particular. (See the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 48.)"

<p>Each of the clauses in these two verses is halachically significant. The first verse informs us that hatred of a fellow Jew is prohibited (Halachah 5). Then, it explains how one should respond if negative feelings towards a colleague arise (Halachah 6, here). Afterwards, it teaches that one's negative feelings must be expressed in a manner that does not embarrass one's fellow Jew (Halachah 8). Thus, the verse can be rendered: Do not bear hate in your heart, instead, inform your fellow Jew of your complaint, but do so in a manner that is not sinful. (Note the Ramban's commentary on the verse.)</p>
<p>The second verse teaches that vengeance or bearing a grudge is forbidden (Chapter 7, Halachot 7-8) and then, concludes with a positive statement obligating us to love our fellow Jew (Halachah 3)."

Human Dispositions 6.7,"by his evil deeds as [<a href=""/9920#v17"">Leviticus 19:17</a>] states: ""You shall surely admonish your colleague."" -"," The Torah mentions the mitzvah of admonishment directly after the prohibition against hating a fellow Jew, implying that admonishing is intended as a safeguard to prevent hatred from arising between Jews.</p>
<p>The previous halachah dealt with this concept in terms of our interpersonal relationships. Our halachah deals with this concept within the context of a person's relationship with God. <i>Pesachim</i> 113a teaches we must hate a sinner. As a preventive measure, the Torah offers us an alternative, admonishing him, which hopefully will cause him to correct his behavior and thus, do away with the need for such hatred (<i>Sefer Yeraim</i>).</p>

The same applies concerning similar cases.</p>
<p>Commenting on this law, the Ramah (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that a person should not rebuke a colleague for the inadvertent transgression of a Torah law if he knows that the transgressor will not listen.

Human Dispositions 6.10,A person is obligated to show great care for orphans and widows because their spirits are very low and their feelings are depressed. -," These people tend to be oversensitive and the smallest harshness or slight might cause them pain and thus, constitute a transgression of the prohibition mentioned below."
Human Dispositions 6.10,"as [implied by <a href=""/9883#v21"">Exodus 22:21</a>]: ""Do not mistreat any widow or orphan."" -", <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (neg. mitzvot 256) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 65) consider this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.
Human Dispositions 6.10,"Anyone who vexes or angers them, hurts their feelings, oppresses them, or causes them financial loss transgresses this prohibition. -"," The violation of the prohibition is thus dependent on the feelings of the widow or orphans in question. There is no objective standard of behavior. Rather, one must become sensitive to the feelings of the people who have suffered the loss and conduct himself accordingly."
Human Dispositions 6.10,"Even though [a person who violates] this prohibition is not [liable for] lashes, -"," the minimum punishment given for the transgression of a Torah prohibition.</p>
<p>The commentaries have questioned why, in fact, the minimal punishment of lashes is never given. Though punishment is not given for a transgression that does not involve a deed as mentioned in Halachah 5, it is possible that a person will commit a deed that aggravates a widow or orphan. Why does he not receive lashes in such an instance?</p>
<p>The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> states that since the nature of the prohibition is very subjective, the Torah does not specify any punishment. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> quotes an opinion which maintains that any prohibition that can be violated by speech or thought alone (as is possible in this case) is not liable for lashes even when it is transgressed with a deed. The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that the reason one does not receive lashes is stated by the Rambam himself, namely:"
Human Dispositions 6.10,There is a covenant between them and He who spoke and created the world -," When people lose a loved one, they often despair and feel that the world is run in a random and arbitrary manner. Perhaps the Rambam uses this term for God - ""He who spoke..."" - to stress how He is the One who brought the world into being and controls every facet of its existence."
Human Dispositions 6.10,"Nevertheless, -", even though he is given permission to discipline them
Human Dispositions 6.10,This applies to both those orphaned from their father and those orphaned from their mother. -," This point is also mentioned explicitly in the <i>Mechilta</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The commentaries note only one other source which alludes to this concept, the description of Mar Ukva's children as orphans (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 70a) although other references imply that they had only lost their mother."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.1,A person is forbidden to walk behind a synagogue -," This refers to the side of the synagogue on which there is an entrance. However, a person walking on the other side of the synagogue does not appear to dismiss the idea of prayer, since he has not willfully abstained from entering the place of worship (<i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 90)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.1,unless he is carrying a burden -," Since he is carrying a bundle, it is clearly understood why he is not entering the synagogue.</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 8b quotes the above prohibition in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. It then quotes Abbaye who mentions the various qualifications related by the Rambam."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.1,"Similarly, if there are two synagogues in the city, a person seeing him would say that perhaps he is going to his usual synagogue -", and is not shirking his responsibility to pray.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.2,One praying with a congregation should not lengthen his prayer excessively -," From the passage from <i>Berachot</i> quoted below, it would appear that the prohibition was instituted to prevent the discomfort that would be caused were the congregation to be forced to wait for one individual to finish his prayers. Rav Kapach notes that even if the congregation would not necessarily wait, it is forbidden to do so, lest one appear haughty."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.2,"If, after praying, -"," i.e., after he has completed <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.2,including even the confession of Yom Kippur. -," The Talmud (<i>ibid.</i>) (and, similarly, the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>) states that after prayer, one may add “the order of the day of Yom Kippur” and does not mention וידוי (confession).</p>
<p>One might conclude that this indicates that one may add as much as he likes. The prayers of Yom Kippur are mentioned since they serve as the paradigm of long prayer."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.3,What is implied? -, by the last clause of the previous halachah.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.3,as eloquently as he can. -," Note Chapter 1, Halachah 4, which explains that the reason the Sages established a standard text of prayer was to prevent people from praying in a non-eloquent manner. Though a person is allowed to make whatever additions to prayer he desires, he should try to use the most elegant means of expression as possible."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.3,The same applies regarding each of the other [blessings]. -," For example, Rashi (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) explains that one desiring not to forget that which he has learned should make such a request in חונן הדעת [the first of the intermediate blessings]."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.4,A person is forbidden to taste -, This includes both eating and drinking and indicates that one is forbidden from even tasting the smallest amount of food.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.4,or to do any work -," <i>Berachot</i> 14a relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">A person is forbidden to deal with his personal matters before he prays, as [<a href=""/16306#v14"">Psalms 85:14</a>] states: ""[He will place] righteousness before him and he will place his feet in the path.""</p>
<p>Rashi explains that first one must pay heed to the righteousness of the Creator, and only then walk in the way - i.e., do work that is necessary for his own personal needs."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.4,He should also refrain from visiting the house of a friend to greet him before he has recited the Morning Prayer; -," <i>Berachot</i> 14a relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Anyone who greets his friend before praying has, so to speak, made his friend into an altar, as [<a href=""/15933#v22"">Isaiah 2:22</a>] states: ""Desist from the man whose life is in his nostrils, as for what is he considered."" Do not read <i>bemah</i> (“for what”) but rather <i>bamah</i> (“an altar”).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Talmud explains that this prohibition only applies to going to a friend's house to greet him. Greeting him in the street is permitted."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.4,"However, one may taste food or do work before reciting <i>Musaf</i> or <i>Minchah</i> -"," <i>Berachot</i> 28b quotes two opinions, one of Rav Huna forbidding eating before <i>Musaf</i>, and one of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi forbidding eating before <i>Minchah</i>, but does not accept either of them as binding."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.5,Once the time for <i>Minchah</i> Gedolah arrives -," i.e., six and a half hours (שעות זמניות) of the day, as explained in Chapter 3, Halachah 2."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.5,"even [if only] to sweat, until he has prayed -"," This person is not interested in bathing in the hot or cold bath or washing himself well, which are time-consuming activities. Nevertheless, since a prohibition was instituted against bathing..."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.5,"He should not eat, even a snack, lest he continue eating and neglect prayer -"," In the previous halachah, the Rambam rules that one may taste food before <i>Minchah</i>, but forbade eating a meal. Here, he states that even a snack is forbidden. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that eating a כביצה (the equivalent of an egg, 52 or 100 cubic centimeters, according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and the <i>Chazon Ish</i>, respectively) of fruit, or a כזית (an olive size, approximately 26 or 50 cubic centimeters, according to the same references cited) of bread constitutes <i>achilat ari’ai</i> which we have translated as a snack."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.5,"Similarly, one should not sit in a barber's chair, even for a regular haircut -"," as opposed to the especially intricate haircut given the High Priest, called the haircut of ""ben Elasa"" (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b). (See also <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 5:6)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.5,"He should not enter a tanning house close to <i>Minchah</i> before he has prayed, lest he see a deficiency in his work which he will deal with, and [thereby] be delayed from praying. -"," The Rambam explains, in his commentary on the Mishnah, that if one sees a deficiency in the skin he will attempt to stop further damage, and his involvement in this work could last until after the end of the time for <i>Minchah</i>.</p>
<p>The Rambam's interpretation of the mishnah is not accepted by other authorities. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>) rules that only complicated activities are forbidden and simple acts, e.g., a snack or a normal haircut are permitted.</p>
<p>This disagreement finds expression in the rulings of the later authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) quotes the Rambam's view. The Ramah brings a third opinion (of the <i>Ba'al HaMa'or</i>) which rules that even a large meal is permissible before <i>Minchah Gedolah</i>, and that a snack is permissible even before <i>Minchah K'tanah</i>. He adds that perhaps the reason for this leniency is that since it was customary to call people to synagogue, it is unlikely that they would not forget to go. However, he advises following the more stringent view when praying alone."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6,When is the beginning of a haircut? -," In Halachah 5, the Rambam taught us that if one had already begun his involvement in any of these activities, he need not stop in order to recite <i>Minchah</i>. Therefore, it is necessary to understand what constitutes involvement in these activities."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6,When is the beginning of a bath? -," i.e., when is he considered to be bathing, so that he need not stop to pray?"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6,"When is the beginning of [work in the] tanning house? When he ties the apron between his shoulders, as is the way of artisans. -"," <i>Shabbat</i> 9b states simply: ""When he ties between his shoulders."" In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that it is when he ties his belt in order to work with the skins. Evidently this means the belt around his apron. There is a version of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah which mentions also that he begins working with the skins. This is, however, hard to understand in light of his commentary here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6,"For the inhabitants of Babylonia, it is when they loosen their belts -"," Rashi explains that the custom in Babylonia was to wear their belts particularly tight, necessitating that they be loosened prior to eating. This was not the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions only the halachah of washing one's hands. Since the Mishnah was written in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, its interpretation must be in line with the customs and realities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam focuses on the actual halachah. Hence, he defines the beginning of eating in line with both positions, one relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the other to Babylonia."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.7,Even though the Evening Prayer is not obligatory -," See Chapter 1, Halachah 6 and the commentary there."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.8,A person who is involved in the study of Torah when the time for prayer arrives must stop and pray -," The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) states that one must stop for <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but not for prayer. The Talmud (11a) explains that this refers to one involved in the study of Torah."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.8,"and he is involved in the study of Torah at the time of prayer, he need not stop, since the commandment of the study of Torah is greater than the commandment of prayer -"," In <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:3, the Rambam states: ""There is no commandment among all the commandments that is equal to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah is equal to all the other commandments, since study brings one to action. Therefore, study comes before action at all times.""</p>
<p>A person involved in Torah study achieves a level of unity with God that is unparalleled by any other activity. One's intellect and God's wisdom become inextricably linked, until they are indistinguishable during the moments of one's actual involvement in study. On this basis, we can understand the description of Torah with the metaphor of bread (<a href=""/16380#v5"">Proverbs 9:5</a>, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13). After bread is consumed by a person, it becomes assimilated into his blood and becomes part of the person himself. Similarly, when Torah is studied, it becomes absorbed into the person's character and becomes an integral part of his being (<i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 5).</p>
<p>As explained in the introduction to this text, prayer focuses on our attempt to relate to the Godliness that permeates our worldly existence. Though this is an extremely significant service, the connection established through Torah study is more complete. Thus, <i>Shabbat</i> 10a records how Ravvah rebuked Rav Hamnuna for neglecting his Torah studies to prolong his prayers. By doing he was ""abandoning eternal life for transcient life."" Therefore, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues whose commitment to Torah was all encompassing were not required to interrupt their studies for prayer."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.9,One is forbidden to interrupt his Amidah except in a situation where his life is endangered -," In <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:15-17, we discussed the various situations in which one is allowed to interrupt his recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. Here, the Rambam teaches that the laws regarding the <i>Amidah</i> are much more strict. Only a threat to one's very life is considered sufficient cause to interrupt the <i>Amidah</i>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.9,"However, he may interrupt [and answer] a non-Jewish king, lest he -", fail to understand the concept explained above and...
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.9,A person standing in the [midst of the] Amidah who sees a non-Jewish king or tyrant approaching him should shorten [his prayer]. -," Rabbenu Yonah explains that this means simply to recite the beginning and end of each blessing. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also agrees with this explanation.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Halachot 2-3, the Rambam mentions the text for a shortened prayer. However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between this opinion and that law."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.10,"Women, slaves and children are obligated to pray -"," This is based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 20a-b). This halachah is discussed in Chapter 1, Halachah 2."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.1",Where are the head <i>tefillin</i> placed? -," Though all four Biblical passages state that the <i>tefillin</i> should be worn ""between your eyes,"" <i>Menachot</i> 37b establishes a correlation between these verses and <a href=""/9978#v1"">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>, ""Do not place a bald spot between your eyes,"" and explains that, just as in the latter verse, ""between your eyes"" refers to the skull, so, too, the verses which concern <i>tefillin</i> imply a place on the skull."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.1",the place where a child's brain [can be felt] to pulsate. -," Our translation is based on the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. Instead of ""pulsate,"" Rashi (<i>Menachot</i> 37a) interprets רופס as ""is soft."""
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.1",so that they will be -, parallel to the place
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.1",The knot -," mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 13"
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.2","The arm [<i>tefillin</i>] should be tied to one's left arm -<i>Menachot</i> 37a brings a number of exegetical references which indicate that <i>tefillin</i> should be placed on the left arm. Among them, ""It is written, 'And you shall tie' and 'And you should write.' Just as writing is done with the right hand, so, too, tying should be done with the right hand."" Tying <i>tefillin</i> with one's right hand implies that they are placed on the left.",
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.2","i.e., the bulging flesh of the arm between the shoulder and the elbow. -"," <i>Menachot</i> 37b explains that though the verse literally states that <i>tefillin</i> should be placed on the hand, the exegesis of several verses indicates that they are placed on the muscle. The interpretation of the verse, ""And these words..."" quoted by the Rambam is one of the proofs cited there."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.3",A person who places the arm <i>tefillah</i> on his palm -," in contrast to our Sages' definition of the phrase, ""on your hand"""
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.3",follows the way of the Sadducees. -," In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 1:3, the Rambam writes that Tzadok and Baithos were students of Antigonus of Socho. When they heard their teacher declare, ""Do not serve the master for the sake of receiving a reward,"" they were upset, since they thought that he was implying that no reward would be given for the performance of mitzvot. They spoke about the matter between themselves and decided to reject the Torah.</p>
<p>They began splinter groups which rejected the core of Jewish practice, and coveted material wealth. They found that they could not convince the majority of the people to reject the Torah entirely, so they adopted a different tactic. They claimed that they were true to Torah, but the only Torah that was Divine was the Written Law. The Oral Law was merely a human invention.</p>
<p>This thesis was only a ruse to sway the people from the performance of the mitzvot. Accordingly, the Sages would frequently refer to all those who deny the Torah and its tradition to be Sadducees (""followers of Tzadok"") or Baithosees (""followers of Baithos"")."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.3",does not fulfill the mitzvah at all -," because, as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 1, <i>tefillin</i> must be square."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.3","If he is ambidextrous, he should place them on his left hand - i.e., his left hand in a literal sense. -"," Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 27:6), who explains that everything depends on the hand with which the person writes. If he writes with his left hand, the <i>tefillin</i> should be placed on the right.</p>
<p>Rav Shlomo Kluger, the <i>Tzemach Tzedek</i>, and other later authorities have dealt with questions concerning people who are ambidextrous to varying degrees. Frequently, they have advised that such a person wear <i>tefillin</i> on one of his arms during the prayer service, and afterwards place them on the other arm, to make sure that he fulfills the mitzvah."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.4",The [absence of the] head <i>tefillah</i> does not preclude [wearing <i>tefillin</i>] on the arm -," i.e., if a person does not have a head <i>tefillah</i> or is in a situation where it is inappropriate to wear the head <i>tefillah</i> (see Halachah 23), he should still wear the arm <i>tefillah</i>"
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.4",does not preclude [wearing <i>tefillin</i>] on the head. -," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions a version of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 4:1) which differs with this ruling. Rav Kapach explains that he is referring to the initial version of the Commentary on the Mishnah, which the Rambam later revised.</p>
<p>In that initial version, the Rambam explains (based on <i>Menachot</i> 44a) that the Sages feared that if a person were given license to wear only one <i>tefillah</i>, he might hesitate from purchasing the other one. Therefore, they allowed one to wear a single <i>tefillah</i> only when he already possessed the second one. When the Rambam reviewed that commentary, he emended the text to concur with the decision here."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.4","What blessings are recited? On the head <i>tefillin</i>, one recites: -"," See the following halachah, where the Rambam explains that, generally, it is proper to recite only a single blessing."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.5",When does the above apply? When one puts on only one of them. -," As mentioned in the previous halachah, at times one can put one on without the other. On such occasions, the appropriate blessing should be recited for each <i>tefillah</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.5","one recites only a single blessing, ""...to put on <i>tefillin</i>."" -"," This phrase can also refer to putting on the head <i>tefillin</i>, since both mitzvot share the same intent. Hence, if no interruption is made between the two, it is unnecessary - and therefore, we are forbidden - to recite a second blessing.</p>
<p>This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:5) and is followed by all Sephardic authorities and some Ashkenazic authorities. The majority of the Ashkenazic community follows the opinion of Rabbenu Asher (quoted by the Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) which maintains that the two blessings should be recited even when no interruption is made between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>.</p>
<p>This opinion agrees that the blessing ""...to put on <i>tefillin</i>"" also applies to the head <i>tefillin</i>. Therefore, even according to this opinion, it is forbidden to make an interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>; nevertheless, the Sages instituted a second blessing in recognition of the unique importance and holiness of the head <i>tefillin</i>.</p>
<p>The later authorities have added that because of the possibility that the second blessing is being recited in vain, one should recite the phrase <i>Baruch shem kavod malchuto le'olam va'ed</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.5","and afterwards, put on the head <i>tefillin</i> -", following the order stated in the Biblical commandment (<i>Menachot</i> 36a).
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.6","[After] reciting the blessing, ""...to put on <i>tefillin</i>,"" and tying the <i>tefillin</i> on one's arm, one is forbidden to talk -"," for doing so would constitute an interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>. Other interruptions - e.g., to signal to a colleague or to wink at him - are also forbidden. They do not, however, require a second blessing."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.6","until he puts on the head <i>tefillin</i>.

<p>Based on <a href=""/9984#v8"">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>, the Sages explained that the Jewish army should be composed only of righteous men. Any sinners were excused from military service. Significantly, there are opinions which consider this transgression significant enough for a person to be included in this category (<i>Sotah</i> 44b)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.7",Whenever a person puts on <i>tefillin</i> -," This halachah may be difficult for many people to comprehend, because they associate wearing <i>tefillin</i> with the prayer service alone. In truth, as explained in Halachot 10, 25, and 26, the mitzvah of <i>tefillin</i> applies throughout the entire day, and the restriction of wearing them only during the prayer service is a relatively recent development."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.7",he should recite a blessing for them. -," The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:12) states that if a person removes his <i>tefillin</i> with the intent of putting them on again in the near future, it is not necessary for him to recite a blessing."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.7","Therefore, one should recite the blessing for the arm <i>tefillah</i> after placing it on one's muscle -"," and not beforehand, so that the blessing is recited directly before the mitzvah is fulfilled (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.8","Thus, he will [be forced to] ignore it and take out the arm <i>tefillah</i>, since one should not put on the head <i>tefillah</i> before the arm <i>tefillah</i> -", as explained in Halachah 5.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.1",A sukkah which -, does not meet the above requirements and

The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 1:1) explains that their difference of opinion is based on the exegesis of <a href=""/15935#v6"">Isaiah 4:6</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be a sukkah that will serve as a shadow from the heat during the day, a place of refuge, and a cover from storm and from rain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sages maintain that the verse refers to three different activities, and hence require three walls. Rabbi Shimeon counts ""a cover from storm and from rain"" as two different activities, and hence requires four walls."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.2","perpendicular to each other in the shape of [the Greek letter], gamma -"," Rabbenu Manoach notes that a <i>gamma</i> has the same shape as the Hebrew letter <i>dalet</i> (see accompanying drawing) and asks why the Sages did not use that letter to refer to the intended shape.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.2",of one of the two walls. -," See the accompanying diagram.</p>
<p>The Rabbis have posed an abstract question: Is the minimum requirement for a sukkah three walls (including one which is incomplete), or must a sukkah have four walls, however, the Torah was lenient enough to consider a sukkah of this nature as comparable to one of four walls.</p>
<p>The <i>Marcheshet</i> brings support for the latter view, quoting <i>Sukkah</i> 7b, which states that since the third wall only a handbreadth in size is considered to be a wall with regard to the laws of sukkah, it is also considered to be a wall with regard to the laws regarding a private domain on the Sabbath. In the latter instance, four walls are necessary."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.2",since it -, the sukkah

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.3","However, it is necessary to construct ""the likeness of an entrance"" -"," between the wall of four handbreadths and the wall further removed from it.</p>
<p>This opinion is not universally accepted; and some authorities do not require a ""likeness of an entrance"" for such a sukkah. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 630:3) quotes the Rambam's opinion as halachah.</p>
<p>The Ramah mentions that the ""likeness of an entrance"" is required only when the third wall needs the principle of <i>l'vud</i> for it to be considered seven handbreadths long. However, if the wall is actually seven handbreadths or more long, nothing more is necessary."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.4",Walls -, at least seven handbreadths high
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.4","If they are more than three handbreadths above the earth, they are invalid -"," <i>Sukkah</i> 16a records a difference of opinion between the Sages whether a ""hanging partition"" - i.e., a partition that is not connected to the earth - is kosher. The halachah does not accept such a partition, because animals can crawl under it. (See <i>Shabbat</i> 97a.) Nevertheless..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.4",they are kosher -," Because of the principle of <i>l'vud</i>, it is considered as if they actually reach the ground."

That issue is dealt with in Chapter 5, Halachah 12. Rabbenu Manoach and others have also raised questions whether the <i>s'chach</i> should be supported by the trees. (See the commentary on the following halachah.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.5",a) they are strong enough -, by nature
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.5",and b) he filled [the space] between the branches -," this translation of the word אמיר is taken from <a href=""/15948#v6"">Isaiah 17:6</a>."

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.5","[This is necessary,] for any partition that cannot stand before a normal -"," However, a sukkah's inability to stand before a hurricane wind does not invalidate it."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.6",If a person constructs his sukkah on top of a wagon -," although the wagon moves and is not fixed in one place (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 22b)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.6","it is kosher, and one may ascend to it on the festival. -"," i.e., on the first day of Sukkot in Eretz Yisrael and on the first and second days in the diaspora."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.6",but one may not ascend to it on the festival -," Surely, this prohibition also applies on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>From the Rambam's words, it appears that the restriction applies when the floor of the sukkah is actually in the tree. In contrast, Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 154b), <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 22b and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explain that even if the sukkah is on the ground and only the <i>s'chach</i> is supported by the tree, it is forbidden to use such a sukkah on the festival, lest one place utensils on the <i>s'chach</i>, and thus make use of the tree.</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (628:6) quotes this opinion, but states that at present it is no longer customary to place articles on the <i>s'chach</i>. Therefore, it is permitted to use such a sukkah. His opinion is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 628:7, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 628:17, with one qualification. At the outset, it is desirable not to use an article as support for <i>s'chach</i> unless it is, itself, fit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>. Hence, since the trees themselves are not fit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>, they should not be used as its supports."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.7",A sukkah that does not possess a roof is invalid -, because a dwelling even of a temporary nature must have a roof.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.7","alternatively, when the side of the sukkah is placed against the wall. -", See Diagram B.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.7","has a roof, even only a handbreadth in width -"," between the two walls, as depicted in Diagram C. As long as it has a roof at least a handbreadth wide, the remainder of the roof may be slanted."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.7",it is kosher. - for the fact that the roof is slanted does not disqualify the sukkah.,"</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Manoach, and others explain that though leniency is taken and such a sukkah is allowed, it must still possess all the dimensions required of a kosher sukkah mentioned in Halachah 1 of this chapter. Accordingly, at least six handbreadths of the slanted roof must itself be kosher for use as <i>s'chach</i>, and it must be more than 16 handbreadths long, so that it will be of the required height. When the Sukkah meets these qualifications, one is permitted to eat and sleep within it. (See also Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 631:10.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.8",Should one place s'chach over an exedrah -," A structure frequently employed in Roman architecture, and which was quite common in Jewish homes as well. There were a number of possible forms of this structure. Our halachah (in contrast to <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:35) deals with the following structure: A roof is placed between two walls, and within this roof a hollow place is left to allow sunlight to enter. Pillars are placed at each of the corners of the hole. The question is whether such a structure can serve as a sukkah if one placed <i>s'chach</i> over the hole. See diagram A."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.8","it is kosher, -"," Because of the projections, the opening of the ceiling is considered to be a third wall extending over the entire width of the <i>exedrah</i> and reaching the ground (<i>Sukkah</i> 18b) Thus, greater leniency is granted in this instance than in Halachah 3 of this chapter, where a partition four handbreadths in width is required.</p>
<p>Needless to say, as evident from Halachah 5:14, the walls of the <i>exedrah</i> cannot be more than four cubits removed from the <i>s'chach</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.9",If it -, the sukkah constructed in the <i>exedrah</i>
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.9","it is not valid, because it resembles a sukkah constructed in an alley -", which is described in Halachah 3.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.10",Should a person place s'chach over an alleyway which possesses a lechi -," <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:2 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is one permitted [to carry articles] in a closed alleyway?</p>
<p>One constructs a <i>lechi</i> (vertical pole) [at the entrance] to the fourth side or one lays a beam (<i>korah</i>) across [the span of the fourth side].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach explains that although the alleyway is closed on three sides, were it not for the special provisions mentioned in this halachah, it would not be acceptable, because in this instance the <i>s'chach</i> is placed more than four cubits away from the end of the alleyway. Hence, generally, as explained in Chapter 5, Halachah 14, such a sukkah would not be acceptable."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.10",it is considered a kosher sukkah only on the Sabbath of the festival -," The <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains this as applying only to the days which precede the Sabbath. However, once the sukkah is acceptable on the Sabbath, it is also deemed kosher for the remaining days of the festival. (This view is not accepted by other authorities.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.11",Should a person implant four poles in the four corners of the roof and place s'chach upon them -, See the accompanying diagram.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.12",A sukkah which has many entrances and many windows in its walls is kosher even though the open portion -," Any open portion less than three handbreadths in length is considered to be closed, based on the principle of <i>l'vud</i> (<i>Hilchot Shabbat 16:17). The Magen Avraham</i> 630:1 explains that regarding the laws of sukkah, this principle applies only when one constructs four walls. However, if the sukkah has only three walls, the principle of <i>l'vud</i> cannot be applied, to consider spaces less than three handbreadths in length to be closed."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.13",A sukkah whose inner space -, the space between the ground and the <i>s'chach</i>.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.13",[This applies even if] one considered them a permanent -," The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets ""permanent"" literally. However, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 633:11 explains that according to one opinion, the definition of ""permanence"" is for the duration of the Sukkot holiday. (See also Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 358:2.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.13","If one reduced the space using straw and considered it to be a permanent part of the sukkah, [the space] is considered to be reduced. -"," However, if one laid straw on the floor of the sukkah without having such an intention, the space is not considered to be reduced (ibid.). In his commentary on <i>Ohalot</i> 15:6, the Rambam writes: ""In general, one will have in mind to remove straw.""</p>
<p>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 633:13 emphasizes that one should not reduce the space of the sukkah on the first day of the festival because of the holiday prohibitions. (See also Rabbenu Manoach.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.13",If it -, the inner space of a sukkah
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.13","but branches [from the s'chach descend within the twenty cubits, [the following principle applies:] If its shade would be greater than its open portion -", this is the minimum measure required by the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 1:1) for <i>s'chach</i> to be kosher.

<p>According to the <i>Or Sameach</i>, who maintains that a gentile cannot cause property belonging to a Jew to become forbidden, this law can be explained as follows: Although the gentile's actions would not generally cause the brick to become forbidden, since the Jew indicated his desire to worship the brick, we assume that he is pleased with the gentile's act. Therefore, it becomes forbidden.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Beit Yosef's</i> opinion (see <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145), which maintains that a gentile can cause a Jew's property to become forbidden, this passage teaches us that the Jew's act is considered sufficient to cause the brick to become forbidden."

Because the question is left unresolved, the Rambam follows the more severe view.</p>
<p>This and the previous law indicate that for a Jew's acceptance of idol worship to be significant in this context, it is necessary for him to perform a deed; a verbal statement or thought is of no consequence."

<p>Perhaps, since the prohibition against benefiting from the coating of an idol is considered to be a mitzvah in its own right, the Rambam concludes his discussion of the mitzvah to destroy prohibited articles before entering that subject (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>)."

<p><i>Avodat HaMelech</i> explains that since the concept is derived from a Biblical proof-text, there is no difficulty. It is all a matter of Divine decree. In one instance, God desires that the false deities be destroyed, while in another instance He desires that they be entombed.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a false deity - Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:2) distinguishes between a false deity itself and its accessories and adornments, stating that the latter may be nullified by a gentile even after they have been acquired by a Jew."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.9,and it is forbidden to benefit from it forever. -," Therefore, whenever a Jew wants to take possession of a false deity, he must have it nullified by a gentile before he assumes ownership of it.</p>
<p>A Jew cannot nullify a false deity - An idol can be nullified as a divinity only by a person who once attached importance to it. Since a Jew is, in essence, a believer in the true God, his attachment to idols is merely superficial. Hence, his acts can have no effect upon them."

Afterwards, he met a gentile adult and asked him to nullify it. He refused. Rabbi Elazar struck him and he nullified it.<br/>
We learn from this three things: a) a gentile can nullify an idol whether it belongs to him or to his colleague; b) a gentile who is knowledgeable about idol worship can nullify it, while one who is not knowledgeable cannot nullify it; c) a gentile's nullification of idol worship is effective even if he is compelled to do so.</p>
<p>Neither a minor nor a fool is considered ""knowledgeable about idol worship."" hence, their nullification is not acceptable.</p>
<p>When a gentile is forced to nullify a false deity - whether it belongs to him or to other gentiles - even when he is forced to do so by Jews, the nullification is of consequence.</p>
<p>The gentile who nullifies idol worship must himself be an idolater. - It does not, however, matter whether the idolater worships the particular idol he nullifies or not. For example, a worshiper of Pe'or can nullify a shrine of Marculis (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 64b)."

Torah Study 4.3,If he [desires to] teach through the medium of a spokesman -," There is a difference of opinion between the commentaries regarding the function of this individual. Rashi, <i>Yoma</i> 20b, considers him to be a translator, and, indeed, that is the literal meaning of the term <i>metargaman</i>. In Babylon and even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the popular spoken language was Aramaic, while many of the Sages preferred to teach in Hebrew. Therefore, they would speak to the spokesman in a hushed tone in Hebrew, and he would translate the teachings to Aramaic and teach them to the public in a loud voice.</p>
<p>Others maintain that the spokesman was no more than a ""human microphone."" Rather than have the sage weary himself in speaking in a tone which all could hear, he would speak softly, and the spokesman would speak in a tone that all could hear. This opinion is supported by certain passages (e.g., <i>Kiddushin</i> 31b), which refer to the spokesman as <i>amoriyah</i>, which is the Aramaic for <i>metargaman</i>.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad mentions a third perspective, explaining that the spokesman also communicated the teacher's words in a manner that could be understood and grasped by the students. Rabbi Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch follows a similar, but not identical, view. In <i>Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashanah</i> 5666, he elaborates on this concept in detail, explaining that the teacher was on too high a level to explain his ideas in a manner which the common people could understand. Therefore, he would employ a spokesman, who, though he was able to comprehend the teacher's statements, was on a level that his explanations would not be too sophisticated for the people to grasp. (See also <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 7:12, 9:24.)</p>
<p>The use of a spokesman was also a sign of honor and respect for the teacher. (See Rashi, <a href=""/9996#v44"">Deuteronomy 32:44</a>.)"
Torah Study 4.3,and he announces the teaching to all the students -," in a manner in which they could hear. (See <i>Sotah</i> 40a, <i>Chullin</i> 15a, from which we can derive a picture of the process of instruction.)"
Torah Study 4.3,"The teacher, [in turn,] replies to the spokesman -", in a hushed tone
Torah Study 4.3,The teacher should not raise his voice above that of the spokesman. -," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Berachot</i> 45a, which quotes the manner in which Moses relayed God's words at the giving of the Torah (<a href=""/9880#v19"">Exodus 19:19)</a> as the source for this concept. Nevertheless, others note that the passage in <i>Berachot</i> refers to a <i>metargaman</i> who translates the Torah reading for the people, and is not necessarily relevant to the situation at hand. Rather, they suggest that the descriptions of the use of spokesmen in the passages cited above serve as the source for this idea."
Torah Study 4.3,"The spokesman is not allowed to detract from, add to, or change [the teacher's words] -"," The Rambam's statements are quoted from the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Megillah</i> 4:10. The Ra'avad differs, and quotes a narrative from <i>Yoma</i> 20b, which relates how Rav served as a spokesman for Rav Shilat and altered the connotation of his words. The Ra'avad explains that since Rav's scholarship was greater than Rav Shilat's, he was entitled to do so.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam did not mention such a possibility, because it is very improbable that a greater sage would serve as a spokesman for a sage of lesser stature."
Torah Study 4.3,"If the teacher tells the spokesman: ""My teacher told me the following..."" or ""My father and teacher told me the following...,"" when the spokesman relates the teaching to the people, he should quote the statement in the name of the sage [who authored it] -"," i.e., the teacher's father or teacher"
Torah Study 4.4,"If the teacher taught [a concept] and it was not grasped by the students, he should not become upset with them - In <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 2:3, the Rambam explains in detail how ""anger is a very bad trait, and it is proper for a person to separate himself from it entirely.""","</p>
<p>He continues (<i>ibid.</i> 2:5) explaining how a teacher should instruct the students ""in a composed and pleasant manner, without shouting."" Here, as well, he does not center on the negative aspects of anger in its own right, but rather its impropriety as an educational technique."
Torah Study 4.4,"Rather, he should repeat and review the matter, even if he must do so many times, until they appreciate the depth of the halachah. -"," <a href=""/9995#v19"">Deuteronomy 31:19</a> states that Torah must be placed in a student's mouth. <i>Eruvin</i> 54b interprets this as a charge to teachers, requiring them to review the subject matter with their students until the latter comprehend it fully. The passage continues, praising Rabbi Pereidah for teaching one of his students each point four hundred times.</p>
<p>Though patience is generally required of a teacher, there are times when he should display anger as explained in the following halachah."
Torah Study 4.4,"Rather, he should ask again and again, even if he requires several repetitions. -", The teacher's patient devotion to his students must be reflected by them. They must dedicate themselves to understanding their teacher's words and steadfastly apply themselves to their study until they comprehend.
Torah Study 4.5,A student should not be embarrassed, - and therefore be prevented from asking questions.
Torah Study 4.5,"If he becomes embarrassed because of such matters, he will find himself going in and out of the house of study without learning anything. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 63b teaches: ""Any student who humbles himself because of the words of Torah will ultimately be uplifted."" Rashi explains that this refers to a student who asks all the questions that bother him even though his colleagues look down upon him."
Torah Study 4.5,the Sages of the previous generations stated: - <i>Avot</i> 2:5<br/>,
Torah Study 4.5,When does the above -, the directive that a teacher should patiently repeat his words without displaying anger
Torah Study 4.5,he is obligated to display anger -," This translation is based on <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 2:3, which explains that a person may act in an angry matter to cast fear into the hearts of others. However, he, himself, should not be angry."
Torah Study 4.5,"In this context, our Sages said: -"," <i>Ketubot</i> 103b relates that Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi mentioned this concept in his last will and testament. In particular, this advice was given to his son, Rabban Gamliel, with regard to the manner in which he should conduct himself as a <i>nasi</i>. The Rambam interprets the lesson as more general in nature and applies it to the relationship between every teacher and student."
Torah Study 4.5,Therefore -, in order to cultivate this aura of respect
Torah Study 4.5,"He should not amuse himself in their presence, nor should he eat and drink with them. -"," This does not imply that a teacher must demonstrate a totally stern approach. <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) relates how Rabbah would begin his lectures with a witty statement. His students would laugh and, afterwards, he would sit in awe and begin the lesson."
Torah Study 4.6,"When the teacher enters the house of study, questions should not be posed to him until he gathers his powers of concentration. -"," lest he be prodded into responding hastily, without thinking out the matter in its entirety"
Torah Study 4.6,and rests.<br/>,
Torah Study 4.6,"A teacher should not be asked about an outside matter, but rather, [only] regarding the subject which they -", he and the students
Torah Study 4.6,become embarrassed -," and give an incorrect reply. <i>Shabbat</i> 3b relates that Rabbi Chiyya gave Rav this advice after he asked a question of Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi concerning an unrelated matter.</p>
<p>In the process of instruction..."
Torah Study 4.6,and the deeds he carries out in their presence to sharpen their powers of concentration -," e.g., <i>Chullin</i> 43b relates that Rabbah inspected an animal to see whether it was kosher or not, in a manner which contradicted his own teachings. Here, too, it is explained that his intention was to test his students."
Torah Study 4.7,"A person should not ask a question while standing, nor should a person respond while standing. -"," for a person is more composed when seated. <i>Berachot</i> 27b and <i>Tosafot, B'chorot</i> 36a mention instances when questions were asked while standing. The <i>Beit HaMelech</i> explains that matters which do not require intense thought may be asked while standing, but matters which require concentration should be discussed when both the questioner and the teacher are seated.</p>
<p><i>Avodat HaMelech</i> explains that the Rambam does not intend to imply that the student should not stand. On the contrary, were he to stand, that would be a sign of respect. Rather, he means that questions should not be addressed to a teacher while the latter is standing."
Torah Study 4.7,A question should be asked of the teacher regarding only the subject which they are reading. -," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes the apparent redundancy between this statement and a similar one in the previous halachah, and explains that, in the previous halachah, the Rambam meant that when studying the laws of the Sabbath, a student should not ask his teachers about the laws of the festivals. In this halachah, the Rambam teaches that even within the general subject of the Sabbath laws, while studying the laws of one <i>melachah</i> (forbidden act), a student should not inquire regarding another.</p>
<p>Many of the manuscript versions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state <i>k’inyan</i> (to the point), rather than <i>b’inyan sheheim koreim bo</i> (regarding the subject they are reading). According to these texts, there is no redundancy. Rather, this halachah teaches that a student's questions should be direct, without mentioning any extraneous matters."
Torah Study 4.8,[The following rules apply when] two people ask questions simultaneously: -," A Torah Sage is obligated to answer all questions posed to him, regardless of who the questioner is or what he asks. Thus, this halachah does not rule out a response being given to a particular questioner, but rather establishes the priorities for those responses to be given."
Torah Study 4.8,"and the other is not to the point, attention is paid to the question which is to the point -", because it will be possible to answer in a direct manner.
Torah Study 4.8,"[If one question concerns] Torah law, and the other the interpretation of the verses of the Torah, attention is paid to the question which concerns Torah law. -"," since questions of Torah law, while not necessarily immediately relevant to actual deed, provide guidelines regarding our future behavior. In contrast, the interpretation of Torah verses is a more abstract realm of study, further removed from our immediate behavior."
Torah Study 4.8,attention is paid to the question which concerns the interpretation of the verses of the Torah. -," Though they are somewhat removed from being practical guidelines for behavior, the former are still in the category of halachah - the aspect of Torah study that is related to deed and action. Hence, it is given precedence over <i>aggadah</i>, whose lessons are more personal and require a greater effort to internalize."
Torah Study 4.8,attention is paid to the question which concerns the inference drawn from a minor premise to a major one. -," As above, though the latter subject matter is somewhat removed from being practical guidelines for behavior, it is still in the category of halachah - the aspect of Torah study that is related to deed and action."
Torah Study 4.8,attention is paid to the inference drawn from a minor premise to a major one. -," The <i>Pri Chadash</i> explains that though both of these have equal status, being included as part of the thirteen rules of Biblical exegesis, precedence is given to the <i>gezeirah shaveh</i>. A person is able to derive a <i>kal vichomer</i> on the basis of his own process of reasoning. In contrast, since a <i>gezeirah shaveh</i> is not the product of one's own thought process, it is more likely to be forgotten. Hence, it is given precedence."
Torah Study 4.8,"one a student and one a commoner, attention is paid to the student. -"," Though a student need not be honored in the same way as a sage, a student's dedication to Torah study is deserving of a certain measure of respect."
Torah Study 4.8,"or both questions concern actual deeds - from this point on, the spokesman -"," who relays the questions to the teacher, as mentioned in halachah 3."
Torah Study 4.9,"This is alluded to in Solomon's words of wisdom [<a href=""/16394#v21"">Proverbs 23:21</a>]: ""Drowsiness will clothe a man in rags."" -"," <i>Sanhedrin, op. cit.,</i> quotes Rabbi Zeira (see above) as making this statement."
Torah Study 4.9,in the house of study. -," <i>Berachot, loc. cit.,</i> relates that this rule was observed in Rabban Gamliel's house of study."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.1,and to consider it as dust --," The Rambam describes the more practical aspects of the nullification of chametz in Chapter 3, Halachot 7-10. There, he requires a person to make a formal statement nullifying his chametz. That declaration is a Rabbinic requirement. According to the Torah itself, a firm resolve is sufficient, and no statement is necessary (<i>Binyan Shlomo</i>)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.3,According to the Sages' decree --," As explained in the previous halachah, according to the Torah, chametz may be within a person's property as long as he declared it ownerless. Nevertheless, the Sages forbade such practices and required all chametz to be removed from one's property.</p>
<p>Two reasons are given for this decree:</p>
<p>a) The nullification of chametz is dependent on the feelings of a person's heart. A person may possibly have difficulty totally removing all thoughts of ownership over the chametz from his heart (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Pesachim</i> 2a).</p>
<p>b) In contrast to other prohibited substances, chametz is used throughout the year. Thus, were he allowed to leave chametz within his property, he might accidentally forget about the prohibition and eat it on Pesach (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 2a).</p>
<p>In addition to the restriction against possessing chametz, the Sages further expanded the scope of"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.3,involves] searching for chametz --," It must be emphasized that the obligation to search for chametz is Rabbinic in nature only when a person nullifies his chametz when required. Otherwise, the obligation stems from the Torah, for the prohibitions against possessing chametz and the commandment to destroy it require such a search. The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> quotes a number of examples that demonstrate how the existence of a Torah commandment obligates a person to check and search to see that it is being fulfilled correctly."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.3,seeking it --, <i>Bedikat chametz</i>
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.3,"Similarly, according to the Sages' decree, we must search, [with the intent to] destroy, chametz by candlelight, at night --"," The destruction of chametz at night refers to the statement חמירא כל, in which we nullify all the chametz of whose possession we are unaware. The chametz that we know about is either eaten or destroyed the next morning."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.3,[They instituted the search at that time] --," in contrast to the day of the fourteenth, when the prohibition against possessing chametz begins (<i>Pesachim</i> 4a)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.3,and the light of the candle is good for searching. --," during the day, its light would not be as effective."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.3,"Similarly, a wise man should not begin to study [at this time] --"," half an hour before nightfall (<i>Magen Avraham, Orach Chayim</i> 431:3)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.4,"We do not search [for chametz] by the light of the moon, the light of the sun --"," if one searches by day; i.e., either one forgot to search on the night of the thirteenth and had to carry out the search the following day. Alternatively, one decided to search for chametz before the fourteenth of Nisan with the intention of keeping the room chametz-free afterwards (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 1:1). The light of the sun is insufficient to check indoor areas carefully."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.4,only by the light of a candle --, It is customary to use a candle made from beeswax.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.4,which has much light --, <i>Pesachim</i> 8a states that the same principle applies to the area directly under an aperture in the roof. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 433:4) also applies this principle to the area directly opposite an open window.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.4,The middle of a courtyard --," <i>Pesachim</i> 8a states ""a courtyard need not be searched."" The Rambam adds the words ""the middle"" out of fear that the birds will not eat the chametz in the cracks and holes close to the wall. In this case as well, though other authorities are more lenient, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 433:6) quotes the Rambam's opinion."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.5,A hole --, The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 433:4) applies the same principle to protrusions extending from a wall.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.5,of [the wall of] the house --," In previous generations, the walls of the homes were very thick and large holes would frequently be used for storage."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.5,"each searching to the extent his hand reaches. [Afterwards,] each must nullify in his heart [any chametz in] the remaining portion --"," As mentioned in Halachah 2, according to Torah law, the nullification of chametz is sufficient."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.5,fear that the Jew is casting spells against him --, This might motivate him to harm the Jew. The Sages did not require a Jew to endanger himself to fulfill their decrees.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.6,The upper --," those above a person's reach (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 433:4)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.6,[in the wall] of a house --," This halachah continues the final clause of the previous one, listing a number of places into which chametz is generally not brought."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.6,"a cow stall, chicken coop --"," Rashi, <i>Pesachim</i> 8a, explains that most likely, the animals and the chickens will eat any chametz brought there. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 433:6) qualifies this leniency explaining that it does not apply when a person definitely knows that chametz was brought into these premises one month before Pesach. (See <i>Magen Avraham</i>; the <i>Makor Chayim</i> brings a more lenient opinion.) In such an instance, he must search the premises on the night of the thirteenth by candlelight."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.6,and storage rooms for large fish --," Small fish may be taken out during the course of a meal. However, generally, a person will take large fish to prepare only before a meal and not in the midst of eating."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.6,"In contrast, storage rooms for beer, storage rooms for wine from which supplies are taken [in the midst of a meal], storage rooms for salt, candles, small fish, wood, and brine --"," In all these cases, the Sages regarded it likely that a person would get up in the middle of a meal while holding chametz in his hand to bring supplies from these storage rooms. Hence, they required such premises to be searched."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.6,"and all similar places must be searched, for chametz is usually brought into them --"," Thus, unless a person knows otherwise, he must act under the presumption that he brought chametz into these premises."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.7,"We do not suspect that a weasel dragged chametz into a place where it is not usually brought. — <i>Pesachim</i> 9a states: ""We do not suspect that a weasel dragged chametz from one house to another or from place to place."" Rashi explains that this statement applies after the search for chametz was carried out. Once we have searched our homes, we need not worry that rodents brought new chametz there.","</p>
<p>In contrast, the Rambam interprets the statement as applying before the search. There is no need to suspect that perhaps a rodent took chametz from a place where chametz is usually kept to a place where it is not usually brought. The Kessef Mishneh emphasizes that the two interpretations are not contradictory and both are halachically applicable."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.7,A person who checked on the night of the fourteenth --, as required
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.7,"and [later] found [only] nine must suspect [that chametz is present in his home,] and [hence,] must search a second time --", The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:7) relates that he may stop the second search as soon as one loaf is found. He may presume that this was the loaf that he originally put aside.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.8,"Similarly, a person who saw a mouse enter the house with chametz in its mouth after he searched [for chametz] must search a second time --"," In this instance as well, there is an obvious reason for the suspicion that chametz has been brought into the home."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.8,"Rather, we suspect that it left the bread in a hole or window, and that these crumbs were [originally] located there --"," and accidentally ignored, and the mouse deposited the bread it was carrying elsewhere."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.8,"If he does not find anything, he must search through the entire house --"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 438:1) quotes this opinion as halachah. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (based on the <i>Tur</i>) is more lenient. Rather than require that the entire house be searched, he maintains that searching the room that the mouse entered is sufficient."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.8,that the mouse took when he entered --, He must be able to recognize this as the bread seen in the mouse's mouth
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.9,[A person who] saw an infant enter an already checked house --, checked for chametz
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.9,We may confidently assume that he ate the bread and that these crumbs fell from him while eating --," <i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 10b) require a second search if the amount of crumbs does not equal the quantity of the original bread. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> favor the Rambam's opinion only when the person has nullified his ownership over his chametz. If not, the search takes on the seriousness of a Torah commandment. Hence, it must be repeated."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.10,Nine piles of matzah and one of chametz were placed [aside] --," For example, after the search for chametz, a person will still have some chametz in his property for use the following morning. However, he may already bring out his Passover matzot."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.10,and entered a house that had been checked --, for chametz
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.10,"for every instance where [a doubt arises and the presence of both the permitted and forbidden substances] is fixed, [is judged] as if they --", the permitted and forbidden substances
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.11,"There were two piles: one of chametz and one of matzah, and two houses: one that had been searched and one that had not been searched. Two mice came; one took chametz and one took matzah [and they entered the houses] without our knowing which house the mouse holding the chametz entered... --"," In such an instance, we presume that the mouse holding the chametz entered the unchecked house, and the mouse holding the matzah entered the checked house. Comparable decisions are found in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 13:14, <i>Hilchot Issurei Biyah</i> 9:29 and <i>Hilchot Mikvaot</i> 10:3.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> 10a emphasizes that this leniency is only rendered because once a person has nullified ownership over his chametz, the search is only a question of Rabbinic law. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:4) agrees to this principle, but offers an addition leniency: Even if the owner did not nullify his chametz, a second search is not required when the bread the mouse was holding is small enough to be eaten at once."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.11,"or we saw which one he entered, a person followed him, checked [for chametz], and did not find anything... --"," <i>Pesachim</i> 10a compares this to a case in which a corpse was presumed to be found in a field. Though Rabbi Meir maintains that the field is considered ritually impure until the corpse is found, the halachah follows the Sages, who maintain that all that is necessary is to carry out a thorough search. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:6) states that this law applies even when the owner of the house had not nullified his chametz, and the search is required by Torah law."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.11,"Similarly, when there were nine piles of matzah and one of chametz, and a loaf became separated from the piles, and we do not know whether it was chametz or matzah: If a mouse took the loaf that became separated and entered the house that had been checked --"," The passage from <i>Pesachim</i> 9b concerning the ten butcher shops quoted in the commentary on the previous halachah, continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[If meat from these shops] is found, follow the majority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The principle of קבוע - judging the permitted and forbidden substances as if they were equal - applies only when the doubt concerning the identity of the substance arises in the place where the presence of the forbidden substance has become fixed. Thus, since the meat has become separated (פירש) from its original place, this principle no longer applies and, as in most cases of mixtures, the decision depends on whether there is a greater number of kosher or non-kosher stores.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the case at hand: Since the loaf became separated from the piles before being taken by the mouse, there is no question of a prohibited substance having a fixed identity (קבוע). Hence, we follow the majority, and thus do not require a further search. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> emphasize that this leniency applies even if the owner of the house had not nullified the ownership over his chametz."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.12,"In the following cases, a second search is required.",
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.12,or who put aside nine loaves and found ten --," <i>Pesachim</i> 10a compares this to the following case: ""A person put aside 100 dinars of money designated as <i>ma'aser sheni</i> (the second tithe, to be used only to purchase food in Jerusalem) and discovered two hundred.""</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 6:3, the Rambam declares that none of the money is considered as <i>ma'aser sheni</i>. In both instances, we suppose that the substance put aside was taken away and a new substance substituted for it. Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> emphasizes that the owner cannot cease his search until he finds nine piles of chametz. This law applies even if the owner has nullified his ownership over the original nine piles of chametz."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.13,A mouse entered a house with a loaf --, of chametz
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.13,If the first mouse which entered was black and the one which left white --," Obviously, the mouse which left is not the same as the mouse that entered, and it is not likely that one mouse took the chametz from the other (<i>Pesachim</i> 10b). Hence,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.13,"If a mouse entered with a loaf in its mouth and a weasel left there with a loaf in its mouth, he must search [again]. --"," Even though it is possible that the weasel took the chametz from the mouse, that probability is not strong enough to free the owner from the obligation to search (<i>Pesachim</i>, ibid.). This applies even if he nullifies his chametz (<i>Pri Chadash, Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.13,"mouth, he does not have to search [again] --"," Even though one might say that unless the chametz is found in the mouse's mouth, we cannot be sure that it is the same. Nevertheless, since it is possible that the mouse dropped the chametz out of fear (<i>Pesachim</i> ibid.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.14,"When chametz is [discovered] on a very high beam, [the owner] is obligated to bring a ladder --", even if he must rent the ladder
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.14,If chametz is in a pit --, to which a person does not have easy access
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.15,A block of yeast which was designated to be used as a seat --," Generally, all prohibitions against eating forbidden foods do not apply after the food is no longer fit for human consumption. Nevertheless, additional stringencies are placed on chametz, because it may be useful as a leavening agent even if it is no longer fit to be eaten by a human being. Hence, it is not nullified until it is no longer fit even for animal consumption. (See Ra'avad, <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> Halachah 1:2.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.15,it is [considered as] destroyed and we are permitted to keep it [on Pesach] --," Its possession does not violate the prohibition against owning chametz.</p>
<p>The <i>Taz</i> emphasizes that only the prohibition against owning chametz is lifted. Even if the chametz is unfit for animal consumption, a person is forbidden to eat it on Pesach should he desire to do so."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.15,one is obligated to destroy [the dough under all circumstances] --, The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> emphasizes that this applies even when one has nullified his ownership over this chametz or covered it with mortar. The size of an olive is considered as a significant amount and must be destroyed at all times.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.15,If it --, the dough
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.15,because of its minimal size --," and, therefore, need not be destroyed."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.15,one is obligated to destroy it --," for the obligation to search after and destroy chametz applies to all quantities of that substance, even if they are smaller than the size of an olive (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442:28) explains that dough which has not become stuck to the cracks of the kneading trough must be removed. However, leniency may be taken regarding dough stuck in the cracks of the kneading trough, even though it does not serve a purpose. Should the owner nullify his ownership over his chametz, that dough need not be destroyed if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) the entire kneading trough contains less than an olive size of chametz stuck to its sides;</p>
<p>b) the dough has become dirty and unfit for consumption."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.15,"each] half the size of an olive were found in separate places, and a string of dough connects them --"," Thus, the question is raised:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the two considered as a single quantity, and hence obligated to be destroyed; or</p>
<p>Can they be considered as separate entities, and thus allowed to be kept?"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.16,To what does the above --, leniency
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.16,"one is obligated to destroy [the dough] even if, when the [connecting] thread [of dough] is lifted up, the pieces of dough are not raised up with it --"," Based on this decision, whenever there is more than the size of an olive of dough in the same room, we are obligated to destroy any and all pieces of dough in the room, even if they are not connected by strings of dough."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.16,If half of an olive size [of dough] was found in a house and another half in the second storey --, where it would be unlikely for the two halves to come together (ibid.);
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.16,or if half of the size of an olive was found in a room --," Generally, the word בית means ""house."" However, it is often used to mean ""room."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.16,"Since these portions of dough which are less than the size of an olive are found stuck to the walls, beams, or floors [of the house] --"," This is a major point of debate among the halachic authorities. Rabbenu Asher (<i>Pesakim, Pesachim</i> 3:2) writes that the dough need not be stuck to the walls of the house. However, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> oppose that thesis. They argue that the only reason for leniency is that when the dough is stuck to the walls of the house, it is considered as part of the house and not as an entity in its own right."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.17,A person who rents out a house on the fourteenth [of Nisan] --," One might suppose that the sequence of this halachah and the following halachah should be reversed. First, the Rambam should state who is obligated to search for chametz, and only then the fact that we can rely that this search was properly carried out. Indeed, <i>Pesachim</i> 4 and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> follows that sequence when discussing these laws.</p>
<p>Possibly, the Rambam's choice of sequence can be explained as follows: The motivating principle of many of the previous halachot is that once a person has nullified the ownership over his chametz, the search is merely a Rabbinic obligation. Hence, many leniencies can be taken.</p>
<p>Because of that same principle..."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.17,and he need not search. --," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 437:2) qualifies this statement, requiring the prospective tenant to ask the owner of the house if it has been searched. However, if he cannot possibly ask the owner, he need not search the house. However, this applies only when the tenant has the opportunity to nullify his ownership over any chametz that may be found within the home."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.17,"should a woman or a minor say: ""We have searched it,"" they are believed --"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> emphasize that this law applies only if the chametz has been nullified. Otherwise, the statement of a woman or child may not be relied upon.</p>
<p>Generally, a woman's statements are accepted even as regards Torah prohibitions. However, an exception is made in this case because the search for chametz involves much effort. Hence, our Sages worried that perhaps a woman might state that she had made a thorough search even though she had merely made a superficial inspection (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 4b)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.17,"Everyone is acceptable to search [for chametz], even women, slaves-", <i>Tosefot</i> (ibid.) states that slaves are believed in matters where a woman's word is accepted.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.18,A person who rents --, Different rules apply to a sale (Rabbenu Nissim).
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.18,the fourteenth [of Nisan] --," i.e., the night between the thirteenth and the fourteenth"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.18,the landlord is responsible for searching. --," He is required to undertake this search, even though he has abandoned ownership over any chametz that might be left in the house and does not violate the prohibitions against possessing chametz because of it (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 437:1)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.18,the tenant is responsible for checking --," Even though the chametz was left by the landlord, when the tenant takes over the landlordship of the house, he becomes the owner of all its contents, including the chametz."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.18,[the tenant] is responsible for searching it --, He must carry out the mitzvah even though he made an explicit condition requiring the landlord to do so.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.18,This applies even when it is customary --, in that locale
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.19,A person who sets out to sea or one who leaves in a caravan within thirty days [of Pesach] is obligated to search --," Furthermore, any chametz which he knows about must be removed from his possession (<i>Magen Avraham, Orach Chayim</i> 436:1."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.19,[If he leaves] before thirty days [prior to Pesach] --," Thirty days before Pesach, we begin ""asking and explaining the laws of the holiday."" Hence, from that time onward, concern is shown for all the Pesach laws (<i>Pesachim</i> 6a)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.19,he must search before departing --, even if he departs at the beginning of the year (<i>Pesachim</i> 6a).
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.19,when he will have no opportunity to destroy [the chametz]. --," As stated in Halachah 1:9, the prohibitions against possessing chametz begin after the conclusion of the fifth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan. From that time onward, it is forbidden to nullify any chametz that we possess."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.19,he does not have to search --," Nevertheless, he is obligated to nullify any chametz that might be in his possession on Pesach eve. This nullification takes effect even though he is very far from the chametz in his home (Ramah, <i>Magen Avraham</i>)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.19,If he does so --, intentionally covering the chametz with other goods
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.19,"Over thirty days before Pesach: If he intends to remove the goods before Pesach, he is required to search --"," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>) quote certain opinions that do not obligate a search, explaining that it is far less likely that the person will be delayed in removing his goods and bring about a situation where he will uncover the chametz on Passover eve."

Blessings 11.12,before wrapping oneself in <i>tzitzit</i> -," A mitzvah that, as mentioned in the previous halachah, has a non-obligatory nature. The Torah does not obligate us to wear <i>tzitzit</i> each day. (See <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:11.) Nevertheless, a person who wears a garment requiring <i>tzitzit</i> is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah each day."
Blessings 11.12,before sitting in the <i>sukkah</i> -," a mitzvah that is obligatory in nature, but which can be performed only during a certain time of the year."
Blessings 11.12,"Similarly, one recites the blessings -", The Rambam mentions Shabbat candles and Hallel specifically because these are Rabbinic mitzvot.
Blessings 11.12,"Similarly, if one affixes a <i>mezuzah</i> on one's own house -"," The Rambam mentions the mitzvot of <i>mezuzah</i> and a guardrail for two reasons: First, as explained in the commentary on the previous halachah, there is a non-obligatory aspect to these mitzvot. Second, as explained in the following halachah, there is a difference whether one performs these mitzvot by oneself or whether one performs them on behalf of another person."
Blessings 11.12,"Should one separate terumah for oneself, one should recite the blessing ""... to separate [terumah]."" -", The Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> also mention the separation of tithes in this context.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.1","Women, slaves, and minors are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah of] sukkah. -"," The same laws that apply to hearing the <i>shofar</i> apply to Sukkah. Hence, women and slaves are free of obligation, as is the case regarding all mitzvot whose fulfillment is associated with a specific time. Minors have no obligations at all according to the Torah. (See the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)</p>
<p>See also the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 2 regarding a woman's right to perform the mitzvah if she desires, and whether permission is granted for her to recite a blessing."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.1","Similarly, a person who is half slave and half free is obligated. -"," See the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachot 1 and 3."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.1","i.e., a child of five or six - is obligated [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah according to Rabbinic decree -"," According to Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) and the Ramban (<i>Milchamot Hashem, Berachot</i> 20b), there is no obligation incumbent on the child himself. The child's father is obligated to educate him. If he has no father, the obligation falls on his mother and on the local Rabbinic court (<i>Terumat Hadeshen</i> 99).</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) differs and explains that the Sages placed the obligation on the minor himself. From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he accepts this view.</p>
<p>Support for this premise can be derived from the Rambam's decision in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who ate a small meal can fulfill his obligation by listening to a child reciting the grace after meals (for both are obligated by virtue of Rabbinic decree). Though others object on the grounds that the child himself is not obligated in the mitzvah, the Rambam states that such a practice is acceptable."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.2",The sick and their attendants -," Since the latter's performance of a mitzvah - tending to the sick - does not enable them to perform the mitzvah of dwelling in the sukkah, they are absolved from the obligation. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 25a, 26a.) However, this leniency is granted only during the time the sick person requires their assistance (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:7)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.2",but also to one with a headache -," or any other minor illness (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:4).</p>
<p>This leniency is granted because of one of the basic principles related to the mitzvah of sukkah. <a href=""/9924#v42"">Leviticus 23:42</a> states: ""You shall dwell in sukkot (תשבו בסכת)."" On that verse, <i>Sukkah</i> 26a comments: תשבו כעין תדורו - i.e., dwelling in the sukkah is comparable to living in one's own home. Thus, a person is not required to dwell in a sukkah under circumstances which would cause him to leave his own home.</p>
<p>Since a person who is sick would seek the most comfortable lodgings possible and would not camp outside, he is not obligated to do so to fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah (Rabbenu Manoach)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.2",A person who is uncomfortable [when dwelling in the sukkah] is freed from the obligation [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah. -," based on the principle of תשבו כעין תדורו, as explained above. Just as a person would seek out a comfortable permanent dwelling, he is obligated to dwell only in a sukkah which does not cause him unpleasantness.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach states that this leniency does not apply on the first night of Sukkot, on which there is a binding obligation to eat in the sukkah. (See Halachah 6.) The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 640:4) quotes this statement as halachah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.3",A mourner -," The term אבל refers to a person in the seven days of mourning which follow the burial of a father, mother, wife, brother, sister, son, or daughter. An אונן (a person in mourning for these relatives before their burial) is freed from the obligation of sukkah, because he is absolved of the duty to perform all mitzvot (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 4:6).</p>
<p>It must be noted that none of the mourning rites should be followed during a festival. If a close relative dies before the festival, the <i>shiv'ah</i> (seven days of mourning) is completed at the festival's commencement, even though all seven days have not passed (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 10:3, 8)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.3",A groom -," because he is involved in the mitzvah of marriage. <i>Sukkah</i> 25b adds that generally, a sukkah is to small to carry out the wedding celebrations in the proper manner. Furthermore, the groom is obligated to rejoice together with his wife, and the sukkah is not an appropriate setting."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.3",and all the members of the wedding party -," They are absolved of the mitzvah only while they are involved in the mitzvah of celebrating together with the bride and groom, however, when they leave, they are obligated. Furthermore, there are many authorities who require that the meals served the groom and his attendants be served in a sukkah. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 640:33.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.4",Emissaries charged with a mission involving a mitzvah -," e.g., to study Torah, to greet a Sage under whom one studied Torah, or to redeem captives (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 25a)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.4",both during the day and at night. -," Rashi (<i>Sukkah</i> 25a, 26a) states that this applies even when they are lodging overnight. Since, at night they are also involved with thinking about how to fulfill the mitzvah, they are still considered as occupied with the performance of a mitzvah and are not required to seek out a sukkah. An example of this principle quoted by the Talmud supports this interpretation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Rav Chisda and Rabbah bar Rav Huna would attend [the lecture delivered] at the home of the exilarch on the Sabbath of the festival, they would sleep along the river banks of Sura.</p>
<p>They explained: ""We are emissaries involved in a mitzvah"" (<i>Sukkah</i> 26a).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though these Sages were visiting a city which served as a center of Jewish life and surely could have found a sukkah to lodge in, they did not see the necessity for doing so. (See also <i>Sukkah</i> 10b.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 10b, interprets the passage differently and explains that leniency is granted these emissaries only when dwelling in the sukkah would in some way prevent them from carrying out the mitzvah which they set out to perform. If it is possible to do both - perform the mitzvah they set out to do and fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah - one must endeavor to do so.</p>
<p>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam shares Rashi's view. However, the final halachic position followed by most Ashkenazic authorities is closer to <i>Tosafot</i>'s position: i.e., these emissaries are not obligated to trouble themselves to find a sukkah. However, if there is a sukkah available, they should make use of it. Nevertheless, if sleeping in the sukkah would prevent them from getting proper rest, and thus hold them back from fulfilling their mitzvah in a proper manner, they are not required to sleep in a sukkah (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:18; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 640:38).</p>
<p>(Abstractly, it is possible to differentiate between the two positions as follows. According to Rashi, there is no obligation of sukkah incumbent on this person whatsoever. In contrast, <i>Tosafot</i> would maintain that the person is obligated to perform the mitzvah. However, at all times he is bound by another commitment which takes precedence.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.4",and are obligated at night -," if they lodge in a settled place (<i>Tosafot</i>, ibid.)."

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.5","How must the mitzvah of dwelling in the sukkah be fulfilled? A person must eat, drink, and live -", performing all the activities mentioned in this halachah and Halachot 6-9.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.5",both during the day and at night -," <i>Sukkah</i> 43a derives this concept by drawing an analogy (גזרה שוה) to the seven days of preparation for the dedication of the Sanctuary. Thus, just as the priests were required to stay in the Sanctuary for seven days - day and night - similarly, the mitzvah of sukkah must be observed in the same manner."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.5","During these seven days, he must consider his house as a temporary dwelling and the sukkah as his permanent home -"," This statement is a quote from the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:8. In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam defines קבע as ""of primary importance and a constant practice."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.5","What does this imply? His attractive utensils and attractive bedding - [should be brought] to the sukkah. His drinking utensils - i.e., his cups and crystal pitchers - [should be brought] to the sukkah. -", Doing so is a sign of honor and respect for the mitzvah.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.5",A candelabra -," i.e., the source of light"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.6","We should eat, drink, and sleep in the sukkah through the entire seven days [of the festival], both during the day and at night. It is forbidden to eat a meal -"," i.e., a meal of bread or food prepared from the five species of grain"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.6","However, [there is no prohibition] if one eats a snack -"," even of bread, outside the sukkah.</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 26a defines ""a snack"" as ""what the students will eat before they enter the study sessions."" In his commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:4, the Rambam explains it as ""a small amount, [eaten] without considering it as a meal, in order to satisfy one's hunger [temporarily], until one can complete eating afterwards.""</p>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach explains that though there is no prohibition involved, it is not desirable to eat even a snack of bread outside the sukkah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.6",or even slightly more. -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 639:2) restricts the leniency to a <i>k'beitzah</i> (approximately 56 cubic centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and, in this instance, 41 cubic centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>) alone (See <i>Tosafot, Yoma</i> 79a.) The same principles are also applied to cooked foods made from the five species of grain."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.6",It is permissible to drink water -," or any other beverage, including wine (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:2), outside the sukkah. There is a difference of opinion among the later halachic authorities if this decision also applies when one sits down to a party centering on drinking wine (קובע עצמו לשתות). Some (the <i>Bach</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:12) require that such drinking be carried out in a sukkah. However, others (the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:13) are more lenient."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.7",Eating in the sukkah on the first night of the festival is an obligation. -," <i>Sukkah</i> 27a draws an analogy between the first night of Sukkot and the first night of Pesach. Just as eating a <i>k'zayit</i> of matzah on the fifteenth of Nisan is a mitzvah, so too, each Jewish male is required to eat in the sukkah on the fifteenth of Tishre."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.7","he fulfills his obligation. Afterwards, [the matter is left to one's] volition. -"," The difference in the requirement between the first night and the remaining days has other ramifications. As mentioned in Halachah 2, a person who is uncomfortable in the sukkah is freed from his obligation. However, this leniency applies only on the first night after the mitzvah of eating a <i>k'zayit</i> has been fulfilled (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:3)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.7","one must eat it in the sukkah. If one desires, throughout the seven [days of the festival], one may eat only fruit or roasted grain -", which may be eaten...
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.8",It is forbidden for a person to sit and eat with his head and the majority of his body inside a sukkah while his table is in his home or outside the sukkah. -," The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:6) records a difference of opinion on this matter between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel. In this instance, the halachah follows the School of Shammai."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.9","Throughout the seven days [of the festival], a person should read in the sukkah. -"," Since the person must regard his sukkah as his home throughout the festival, in addition to eating and sleeping, he must perform all his other day-to-day functions inside of it. Hence, he should also read in the sukkah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.9",so that his mind will be settled -," while he studies. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 639:13 adds a further reason to study at home: the difficulty in bringing one's texts back and forth from the sukkah. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that this matter also depends on the individual person. If he is as comfortable studying in the sukkah as studying at home, he is obligated to do so."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.10","If rain descends, a person may enter his home. -"," The descent of rain on Sukkot implies that our actions are not desired by God. The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:8) compares the matter to a servant who came to serve his master drink and the latter poured the pitcher in his face.</p>
<p><i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there is a fundamental difference between this law and the case of a person who is uncomfortable while in the sukkah. In the latter instance, in essence, the person is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. However, because of his discomfort, his obligation is temporarily waived. In contrast, when rain descends it is impossible to fulfill the mitzvah at all, because the sukkah is not fit to dwell in. Hence, there is no obligation whatsoever.</p>
<p>There is a practical difference between these two abstract positions regarding the question whether a person is obligated to eat in the sukkah on the first night of the holiday even when it rains. (See the commentary on Halachah 7.) According to the <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, under these circumstances there is no mitzvah which one is required to fulfill. Thus, one may eat at home. In contrast, most authorities do not differentiate between rain and other uncomfortable situations. Thus, since eating in the sukkah on that night is a binding obligation, they require a person to fulfill the mitzvah.</p>
<p>There is a further aspect to this concept. The Maharil explains that a person who eats in a sukkah when he is not obligated to do so is a simple person and receives no reward for his ""piety."" On this basis, in many communities, people make no effort to stay in the sukkah when it rains. In contrast, there are some communities where people will continue to eat in the sukkah despite pouring rain.</p>
<p>What is the difference between these two approaches? The first approach follows the perspective that, during the rain, there is no mitzvah to dwell in the sukkah whatsoever. Hence, there is no need to strain oneself to remain there. In contrast, the second perspective does not differentiate between rain and any other uncomfortable circumstances, but maintains that, in essence, dwelling in the sukkah is a mitzvah even under such circumstances. Accordingly, they remain in the sukkah, because while they are involved in fulfilling God's will they do not feel even the slightest trace of discomfort."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.10",when enough raindrops descend into the sukkah so that they would spoil a cooked dish -," We need not wait until the food actually spoils. As soon as enough rain descends to spoil the food, one is free to enter one's home (Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:5)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.10",were they to fall into it.,
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.10",{that entire night} -," This phrase is set off by brackets because it is most likely a printing error. It is not easily understood, nor is it found in the manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> or in the quotation of this halachah in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 639:6)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.10",If he was sleeping and rain descended -," The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:7) emphasizes that even the slightest amount of rain is sufficient to free one from the obligation of sleeping in the sukkah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.10","Rather, he may remain sleeping that entire night in his house -"," even if he wakes up in the middle of the night and it is no longer raining, he is not required to move to the sukkah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.11",A person should not take apart his sukkah after he finishes eating on the seventh day [of Sukkot]. -, lest he require it later during the day.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.11",If he has no place to put the utensils -," i.e., if he used his home as a sukkah, and thus must continue to remain there on Shemini Atzeret (see <i>Sukkah</i> 48a)..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.11",at least four handbreadths by four handbreadths -," to make the sukkah, or at least a significant portion of it, unfit for use. This safeguards against the violation of the command of בל תוסיף (<a href=""/9977#v1"">Deuteronomy 13:1)</a>, which forbids adding to the mitzvot of the Torah. These acts will differentiate between his eating in the sukkah during the festival, when he is required to do so in fulfillment of the mitzvah, and eating there afterwards, once the mitzvah has been completed (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 666).</p>
<p>The Ramah adds that this requirement applies only when one desires to eat in the sukkah on Shemini Atzeret. Once that holiday passes, one may eat in a sukkah without making any changes."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.12","Whenever a person enters a sukkah with the intention of sitting down throughout the seven [days of Sukkot], he should recite the following blessing -"," Note the commentary on Halachah 7, which explains the difference between this law and the rules governing the blessing recited before eating matzah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.12",[Blessed are You...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to dwell in the sukkah. -," The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that there is no limit to the number of times one recites the blessing each day. Nevertheless, if one left the sukkah for a brief interval or left with the intent of performing an activity which would improve the sukkah, that departure is not considered an interruption and no blessing is required upon one's return."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.12",One should recite all the blessings over a cup of wine -, as did Rav Kahana (<i>Sukkah</i> 46a).
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.12",while standing -," The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 643:2) states that kiddush may be recited while sitting."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.12","sit, and then recite the blessing shehecheyanu. -"," On the second night, it is Ashkenazic custom to recite to the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> before the blessing <i>leishev basukkah</i>, since on that occasion the blessing is associated with the celebration of the festival and not the mitzvah of sukkah. (See <i>Bnei Binyamin</i>.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.12",of Spain -, The Ra'avad objects and comments that even in Spain such a custom was not followed.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.13",At present -," in the Diaspora and in certain places in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> (<i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i>, Chapter 9)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.13",we dwell in the sukkah for eight days. -," In deference to the possibility that the festival could have begun on the second day and the seven days should be counted from then.</p>
<p>The commandment בל תוסיף (<a href=""/9977#v1"">Deuteronomy 13:1)</a> forbids adding to the mitzvot of the Torah. Indeed, in Halachot 11 and 14, we find certain safeguards instituted because of this commandment. Nevertheless, dwelling in the sukkah on the eighth day does not constitute a violation of this commandment, because the time when the mitzvah is to be performed has already passed. Placing a fifth passage in one's tefillin during the day violates this commandment, because we are obligated to perform the mitzvah at this time. However, once the seven days of Sukkot pass, there is no mitzvah associated with the sukkah whatsoever (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28b).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many Ashkenazic authorities would carry out additional safeguards regarding this matter. For example, the <i>Tur</i> relates (though he opposes this practice himself) that some follow the custom of eating in the Sukkah only on the day of Shemini Atzeret, but not the night. Many of the Rabbis who would sleep in the Sukkah throughout the festival refrain from doing so on Shemini Atzeret. (See <i>K'tav Sofer</i>, Responsum 120.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.13","we dwell in the sukkah, but do not recite the blessing leishev basukkah. -"," because as the Rambam explains, a blessing is not recited when a mitzvah is performed only because of a doubt.</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 47a relates that ""Rav Huna bar Bizna and all the great Sages of the generation dwelled in a sukkah on the eighth day - which might have been the seventh day - [of the festival], but did not recite a blessing."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.13","never recite the blessing leishev basukkah, because their obligation [to perform the mitzvah is based] on doubt -"," i.e., they are required to perform the mitzvah because of the doubt concerning their status: maybe they are to be considered men."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.14","After a person finishes eating on the eighth day [of Sukkot], he should take down his utensils and remove them -"," from the sukkah and bring them home, where he will eat on Simchat Torah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.14",[the following rules -," safeguards adopted to differentiate between eating in the sukkah as required, and eating there afterwards"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.14","if it is a large sukkah, he should bring in his pots, plates, and the like -"," which are generally kept outside the sukkah, as explained in Halachah 5."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.14",is no longer acceptable and that its mitzvah is completed.,
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.15",A person who did not construct a sukkah [before the holiday] - whether intentionally or unintentionally -," <i>Sukkah</i> 27b explains that not only a person whose sukkah fell down in the middle of the festival should reconstruct it, but even one who never built a sukkah at all is entitled to do so."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.15","One should even construct a sukkah in the final moments of the seventh day, because its mitzvah lasts throughout the seventh day. -", See Halachah 11.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.15",on all eight days of the festival. -," <i>Sukkah</i> 9a derives the prohibition against using the wood of the sukkah for other purposes throughout Sukkot from <a href=""/9924#v34"">Leviticus 23:34</a>: ""The Sukkot festival shall be seven days unto God."" The latter term is used also regarding the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering sacrificed on the festival. Thus, its use in this context implies that the entities which enable us to celebrate the Sukkot festival must be consecrated ""unto God"" like those sacrifices.</p>
<p>The reason why the wood of the sukkah may not be used on the eighth day is explained below."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.15",Throughout [these] eight days -," Note the contrast to the etrog in Chapter 7, Halachah 27."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.15",[They are prohibited on the eighth day] because the sukkah is muktzeh -," <i>Muktzeh</i> literally means ""set aside."" In this context, it refers to objects which may not be used for mundane purposes."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.16","Similarly, it is forbidden to take from the food and beverages that were hung in the sukkah as decorations -"," even if they fall (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 638:2). As mentioned in the commentary on Halachot 17 and 18, the sukkah decorations are not considered an independent entity, but rather as part of the sukkah itself. Furthermore, employing articles used to decorate a mitzvah for other purposes demonstrates lack of respect for the mitzvah (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Beitzah</i>). Hence, the same restrictions that apply to the sukkah apply to it."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.16","However, if at the time one hung [the decorations] -", Rabbenu Manoach questions what the law would be if the condition were made after the decorations were hung but before the holiday commences.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.16",he is entitled to use them whenever he desires -," In contrast to the walls or <i>s'chach</i>, in this instance the condition has an effect. It is possible for a sukkah to exist without decorations, but not without walls (Rabbenu Manoach)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.1",In what manner are the <i>tefillin</i> [placed on] the head written? [The] four passages -," mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 1: <i>Kadesh Li</i> (<a href=""/9874#v1"">Exodus 13:1</a>-10), <i>V'hayah ki y'viacha</i> (<a href=""/9874#v11"">Exodus 13:11</a>-16), <i>Shema</i> (<a href=""/9970#v4"">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>-8), and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> (<a href=""/9975#v13"">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>-21)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.1",and rolled closed -," more precisely, folded closed. Though in this halachah, the Rambam mentions only the <i>tefillin</i> of the arm, the parchments in the <i>tefillin</i> of the head are also folded from the end to the beginning, so that when they are opened, one begins reading at the beginning (Chapter 3, Halachah 7)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.1",The four passages of [the <i>tefillin</i> placed on] the arm are written on four columns on a single parchment. -," They may, however, be written on four separate parchments, which are later glued together (<i>Menachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.2",Care must be taken in writing these passages. If one wrote a passage which should be s'tumah -," As the Rambam explains at length in Chapter 8, there are two general categories for the passages of the Torah, <i>s'tumah</i> and <i>p'tuchah</i>.</p>
<p><i>S'tumah</i> means ""closed."" It refers to a passage whose first word is always written in the middle of a line in the Torah. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)"
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.2","or a passage which should be p'tuchah as s'tumah, it is invalid. -"," The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:36) quotes an opinion which explains that the <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified for such an error. Since there is a difference between <i>tefillin</i> and a Torah scroll - in a Torah scroll, there are many other passages between <i>Shema</i> and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> - the <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified if <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> is written as <i>p'tuchah</i>. Contemporary Ashkenazic practice is based on this opinion. [Note our commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 2.]"
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.3",One must be careful regarding [the spelling of the words in these passages] with regard to the short or full form. -," There are times when the Hebrew vowels <i>cholam</i> and <i>shuruk</i> are written with a letter <i>vav</i>, and times when that letter is omitted. Similarly, there are times when the vowel <i>chirik</i> is written with a <i>yud</i>, and times when that letter is omitted.</p>
<p>The expression, <i>malei</i>, rendered as ""full form,"" refers to the form which includes the extra letter. <i>Chaseir</i>, rendered as ""short form,"" refers to the form which lacks the extra letter."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.3","When one writes a word which requires a short form using a full form, it is invalid until one erases the extra letter. -"," As mentioned above, every letter of the four passages in the <i>tefillin</i> must be written in order. Nevertheless, although an entire passage was written, correcting a word by erasing an extra letter is not a contradiction to this principle.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:23) mentions that a problem may arise if the letter to be erased is in the middle of a word, since, when it is erased, the space left will cause the word to appear divided. The commentaries explain that the difficulty can sometimes be corrected by extending a letter, for example, writing a <i>resh</i> with an extended upper line."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.10",A person who purchases <i>tefillin</i> from a person who is not an expert -," Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 39:8), which states: ""One should not purchase [tefillin] from a person who is not an expert."""
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.10","If he purchased 100 <i>tefillin</i>, he should inspect three, either two head <i>tefillin</i> and one arm <i>tefillin</i>, or two arm <i>tefillin</i> and one head <i>tefillin</i>. -", <i>Eruvin</i> 97a states that one must check at least one arm <i>tefillin</i> and one head <i>tefillin</i> to see that the scribe is proficient in writing both.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.10","Thus, they are all considered to be acceptable and need not be checked -", provided the person who sells them states that they were all written by the same individual (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 39:22).

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.11","or purchases them from another person and has them inspected, and places them in their leather [compartments], they need not ever be checked again. -"," The commentaries explain that since they are enclosed in compartments that are not exposed to air, we can presume that the letters are intact.</p>
<p>Though this decision is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 39:10), a qualification is already made. A pair of <i>tefillin</i> which is not worn on a regular basis should be checked twice in seven years. The later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 39:11 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:26) suggest checking even <i>tefillin</i> that are worn regularly. At present, perhaps because of the differences in the way the compartments are made or in the parchment or ink that is used, it is very common for letters in <i>tefillin</i> to smudge, fade, and crack. The <i>Mateh Efrayim</i> suggests that each person have his <i>tefillin</i> inspected every year. Even authorities who are not that stringent recommend periodic checks."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.11",We do not suspect that a letter has faded out or been perforated. Hillel the elder stated: “These [<i>tefillin</i>] -, the <i>tefillin</i> he himself wore

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 7.1","for yourselves,"" -"," The above is a quote from <i>Sanhedrin</i> 21b. The Talmud, however, does not explain how this verse serves as a commandment to write a Torah scroll. The following interpretation is the Rambam's."

His choice of phraseology implies a leniency. Were the king to inherit a scroll from his family, he need not write two scrolls (one to fulfill the mitzvah of writing a Torah scroll and one ""for the sake of his sovereignty"").

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 7.2",This scroll should be checked against the scroll in the Temple Courtyard -, The Rambam's source is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 2:6).

<p>There is a serious difference of opinion between the Rambam and Rabbenu Asher regarding the crowns. Rabbenu Asher maintains that crowns should be placed on the letters שעטנ""ז ג""ץ.

In the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 245:6), he explains that a father's obligation also includes arranging for his son's instruction in the Oral Law, unless his financial situation is too pressing to allow him to do so."
Torah Study 1.7,"The difference between the two opinions is that according to the latter, one may also charge adults. Since the Rambam allows a wage to be charged without qualifying his words, one may assume that this applies even to teaching adults.

Torah Study 1.8,Every Jewish man is obligated to study Torah -, This represents the second aspect of the mitzvah of Torah study; studying oneself.
Torah Study 1.8,The Talmud elaborates:<br/>,"</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;""><b>Hillel would work and earn a <i>tarp'eick</i> [a coin of little value] daily. Half he would give to the watchman at the Hall of Study, and half he would use for his livelihood and that of his family. One day he could not find work. The watchman at the entrance did not let him enter and so he hung himself over the window to hear ""the words of the living God"" from Shemayah and Avtalion.<br/></b></p>
<p>In contrast, Rabbi Eleazar ben Chersom was extremely wealthy:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">His father left him one thousand villages on land and one thousand ships at sea. Each day, he would take a sack of flour on his shoulders and go from city to city to study Torah...Throughout his entire life, he did not go to see them [the villages and the ships], but rather sat and studied Torah the entire day and night.</p>
<p>of a healthy and complete body or afflicted by difficulties - <i>Bava Metzia</i> 84b relates that Rabbi Elazar ben Shimon was afflicted by severe physical difficulties. Nevertheless, he continued to persevere in his dedication to Torah study. Indeed, <i>Eruvin</i> 54a counsels that Torah study will help a person with health problems recover."
Torah Study 1.8,or an old man whose strength has diminished. -, See Halachah 10.
Torah Study 1.9,The greater Sages of Israel included wood choppers -," Many, including the Rambam (Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 4:7), cite the example of Hillel. However, as of yet, there is no explicit Talmudic or Midrashic source which states that Hillel was occupied in this profession. <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> (Chapter 6) states that Rabbi Akiva was so employed."
Torah Study 1.9,and blind men. -," Rav Yosef and Rav Sheshet, two of the more prominent <i>Amoraim</i>, were so afflicted (<i>Pesachim</i> 116b)."
Torah Study 1.10,Until when is a person obligated to study Torah? Until the day he dies -," <i>Shabbat</i> 83b states that even when a person feels death approaching, he should not neglect his Torah studies."
Torah Study 1.10,"Whenever a person is not involved with study, he forgets. -"," <i>Chaggigah</i> 15a states: ""The words of Torah are as difficult to acquire as gold vessels, and as easy to lose as glass utensils."" <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> 24:6 elaborates on how easy it is to forget one's Torah knowledge."
Torah Study 1.11,one third to the Oral Law -," i.e., <i>Mishnah</i>. This is not intended to mean only the <i>Mishnah</i> authored by Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi per se, but rather ""halachic decisions without being concerned with their motivating principles"" (Rashi, <i>Sotah</i> 22a). As is obvious from his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, where he defines it as ""a collection of the entire Oral Law,"" the Rambam desired that his <i>Mishneh Torah</i> serve this purpose.</p>
<p>According to <i>Siftei Cohen, Choshen Mishpat</i> 25:7, the term <i>Mishnah</i> applies to the halachic decisions of contemporary authorities as well. Thus, today, study of texts like the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> would fulfill this goal."
Torah Study 1.11,understanding [the Torah] based on the principles of Biblical exegesis -," e.g., the thirteen principles of Biblical exegesis mentioned by Rabbi Yishmael (introduction to the <i>Sifre</i>), the 32 principles mentioned by Rabbi Eleazar ben Yosse."
Torah Study 1.12,How is the above expressed? -," <i>Kiddushin, ibid.</i>, asks this question, noting that, on the surface, it is impossible to divide one's years in three, since no one knows how long he will live."
Torah Study 1.12,"A person who is a craftsman may spend three hours each day involved in his work, and [devote] nine hours to Torah study -"," Examples chosen by the Rabbis reflect common situations. Thus, these statements teach us what would be considered a commonplace division of one's time in the Rambam's age."
Torah Study 1.12,"The ""words of the prophetic tradition"" -"," the remainder of the Bible - i.e., the works of the prophets and the holy writings."

Torah Study 1.12,The above applies in the beginning stages of a person's study. -," The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam offered this explanation to resolve the apparent contradiction between the commonly accepted practice of devoting most of one's time to the study of the Babylonian Talmud, and the injunction to divide one's study time in three. In response to the same question, <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 30a explains that the study of the Babylonian Talmud also fulfills that directive, because it combines all three areas of study in a single text.</p>
<p>At present, this pattern of study is not followed even in the early stages of a child's learning. Note the Maharal of Prague, <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>, Chapter 56, and the <i>Sh'lah, Masechet Shavuot</i>, who complain that the advice given in <i>Avot</i> 5:22: ""At five, to the study of the Written Law; at ten, to the study of the Mishnah; and at fifteen, to the study of the Gemara"" is not generally followed.</p>
<p>The basis for this departure can be explained in terms of two differences that exist between our contemporary circumstances and the situation which prevailed in Talmudic times:<br/>
a) During the Talmudic era, written texts were rare, and it was necessary for a student to commit all his subject matter to memory. Thus, the emphasis was on teaching students by rote.<br/>
b) Hebrew was a spoken language and, therefore, it was not necessary to spend time teaching the children the meaning of the subject matter.</p>
<p>At present, the major emphasis is on teaching learning skills and developing a student's powers of comprehension with the understanding that once one knows how to study, since the texts are easily available, he will be able to apply himself to the actual study at his convenience. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:6, 11; <i>Eglei Tal</i>, Introduction.)"
Torah Study 1.12,"he should study the Written Law and the oral tradition at designated times. Thus, he will not forget any aspect of the laws of the Torah -"," as mentioned above, a lack of review will cause an individual to forget what he has already learned."

Torah Study 1.13,A woman who studies Torah will receive reward -, for her efforts.
Torah Study 1.13,"Chassidic thought explains the concept differently. The Hebrew word <i>mitzvah</i> (commandment) shares the same root as the word <i>tzavtah</i> (connection). Fulfilling the commandments establishes a transcendent bond with Godliness. In contrast, a good deed that is not commanded, no matter how worthy, remains an act of man and does not establish such a connection.",
Torah Study 1.13,because most women -," Commentaries have mentioned that by adding the word ""most,"" the Rambam implies that if a father sees that his daughter is capable of such study, he should afford her the opportunity."

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.1",There are ten requirements that must be met by a house for the person who dwells within to be obligated to affix a <i>mezuzah</i>. -, The Rambam's choice of phraseology emphasizes the concept mentioned in the previous halachah: that the <i>mezuzah</i> is the obligation of the dweller and not the dwelling.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.1",They are: a) for the area [of the dwelling] to be four cubits by four cubits or more; -, See Halachah 2.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.1",h) for it to be intended for human habition; -, This principle is not accepted by all authorities. See Halachah 7.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.2",A dwelling which is less than four cubits -," A cubit is approximately 48 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 58 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.2","If its area is equal to sixteen square cubits although it is circular, pentagonal, and needless to say, if it is rectangular -"," The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains the advantage of a rectangular shape based on <i>Hilchot Tzara'at</i> 14:6, which states that only a square or rectangular-shaped building is considered to be a house with regard to the impurity of <i>tzara'at</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.3","An excedra, a structure with three walls and a roof -"," An excedra was a very common structure in Greek and Roman architecture that was also frequently employed in Jewish homes. It resembled a porch with three sides enclosed and the fourth side left open. (At times, both the third and fourth sides were left open. See <i>Hilchot Sukkah</i> 4:8,9.)</p>
<p>It was covered by a roof which contained an aperture to allow sunlight to enter. Decorative pillars were placed at each of the corners of the aperture."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.3",The pillars are intended as supports for the roof and not as doorposts. -," When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 286:6) states that if the excedra has a wall (even if it is low) on the fourth side as well, a <i>mezuzah</i> is required. According to this decision, most porches that have pillars at their entrance require a <i>mezuzah</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.3","which stands on pillars, even though shaped like a house, does not require a <i>mezuzah</i>, because it has no doorposts. The pillars are intended -"," primarily, not to serve as doorposts, but"

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.5",[as appropriate]: If the covered portion is near the entrance -," and the covered portion is four cubits by four cubits (<i>Kessef Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 286:14). Note, however, the <i>Or Sameach</i>, which does not require the covered portion to be this size."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.6",[The gates to] the Temple Mount -," There was a wall around the complex of the Temple Mount separating it from the remainder of the city of Jerusalem. It had five gates, as described in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:2."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.6","and, similarly, entrances to synagogues -"," which are referred to as ""sanctuaries in microcosm"" (<i>Megillah</i> 29a)"
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.6","which do not have apartments in which people live do not require <i>mezuzot</i>, because they are consecrated. -"," <i>Yoma</i> 11b derives this concept from the exegesis of <a href=""/9970#v9"">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>: ""And you shall write them on the doorposts of your homes."" The Temple is not ""your home,"" a private dwelling, and therefore does not require a <i>mezuzah</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Chatam Sofer</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 281) asks: Since the Chamber of Parhedrin was the only portion within the Temple Courtyard used as a person's dwelling, why does the Rambam state that these entrances do not require <i>mezuzot</i> because they are consecrated? Since they are not used as a dwelling, why would one think they require a <i>mezuzah</i>?</p>
<p>The <i>Chatam Sofer</i> explains that the Temple is a dwelling - in fact, the ultimate dwelling, the resting place of the Divine Presence. Nevertheless, since it is not a dwelling for humans, it does not require a <i>mezuzah</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.6","All the gates in the Temple complex did not have <i>mezuzot</i>, with the exception of the Gate of Nicanor -"," The central gate to the Temple Courtyard. (See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:5.)</p>
<p>The Gate of Nicanor required a <i>mezuzah</i> because it was the gate directly before the Chamber of Parhedrin. As explained in Halachah 8, the gate of a courtyard which leads to a dwelling requires a <i>mezuzah</i>. Based on this rationale, Rav Kapach asks why the gates before the Gate of Nicanor did not require a <i>mezuzah</i>, since they led to a gate which led to a dwelling."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.6",further within -," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others note that the Rambam's text differs from his source (<i>Yoma</i>, loc. cit.), which reads ""the Gate of Nicanor and the Chamber of Parhedrin, which was further within."" He does explain, however, that the Rambam's version is acceptable: Since all these gates lead to the Chamber of Parhedrin, they therefore require a <i>mezuzah</i>.</p>
<p>Rav Kapach supports this interpretation, noting that the Chamber of the Hearth also served as a dwelling for the priests, and hence, the gate to it would require a <i>mezuzah</i>. According to this interpretation, this gate is also included, while according to our text of the Talmud, it is not."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.6",because this chamber served as a dwelling for the High Priest during the seven days -," Note <i>Yoma</i> 10b, which states that the obligation to place a <i>mezuzah</i> on the gate of Nicanor and the Chamber of Parhedrin applies only during these seven days and not throughout the entire year. Nevertheless, since as stated in Chapter 5, Halachah 11, one should not remove a <i>mezuzah</i> after leaving a dwelling, the <i>mezuzah</i> should remain there (Rav Kapach)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.7","A storage house for straw, a barn for cattle, a woodshed, or [other] storage rooms -"," Rav David Arameah notes that there are commentaries who point to a contradiction between these statements and <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 7:5, where the Rambam states that a soldier who is excused from the battlefield for building a new house (see <a href=""/9984#v5"">Deuteronomy 20:5)</a>, is released for constructing one of these structures.</p>
<p>He explains, however, that the Rambam's phraseology clearly indicates how this difficulty can be resolved. In <i>Hilchot Melachim</i>, the Rambam states that these structures are ""fit to dwell in."" In this halachah, he states that they are not ""set aside for their use.""</p>
<p>A house requires a <i>mezuzah</i> only when a person dwells in it. Accordingly, since these structures are not used for that purpose, they do not require a <i>mezuzah</i>. To receive an exemption from military service, all that is necessary is to build a house ""fit to dwell in."" Since it is possible to use these structures for that purpose, the exemption is granted."

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.8","all require a <i>mezuzah</i>, since houses which require a <i>mezuzah</i> open up to them. -"," <i>Yoma</i> 11a relates that the obligation to affix <i>mezuzot</i> on such structures is derived from the inclusion of the word, ""And on your gates"" (<a href=""/9970#v9"">Deuteronomy 6:9)</a>. This implies that even structures which are not themselves ""homes"" should have <i>mezuzot</i> on their entrances."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.8",leading one to each other -," For example, a gate to a courtyard opens to a gate to an alleyway, which leads to a further alleyway, which leads to a courtyard...."

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.9",and a house on a ship -," Although the commentaries accept this law in principle, they question the Rambam's source. Among the possibilities offered are the <i>Midrash Tannaim, Parashat Va'etchanan</i>, and the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Megillah</i> 4:12.</p>
<p>The latter source compares <i>tefillin</i> to <i>mezuzah</i> and explains that the mitzvah of <i>tefillin</i> has an advantage, because it is fulfilled by those who travel in the desert or journey upon the sea.

<p>Indeed, the term <i>Amidah</i> - (lit. ""standing"") is used to refer to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> because of this requirement. (See <i>Soferim</i> 16:12.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.2,"if not, he may sit in his place and pray. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 30a relates a difference of opinion among the Sages whether it is preferable to recite one's prayers early, before the desired time so that one can stand during <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> or whether one should set out on a journey in a boat or carriage and pray at the appropriate time even though one will not be able to stand.</p>
<p>From this discussion, we may conclude that, under these circumstances, it is acceptable for one to remain seated during the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> if doing so will contribute to one's ability to concentrate."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.2,may pray even while lying on his side -," Note <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:2 which relates that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> lying on one's side, but not lying on one's back."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.2,"Similarly, one who is thirsty or hungry -", to the extent that he cannot concentrate
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.2,"[Therefore,] if he is able to concentrate properly he should pray, and if not he should not pray until he has eaten or drunk. -"," It is questionable whether this halachah is accepted at present, when, after the fact, prayer with a lesser level of concentration is accepted (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 101) and <i>siddurim</i> are commonly available (See <i>ibid.</i> 9:3)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.3,Facing the Temple: What is implied? A person standing in the Diaspora should face Eretz Yisrael and pray. -," <i>Berachot</i> 30a explains that this is derived from King Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the Temple (<a href=""/15892#v48"">I Kings 8:48)</a>: ""...and they will pray to You towards their land."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.3,One standing in Jerusalem should face the Temple. -," as implied by <a href=""/16555#v24"">II Chronicles 6:24</a> (which gives a slightly different account of Solomon's prayer): ""...and they will pray towards this House"" (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>
<p>The Talmud (<i>ibid.</i>) also relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Rav Avin... said: What is implied by the verse: ""Your neck is like the tower of David built with turrets (תלפיות) (<a href=""/16448#v4"">Song of Songs 4:4)</a>.""? A hill (תל) to which all mouths (פיות) turn.""</p>
<p>Thus, the Temple is called תל פיות, the hill to which all mouths turn in prayer."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.3,"A blind person, one who is -", in a new place and is...
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.3,should direct his heart towards the Divine Presence -," as implied by <a href=""/15892#v44"">I Kings 8:44</a>: ""...and they will pray to God"" (<i>ibid.</i>)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.4,"The preparation of one's body: What is implied? When one stands in prayer, he should place his feet together side by side. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 10b quotes <a href=""/16099#v7"">Ezekiel 1:7</a> which describes the angels as standing in the following manner: ""And their feet are a straight foot."" Therefore, when praying, we place our feet together in order to appear as angels - those expert in praising God."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.4,with the right hand clasped over the left hand -," The right side always represents the notion of lovingkindness; the left side, stern justice. Therefore, we hold our hands such that the right overpowers the left: i.e., lovingkindness overpowers stern judgement.</p>
<p>The right side is given prominence over the left in many other contexts because of this idea. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 2:4.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.4,"in fear, awe, and dread. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 30b bases this on <a href=""/16223#v11"">Psalms 2:11</a>: ""And you shall serve God in fear."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.5,"Proper clothing: What is implied? One should adjust his clothing and make himself neat and presentable before [praying], as [implied by <a href=""/16250#v2"">Psalms 29:2</a>]: ""They bow to God in resplendent holiness."" -"," <i>Berachot</i> 30b relates that, on the basis of this verse, Rav Yehudah would adjust his clothes before praying."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.5,bareheaded -," <i>Soferim</i> 14:15 states that one may not utter God's name with his head uncovered. (See also <i>Shabbat</i> 155b.) ""One praying must stand with his feet together and cover his head as one standing before the king"" (<i>Zohar, Va'etchanan</i> 260b)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.5,if it is the custom of the people of that place -," However, where it is normal practice to walk barefoot, as in particularly hot climates, it is permissible to pray that way (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.5,"However, he may pray holding his lulav on Sukkot, -", <i>Sukkah</i> 41b relates that Rav Ashi would pray with his lulav in his hand.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.5,If one is carrying a burden of less than four kabbim on his head -," This halachah quotes <i>Bava Metzia</i> 105b. See our commentary on Chapter 4, Halachah 6, for the modern equivalent of a <i>kav</i>."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.5,It is customary for all the Sages and their students to pray only when wrapped in a <i>tallit</i> -," <i>Shabbat</i> 10a relates that Rav Kahana would wrap himself in a <i>tallit</i> and pray. <i>Ta'anit</i> 20a also tells of Nakdimon ben Gurion, who when praying in the Holy Temple for rain, ""wrapped himself in a <i>tallit</i> and stood to pray."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.6,Proper place: What is implied? One should stand in a low place -," <i>Berachot</i> 10b bases this law on the premise, ""there is no loftiness before God, as [<a href=""/16351#v1"">Psalms 130:1</a>] states: 'From the depths, I call out to you, God.'”"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.6,"Also, one should open windows or doors -"," <i>Berachot</i> 31a states ""A person should always pray in a house with windows.""</p>
<p>In his responsum, the Rambam mentions that this halachah applies only to a house, as explicitly mentioned in the Talmud and not necessarily to a synagogue. However, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) quotes the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 251a), which requires a synagogue to have 12 windows, which correspond to the 12 <i>seraphim</i> in the Heavenly Court. He also quotes this law in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:4).</p>
<p>Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 34b) explains that windows are an aid to concentration, as one looks heavenward and is humbled. Rabbenu Yonah suggests that the light has a calming effect, allowing one to concentrate on his prayers."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.6,"as [<a href=""/16489#v11"">Daniel 6:11</a>] states: ""...and he had windows open in his room facing Jerusalem"" -"," The verse concludes: ""...and he kneeled on his knees three times a day and prayed."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.6,One should not pray in a destroyed building -," This halachah is derived within the context of the following narrative (<i>Berachot</i> 3a):</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Rabbi Yossi said: Once I was walking on the road and I entered one of the destroyed buildings of Jerusalem in order to pray. Eliyahu [the Prophet] of blessed memory came and waited for me by the entrance until I had finished praying.<br/>
After I finished my prayer, he greeted me: ""Peace unto you, Rebbe.""<br/>
I replied to him: ""Peace unto you, Rebbe and teacher.""<br/>
He asked me: ""My son, why did you enter this destroyed building?""<br/>
I answered him: ""To pray.""<br/>
He told me: ""You should have prayed in the road.""</p>
<p>The Talmud mentions that one should never enter a destroyed building on any account. Nevertheless, since the Talmud made this statement regarding Rabbi Yossi's prayer, the Rambam teaches the laws concerning destroyed buildings here in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.6,It is forbidden to sit down next to someone in the midst of the Amidah -," <i>Berachot</i> 31b refers to Chanah's prayers for a son and her subsequent remarks to Eli, the priest: ""I am the woman who stood here with you"" (<a href=""/15830#v26"">I Samuel 1:26)</a>. This verses indicates that Eli, as well as Chanah, was standing at the time.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Yonah also mentions that this applies only to a person sitting idly, but one studying or reciting the <i>Shema</i> need not worry and may continue to sit."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.7,One should not stand in a place three or more handbreadths high -," A handbreadth is the size of a fist: approximately 8 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>. Based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, anything lower than three handbreadths is considered to be part of the ground itself."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.7,"[Similarly, he should not pray while standing] on a bed, bench, or chair -"," The special mention of these objects requires explanation, since presumably, they would be included in the general category of a place three handbreadths or more high. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) quotes Rabbi Yitzchak Abuhav as suggesting that it is forbidden to pray while standing on these objects even if they are less than three handbreadths high. Even at this low height, a person may be unable to concentrate out of fear that he might fall.</p>
<p>The <i>Prisha</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) maintains that it is unlikely that a person would fear falling from such a low height and offers a different rationale. He explains that these objects constitute a separation between the person and the ground. In the Temple, the sacrificial service could be performed only while one was standing directly on the ground. Therefore, our prayers must be recited in a similar manner."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.7,is considered like an attic. -," i.e., it is considered a space in its own right rather than a raised area within a larger space."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.7,"Similarly, if it is surrounded by walls, even if it is not four cubits by four cubits, -"," though it lacks the necessary size, its walls cause it to be considered as an independent entity. Hence,..."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.8,Craftsmen -," who are hired to work for others by the hour or day, in contrast, to a person working on his own time."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.8,"or wall when the time of the Amidah arrives must descend in order to pray, -"," The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 16a) contrasts the <i>Shema</i> which these individuals may recite in their places and prayer, which requires that they descend. The difference is that, in the <i>Shema</i>, intense concentration is only required when reciting the first verse, while the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> should be recited with such intention. Hence, it is likely that in such precarious positions, the fear of falling will prevent a person from maintaining his concentration for this prolonged period. See also <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i>, Chapter 2, Halachah 4."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.8,"If they were at the top of an olive or fig tree, they may pray where they are because of the excessive effort [involved in descending]. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 16a differentiates between these trees and those of other species. Rashi explains that the danger of falling from these trees is minimal because of their thick branches, and, therefore, one may stand there firmly and pray.</p>
<p>The Rambam, based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 2:5, explains that the wide branches make the descent problematical, and, therefore, the workers may pray in the trees themselves."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.8,"If they are working for wages, they recite ""Give us understanding"" -"," i.e., the abridged version of the <i>Amidah</i>, discussed in Chapter 2, Halachot 2-4."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.9,Control of one's voice: What is implied? A person should not raise his voice during his Amidah -," <i>Berachot</i> 31a explains that these laws are derived from the description of Channah's prayer (<a href=""/15830#v13"">I Samuel 1:13)</a>: ""Channah spoke unto her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.9,"Rather, he should pronounce the words with his lips, whispering in a tone that he can hear -"," <i>Sotah</i> 32b relates: ""Why did they decree that the <i>Amidah</i> must be whispered? In order that those who have transgressed will not be embarrassed.""</p>
<p>Rashi explains that transgressors confess their sins before God during the <i>Amidah</i>, and, therefore, the Sages ruled that the entire <i>Amidah</i> should be recited in a hushed tone so that people would not feel embarrassed to confess."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.9,"unless he is sick or cannot concentrate otherwise, -"," When stating the abovementioned restriction, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that it can be relaxed in this eventuality."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.10,"Bowing, -"," The bows in the <i>Amidah</i> are intended to express the concept of complete abnegation of self (See <i>Tanya,</i> Chapters 39 and 42)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.10,"In the first blessing, at the beginning and at the end -"," i.e., one bows during the recitation of ברוך אתה at the beginning of the blessing and the recitation of ברוך אתה at the end."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.10,at the beginning and at the end -," i.e., at the recitation of the words מודים אנחנו לך (We are thankful to You) and the recitation of ברוך אתה at the end."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.10,while bowing -," <i>Yoma</i> 53b mentions that Rav Chiya, the son of Rav Huna, saw that Ravva and Abbaye took three steps backwards in the midst of a prolonged bow."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.10,"from his left and afterwards, from his right -", See Halachah 11 for the explanation of this halachah.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.10,"Then, he lifts his head up from the bowed position.<br/>",
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.11,Why should one take leave from the left first? -, as stated in the previous halachah
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.11,"i.e., just like when one stands before a -", mortal
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.12,and he makes himself like a bow -," <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) states that one should bow until he could see a coin placed opposite his heart. The Rashba explains that this refers to a coin that would be placed on the ground opposite one's heart. Thus, one should not bend over completely, but rather curve his back such that he can see the ground."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.13,"Prostrating, what is implied]? After one lifts his head from the fifth bow, he sits on the ground, falls with his face towards the earth, and utters all the supplications -"," <i>Megillah</i> 22b relates that the custom of falling to the earth in supplication was followed in Babylonia in Talmudic times.</p>
<p>The <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 131, explains that the reason for prostrating oneself after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is that by doing so, one prays in all three positions of prayer employed by Moses:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">sitting (during the verses of Praise), - ""...and I sat on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights"" (<a href=""/9973#v9"">Deuteronomy 9:9)</a>,<br/>
standing (during <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) - ""And I stood on the mountain as on the first day for 40 days and 40 nights"" (<a href=""/9974#v10"">Deuteronomy 10:10)</a>,<br/>
prostration - ""And I fell down before God, as at first, for 40 days and 40 nights"" (<a href=""/9973#v25"">Deuteronomy 9:25)</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshat BaMidbar</i>) explains that after prayer, a person should feel as if he has returned his soul to God and has no life-energy left. Thus, he falls to the ground where he receives new spiritual power."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.13,"""Kneeling"" always refers to [falling to] one's knees; -"," <i>Megillah</i> 22b derives this law from <a href=""/15892#v54"">I Kings 8:54</a>: ""And so it was when Solomon completed his Prayer to God... that he rose from kneeling on his knees."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.14,When uttering the supplication -," i.e., the prayer recited after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. In Hebrew, the Rambam uses the term נפילת אפים, which means literally ""falling on the face."" However, this translation is employed since the intent of ""falling on one's face"" is to recite these supplications."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.14,"It is forbidden to prostrate oneself on stones except in the Holy Temple, as we have explained in Hilchot Avodat Kochavim -"," Chapter 6, Halachot 6 and 7. There, the Rambam explains that it was a normal practice of idolators to place stones down in order to prostrate themselves upon them. He states that the Biblical prohibition - (<a href=""/9927#v1"">Leviticus 26:1)</a>: ""You shall not place a paved stone in your land to bow upon it"" - refers to השתחואה alone, as opposed to simply bowing, which although forbidden, does not obligate punishment. See also <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i>, Negative Commandment 12.</p>
<p>The Rambam also notes that prostration was permitted in the Temple, since the above verse mentioned only ""your land"". Similarly, because of this prohibition, it is customary to lie rugs or mats on top of the stone floors in most synagogues."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.14,"Rather, he should tilt his face slightly, but not press it to the ground. -"," <i>Megillah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) derives this law from the actions of Ravvah and Abbaye, who followed this practice instead of falling to the ground in accordance with the above rule.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 131:8) rules in accordance with the Rambam. The Ramah adds that no one should prostrate himself on the floor even if it is not stone. Therefore, the custom today is that everyone rests their heads on their arms while reciting <i>Tachanun</i>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.15,"It is an accepted custom among the entire Jewish people not to utter the supplication on Sabbaths or festivals. Nor [does one utter it] on Rosh Hashanah, Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah or Purim -"," This custom is also mentioned in the Siddur of Rav Saadia Gaon.</p>
<p>The days mentioned are all joyous occasions. At such times, we do not beseech God with extra supplication. Rather, we concentrate on the goodness that we have already received from Him. Similarly, we refrain from נפילת אפים at other occasions of joy; for example, a bride and groom on the day of their wedding and the week following it, and the participants in a ברית מילה (circumcision) are exempt from נפילת אפים. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim╟13 131:4.)<br/></i></p>
<p>or in Minchah on the eve of Sabbaths or holidays, - when the festive nature of these days can already be felt."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.15,"There are [however,] individuals who do utter the supplication in the Evening Prayer -"," <i>Otzar Geonim</i> on <i>Megillah</i> 23b discusses the various customs regarding the utterance of נפילת אפים.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.1",How is a <i>mezuzah</i> written? -, <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 15) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 423) consider the mitzvah of <i>mezuzah</i> to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.1",because one should not lower an article from a higher level of holiness -," As explained in Chapter 10, Halachot 2-5 (see also <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 11:14), the holiness of a Torah scroll surpasses that of all other articles."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.2","It is a mitzvah to leave a space between the passage, Shema, and the passage, V'hayah im shamo'a, as if it were s'tumah. - <i>S'tumah</i> means ""closed."" According to the Rambam, it refers to a passage whose first word is always written in the middle of a line in the Torah. See Chapter 8, Halachah 2. In the Torah, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> is <i>s'tumah</i>.",
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.2","it is acceptable, since these passages do not follow each other in the Torah. -"," Note the contrast between this ruling and the Rambam's decision in Chapter 2, Halachah 2, regarding <i>tefillin</i>: ""If one wrote a passage which should be <i>s'tumah</i> as <i>p'tuchah</i> or a passage which should be <i>p'tuchah</i> as <i>s'tumah</i>, it is unacceptable.""</p>
<p>The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32) explains the difference as follows: In <i>tefillin</i>, there are passages which follow directly after each other in the Torah. Therefore, all the passages must be written as they appear in a Torah scroll. In contrast, the two passages contained in a <i>mezuzah</i> do not follow each other in the Torah. Therefore, there is no absolute requirement for the passages to be written as they appear in the Torah."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.4","It is a common custom to write [G‑d's name,] Shaddai -"," This name serves as an acronym for the Hebrew words, שומר דלתות ישראל, ""Guardian of the gates of Israel"" (<i>Mishnat Chassidim</i>)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.4","There is no difficulty in this, since [the addition is made] outside. -"," See also the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 288:15) who states that it is also common to write the letters, כוזו במוכסז כוזו, opposite the words, י-ה-ו-ה א-להנו י-ה-ו-ה, on the outer side of a <i>mezuzah</i>. These letters are the letters which follow the letters in those names of God - i.e., the כ follows the י, the ז follows the ו."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.4",Not only do these fools nullify the mitzvah -," As stated in the previous halachah, any addition made on the inside of the <i>mezuzah</i> invalidates it. (Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 288:15 states that it is forbidden to add to the inside of the <i>mezuzah</i>, but does not explicitly say that the <i>mezuzah</i> becomes invalidated.)"
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.6",When [a <i>mezuzah</i>] is folded -," As the Rambam states, the intent is that the <i>mezuzah</i> be rolled. Folding a <i>mezuzah</i> is very undesirable, because it will cause the letters to crack."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.6","so that when a reader rolls it open, he will be able to read from the beginning of the line to the end -"," i.e., when one unrolls the <i>mezuzah</i>, the initial word of the line appears first."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.7","Before affixing it on the doorpost of the entrance, one should recite the blessing: -", as is done before the fulfillment of a positive commandment. This blessing should also be recited again when affixing a <i>mezuzah</i> which falls from the doorpost.

<p>The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid., states that if one fears that the <i>mezuzah</i> will be stolen or defaced, it may be placed within the door. It should, however, be placed on the back of the doorpost, but not on the wall next to the doorpost. (See also Chapter 6, Halachah 12.)"

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.11",would pay to have it affixed. -," Even if the tenant offers to pay the owner to find a <i>mezuzah</i> and affix it, the owner is not required to accept the offer. The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 291:2) adds that even if a person rents a house on the condition that it has <i>mezuzot</i>, and he discovers that they are lacking, he may not withdraw from the rental agreement on the grounds that the agreement was based on a misconception."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.11","When [the tenant] leaves [the dwelling, however], he should not take it with him -"," for leaving the house without a <i>mezuzah</i> leaves it open to undesirable influences (<i>Tosafot, Bava Metzia</i>, ibid.). Alternatively, removing a <i>mezuzah</i> may bring harm to the person who removes it (<i>Sefer Chasidim</i>)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.1","[There are requirements regarding] the s'chach of a sukkah, and not all substances are acceptable [to be used for this purpose]. -"," Some of the requirements mentioned by the Rambam were established by Torah law, while others are Rabbinic ordinances, as explained below."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.1",a) grows from the ground -," i.e., is an agricultural product and is neither found naturally - e.g., metals - nor produced from animals nor manufactured synthetically;"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.1",c) is not subject to contracting ritual impurity -," This excludes articles used as food and those that have been fashioned into utensils. These three requirements are alluded to by <a href=""/9980#v13"">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>: ""Make the Sukkot holiday for yourselves for seven days, when you gather in from your grain and grapes...""</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 12a explains that the verse implies that the <i>s'chach</i>, the essential element of the sukkah, must resemble ""the leftovers from the grain and grape harvest.""</p>
<p>(The expression ""alluded to"" was used rather than ""derived from"" on the basis of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:4. That expression implies that the concept cannot be derived from the verse per se. Rather, it was transmitted as a halachah l'Moshe miSinai, and the Biblical verse is merely an allusion.)</p>
<p>The Rambam gives examples of entities which are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> on the basis of these principles in the following halachah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2","When a person uses as s'chach a substance which does not grow from the ground, is still connected to the ground, or is subject to contracting ritual impurity, [the sukkah] is not acceptable. -", for these requirements stem from the Torah itself. The particular aspects of these requirements are described in this and the following halachot.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2",or possesses an unpleasant odor -, <i>Sukkah</i> 12b gives the plant known as wormwood as an example of such a substance.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2",[Our Sages] -, <i>Sukkah</i> 13a
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2",One must take care that the branches and leaves should not descend within ten handbreadths of the ground -," the minimum height for a sukkah prescribed in Chapter 3, Halachah 1."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2",when using the sukkah. -," The Rambam's phraseology leaves room for the interpretation that this is a suggestion, but not an absolute requirement. (See Rabbenu Manoach.) Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 633:9) states that such a sukkah is unacceptable for use."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2","bones, or hides -"," even if they have not been made into garments, but are still in a raw state in which they are unfit to contract ritual impurity;"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2","If one suspended vines and the like over it until they made a sukkah, it is unacceptable, because they were not uprooted [from the ground]. -", The laws governing the use of such plants as <i>s'chach</i> after they have been hung over the sukkah and then detached from the ground are discussed in Halachah 12.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2",mats that were made to lie on -," However, mats that were made for use as <i>s'chach</i> or for shade may be used as <i>s'chach</i>. Halachah 6 discusses the laws which apply when a mat was made without any specific intention."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2",and worn out -," e.g., garments that have worn out and are less than three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths in size and, hence, are no longer subject to contracting ritual impurity (<i>Sukkah</i> 16a; <i>Hilchot Keilim</i> 22:21)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2",Since these substances were subject to ritual impurity -," previously,"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.2",which have not yet attained a state of [unquestionable] purity -," i.e., are still subject to contracting ritual impurity."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.3",If one used foods -, This refers only to foods for humans. Food which is eaten primarily by animals is not subject to contracting ritual impurity (<i>Hilchot Tum'at Ochlin</i> 1:1) and hence may be used as <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Taz</i> 629:12).
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.3","[When one uses] branches from a fig tree which contain figs, runners from a grape vine which contain grapes, branches of a date palm which contain dates and the like -"," i.e., the difficulty being that although the branches are proper <i>s'chach</i>, the fruit is unfit to be used for that purpose..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.3",is more than the food -, the fruit
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.3",If one uses as s'chach vegetables -," The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this refers to vegetables that are used as animal food, and hence were not excluded by the previous clause of this halachah. Rabbenu Manoach and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 629:12) explain that this refers to vegetables that are eaten by humans. <i>Sukkah</i> 13b appears to support the latter interpretation, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vegetables with which a person can fulfill his obligation on Pesach... [can] invalidate a sukkah, [because they are considered] to be vacant space."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.4","If one used as s'chach branches of flax which were not crushed and combed, they are kosher, because they are still considered to be wood. -"," The use of the word עץ, rendered as branches or wood, with regard to flax, has its source in <a href=""/15786#v6"">Joshua 2:6</a>, which describes how Rachav ""hid them in branches of flax."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.4",it may not be used as s'chach -," Though it is not considered to be a garment and, hence, is not subject to contracting ritual impurity (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; see also <i>Shabbat</i> 27b), it may nevertheless not be used as <i>s'chach</i>..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.5",[The following rules apply] when one uses arrows as s'chach. -, The question whether the arrows are acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> or not revolves around another issue - their susceptibility to contracting ritual impurity.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.5",are kosher -," for the arrow itself is considered a simple wooden utensil which is not susceptible to contracting ritual impurity. (See <i>Hilchot Keilim</i> 1:10.)</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 629:2 states that this decision applies only before these arrows were placed in the arrowhead. If they have been placed in the arrowhead, even if subsequently removed they are no longer acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.5",are not acceptable. -, for they are subject to contracting ritual impurity.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.6","A mat of reeds, of raw rubber, or of hemp - if it is small, we may assume that it was made to lie on. -"," The commentaries note an apparent contradiction in the Rambam's words. <i>Hilchot Keilim</i> 25:13 states that even a small mat of reeds or hemp is not subject to contracting ritual impurity, because it is uncomfortable to lie on."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.6",If it is large -," The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Sukkah</i> 20a. It must be noted that his decisions are dependent on the version of the text of the Talmud he accepted. The Ra'avad and others interpret the word גדולה as related to the word גדיל (tassel). Thus, they explain that the Talmud is referring to a small mat. However, because it is made of thick tassels, rather than woven, it is not comfortable to lie on, and hence would most likely be used for shade. According to this opinion, any woven mat, even if it is large, is unfit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 629:6) quotes the Rambam's interpretation."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.6",If it has a border -, a small lip (<i>Sukkah</i> 20b)
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.7",Boards which are less than four handbreadths wide -," In many places throughout the Talmud, four handbreadths is established as the minimum size of an area. Hence, a board of that size is considered significant and may not be used as <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Sukkah</i> 14a)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.7","If they are more than four handbreadths wide, they should not be used as s'chach, even though they have not been planed. This is a decree [instituted] lest one sit under a roof and regard it as a sukkah. -"," A person might think: ""What is the difference between the sukkah and my house - they are both covered with boards?"" This is surely a false assumption. As explained in the following halachah, since the boards of a roof were not placed there for the purpose of shade, but rather to be part of the permanent structure of the house, they cannot be considered to be <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Sukkah</i> 14a; Rabbenu Manoach)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.7","However, one should not sleep under the board. -"," According to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, because it is part of the wall; according to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, because it appears to be a separate domain."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.8","A roof which is not covered by a ceiling - i.e., the plaster and the stones - but rather has only boards fixed in place, is not acceptable, since they were not placed there for the purpose of a sukkah -", as required by the following halachah
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.8",a) lifted up the boards -," from their place. (Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 631:9 does not mention this requirement, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 631:4 does.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.8",with the intent [that they serve] as a sukkah -, Therefore
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.9",A sukkah that was made for any purpose whatsoever - even if it was not made for the purpose of [fulfilling] the mitzvah - if it was made according to law -," <i>Sukkah</i> 8b quotes a <i>baraita</i> which contains the latter statement and questions: ""What does 'according to law' mean?...That it was made for the purpose of shade.""</p>
<p>It appears that the Rambam uses the same expression, but with different implications. Since he explicitly states that the sukkah must be constructed for the purpose of shade, one might infer that the expression ""according to law"" is intended to include other concepts. Thus, it can be a reference to the requirements for a sukkah's size and the nature of the materials used for the <i>s'chach</i>, as mentioned in this and the previous chapter."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.9","However, it must be made for the purpose of shade. -"," <a href=""/15935#v6"">Isaiah 4:6</a> states: ""It shall be a sukkah for shade from the heat...,"" thus defining the purpose of such a structure. A sukkah constructed for the purposes of modesty is not acceptable (Rabbenu Manoach)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.9","In contrast, a sukkah that came about on its own accord -"," e.g., branches fell over a frame, and of course, any time a roof is covered for other purposes - e.g., the construction of a home, as mentioned in the previous halachah..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.9","Similarly, when a person hollows out a place in a heap of produce and thus makes a sukkah, it is not considered to be a sukkah -"," <i>Sukkot</i> 12a explains that there is an added factor involved in this example. <a href=""/9980#v13"">Deuteronomy 16:13</a> states: ""Make a [celebration of] the Sukkot holiday for seven days."" This refers to the construction of the sukkah and teaches that we must ""make"" a sukkah and not use what was already made. Therefore, despite the fact that the person hollowed out the space for the purpose of shade, the sukkah is not acceptable, because the produce was not originally placed there for that purpose.</p>
<p>We find a similar principle concerning <i>tzitzit</i>. <a href=""/9986#v12"">Deuteronomy 22:12</a> states: ""Make yourself tassels on the four corners of your garments."" On the basis of this command, <i>Menachot</i> 40b teaches that it is unacceptable to tie <i>tzitzit</i> to a three-cornered garment and then cut a fourth corner, since we are required to make <i>tzitzit</i>, and not use what is already made."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.9","Accordingly, were one to create a space one handbreadth [high] -"," We find the measure of one handbreadth considered to define a structure with regard to the laws of ritual impurity. Accordingly, it is given significance in this context as well. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 16a.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.9","in area for the purpose of a sukkah, and afterwards hollow it out till it reached ten [handbreadths] -"," the minimum height of a sukkah, as explained in Chapter 3, Halachah 1."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.10","We may not use bundles of straw, bundles of wood or bundles of reeds as s'chach. -"," Although, according to the Torah's requirements, these would be considered proper <i>s'chach</i>..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.10","lest one place those bundles on one's roof to dry out, and then change one's mind and sit under them with the intent [that they serve as] a sukkah. The person did not place the s'chach there originally for the purpose of shade. Thus, it resembles a sukkah that came about on its own accord. -"," which is unacceptable, as explained in the previous halachah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.10","untied [the bundles], they are acceptable [for use as s'chach]. -"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 629:17) explains that a different rule applies if the bundles were originally placed on the roof to dry out. For them to be acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, untying them alone is insufficient, and one must also shift the position of their contents."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.11",Small bundles -," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the reason for the addition of the adjective, noting that if the bundles contain fewer than twenty five units, they are permitted, as stated in the previous halachah. Others mention that this refers to bundles of small branches."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.11",may be used as s'chach. -," <i>Sukkah</i> 13b relates that bundles of this nature were frequently used in Sura, and that the Sages permitted them to be used as <i>s'chach</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.11","Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as s'chach. A tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together naturally. -"," However, if one were to add even one branch and then tie them together, it would be considered to be a bundle (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 629:15)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.12",A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his home -," and the sukkah is unacceptable. This applies only when the shade the tree produces exceeds the open area. However, if there is more open space under the tree than shade, the sukkah may be kosher.</p>
<p>The determination of whether such a sukkah is kosher depends on a number of principles, based on the interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 9b and 11a. The Rambam's interpretation of that passage, and thus the ground rules he establishes, differ from those accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1-2).</p>
<p>In the following halachah, the Rambam deals with the resolution of the question when no effort has been made to correct the problem of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>. As will be explained, there his interpretation is contested by other authorities. In this halachah, the Rambam describes the rulings which govern the situation when an effort has been made to rectify the situation by detaching the branches from their source of nurture. These are based on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 11a, and are also accepted by other Rabbinic authorities. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:2.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.12",[the following rules apply:],
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.12",If the amount of s'chach which originally was kosher did not exceed [the branches] -," the presence of the branches remains halachically significant. Hence,..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.13",If one mixed a substance which may be used for s'chach with a substance that may not be used for s'chach -," This may refer to a substance like metal, which is unfit for use as <i>s'chach</i> because it does not grow in the earth, or branches of a tree which have not been detached from their source of nurture."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.13","the two as s'chach, even though the quantity of kosher s'chach exceeds that of the substance which was not acceptable as s'chach -"," The presence of the substance which is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is not nullified according to the principles of ברב ביטול, because it exists as a separate entity which can be distinguished from the kosher <i>s'chach</i>.</p>
<p>Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, notes the apparent contradiction between this decision and Halachah 3, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[When one uses] branches from a fig tree which contain figs,...We see if the waste is more than the food; then we may use them as <i>s'chach</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That halachah also mentions kosher <i>s'chach</i> - the branches - and substances which are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> - the figs. However, if there is a greater quantity of branches, the presence of the figs is nullified. In contrast, in this halachah, that concept is not applied.</p>
<p>Rav Avraham distinguishes between the two. In Halachah 3, the person does not intend to use the fruit for the purpose of shade; he merely wants to save the effort of removing it from the branches. Therefore, their presence may be nullified. In contrast, in this halachah the substances which are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> are being employed for the purpose of shade itself. Hence, their presence cannot be nullified."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.13",If one covered the sukkah with the two substances and kept them separate -," When there is a majority of kosher <i>s'chach</i>, it is judged to be an independent entity. When there is a sufficient amount of kosher <i>s'chach</i>, the sukkah is kosher unless the substance that is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is placed in a manner which can disqualify the entire sukkah, as is explained in this and the following three halachot."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.13",whether -, the substance which is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is placed...
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.14",Where does the above apply? In a small sukkah. -, See the commentary on both the previous and following halachot.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.14","where there is a substance that is unacceptable as s'chach in the middle, it disqualifies the sukkah if there are four handbreadths of it -"," across the entire span of the sukkah, dividing the sukkah in half, it is considered to be significant (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 17a), and hence the sukkah is disqualified.</p>
<p>The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 632:2) emphasizes that even where the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> is of this size, if the sukkah possesses seven cubits by seven cubits of kosher <i>s'chach</i> in one place, that portion may be considered to be a kosher sukkah and used during the holiday."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.14",the sukkah is kosher. -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 632:1) states that one may eat and sleep throughout the entire sukkah. However, the Ra'avad and Rabbenu Nissim do not accept this leniency, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (632:3) advises following this stringency."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.14","[If there is] less than that, the sukkah is kosher. -", on the basis of the principle of דופן עקומה explained below.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.14",b) a courtyard surrounded by an excedrah -," note the drawing accompanying Chapter 4, Halachah 8."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.14",c) a large sukkah over which was placed a substance that was not acceptable as s'chach near the sides of its walls. -," <i>Sukkah</i> 17a explains that one might not necessarily have been able to deduce this example from the previous ones, because in those instances only kosher <i>s'chach</i> was placed over the opening of those structures. In this instance, a substance that is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> was placed on the roof intentionally."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.14",and it is kosher. -," Though the sukkah as a whole is kosher, one may not eat or sleep under the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> if it is four handbreadths or more in size (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.). The rationale behind this decision is that the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> is considered to be part of the wall and not part of the <i>s'chach</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.15",What is a small sukkah? -, referred to in the previous two halachot and in Halachah 20
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.16","If one used as s'chach substances that were acceptable as s'chach and substances that were not acceptable as s'chach, and placed them alongside each other, leaving no place with non-kosher s'chach more than three handbreadths in area -"," so that even in a small sukkah, all the conditions mentioned in the above halachot are met, there is a further requirement before the sukkah is considered kosher."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.16","If there was an exactly equal amount of both substances, it is not acceptable -"," This decision has raised questions from all authorities. Though the Rambam's decision is based on <i>Sukkah</i> 15a, <i>Eruvin</i> 15b states that a divider whose open portion is as great as its closed portion is considered to be a divider. Indeed, the Rambam himself quotes that decision in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:16. If so, why does he not follow the same principle in this instance as well?</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's decision is based on the fact that there is no way that there will not be some tiny open spaces within the kosher <i>s'chach</i> of a sukkah. Accordingly, even if the kosher <i>s'chach</i> is equal in area to the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, the tiny spaces between the kosher <i>s'chach</i> will tip the balance in favor of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 631:8 quotes the Rambam's decision as halachah, but adds as a reason (a quote from Rabbenu Tam's text of <i>Sukkah</i> 15b): ""for it is impossible to be exact."" This implies that were it possible to know that the kosher <i>s'chach</i> is exactly equal to the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, it would be acceptable. See also commentary to Halachah 19."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.17",If one spread a cloth above [the s'chach] -, for added shade (<i>Sukkah 1:3)</i>
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.17",it is unacceptable. -," The cloth nullifies the presence of the kosher s'chach above or below it.</p>
<p>(<i>Tosafot</i> explains that as long as the sukkah has sufficient <i>s'chach</i> without the cloth, the cloth will not necessarily nullify the presence of the kosher <i>s'chach</i>. However, the majority of the halachic authorities and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 629:19 do not accept this view.)</p>
<p>However, once the cloth is lifted away, the kosher <i>s'chach</i> is acceptable without any further activity. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 626:3.) Thus, a roof can be constructed to protect a sukkah from rain, provided it is removed while the sukkah is being used."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.17","Similarly, if one covered the sukkah with s'chach as required by law and adorned it -"," Rabbenu Manoach emphasizes how the <i>s'chach</i> should be set in place before the decorations. Otherwise, they could be considered as intervening substances."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.18",Sukkah decorations do not reduce its height -," i.e., if the inner space of the sukkah is more than twenty cubits high and the sukkah is therefore not acceptable (Chapter 4, Halachah 1), the presence of the decorations is not considered significant to reduce that space to the legal requirements.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the sukkah is very low and the decorations reduce its inner space to less than ten handbreadths, it is still kosher. (See Halachah 2 with regard to branches.) They are considered to be part of the <i>s'chach</i>, and the space they take up is not taken into account (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Manoach)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.18",If the sukkah decorations are four handbreadths or more -," as mentioned frequently above, four handbreadths constitutes a significant space"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.19",The [following rules apply when the] s'chach has open spaces through which the sky can be seen: If the area of the open spaces is equivalent to -," and of course, if it is more than"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.19",the portion exposed to the sun will be greater than the shaded portion. -," <i>Sukkah</i> 22b explains that light spreads out. Accordingly, even though on the roof the portion covered by <i>s'chach</i> is equal to the uncovered portion, on the ground the area exposed to the sun will be greater than the shaded area. See also the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.20",When does the above apply? When there is no one open space -," To disqualify the sukkah, the empty space must extend across the entire span of the sukkah or create a place large enough for a person to stand in (<i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 17a; Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 632:2).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the sukkah area is more than seven handbreadths by seven handbreadths in addition to the open space, the remaining covered area of the sukkah is kosher."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.20","However, if there is an open space of three handbreadths - whether in the center -"," i.e., an empty space cutting the sukkah in two"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.20",it is unacceptable until one reduces [the space] to less than three.,
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.20",if the sukkah is large. -," The terms ""large"" and ""small"" are explained in Halachot 13-15."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.20",unless [the space] was reduced with a substance that is acceptable as s'chach.,
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.20",because -, when the sukkah is taken...
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.21",The proper way -," <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (631:5) uses the expression לכתחילה - i.e., one should set out to construct a sukkah in this manner."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.21","However, even though it is thick - like [the roof of] a house - and stars cannot be seen through it -"," The latter expression is quoted from the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:2."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.21",If the s'chach was uneven -," <i>Sukkah</i> 22a questions: ""What is the meaning of the word מדובללת used by the Mishnah?"" Shmuel (whom the halachah follows) replies: ""One reed going upward and one reed going downward."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.21",provided there is less than three handbreadths between the upper and lower [portions of the s'chach]. -," As explained previously, any distance less than three handbreadths is not significant because of the principle of <i>l'vud</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.21","or more wide, even though it is more than three handbreadths above [the lower portion], we consider it to be descending and touching the edge of the lower portion. -"," This principle, referred to by <i>Sukkah</i> 22a as חבוט רמי - literally, ""cast it down"" - is one of the leniencies followed as a halachah received from Moses on Mount Sinai. It allows this uneven roof to be considered to be a single straight entity. The same principle is also applied in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 15:25 and <i>Hilchot Tum'at Meit</i> 16:5."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.22","When a person constructs one sukkah on top of another sukkah, the lower one is unacceptable. -"," <i>Sukkah</i> 9b explains that the verse which commands us to dwell in sukkot (<a href=""/9924#v42"">Leviticus 23:42)</a> spells the word - סכת - omitting the letter ו, which is usually used. On that basis, the Sages explained that a single structure may be used for one sukkah, but not for two. Of the two, the lower sukkah is disqualified because..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.22","[However,] the upper one is kosher -", There is no reason that the presence of the lower sukkah should disqualify it.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.22",and the roof of the lower sukkah is strong enough to hold the pillows and covers of the upper sukkah -," Otherwise, the upper sukkah is not fit to dwell in. Though a sukkah is only a temporary dwelling, it must be fit to be used for all the purposes for which one uses one's home, as explained in Chapter 6, Halachah 5."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.22","However, if the inner space of the upper sukkah is less than ten handbreadths [high], or the roof of the lower sukkah is not strong enough to hold the pillows and covers of the upper sukkah, even with difficulty -"," and thus, is unfit to be used."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.22",the lower sukkah is kosher. -," for the reason that since its roof is of no functional purpose, it is not considered an intervening substance between the sukkah and the upper <i>s'chach</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.23",A bed [with a canopy placed] inside a sukkah: If [the canopy] is more than ten handbreadths high -," the minimum height for a dwelling to be considered to be an independent structure (<i>Sukkah</i> 20b).</p>
<p>In this and the following instances mentioned in this halachah, the ten handbreadths are measured from the ground to the canopy (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 627:2-3; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 627:5)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.23",for it is considered to be a sukkah -, with non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.23","Similarly, a canopy -", placed over a bed
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.23","If it is ten handbreadths high, one may not sleep -"," or perform any other activity required to be performed in a sukkah. (Perhaps the Rambam mentions sleeping because it is an activity that may be performed only within a sukkah. Even a short nap should not be taken outside the sukkah. In contrast, a snack may be eaten outside a sukkah.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.24","In contrast, should one spread a sheet over two pillars -"," <i>Tosafot</i> (ibid.) and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) differ with this decision as well, and explain that if these pillars are ten handbreadths high and permanently affixed to the bed, it is forbidden to spread a sheet over them."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.24",no matter how high they are -," i.e., even if they are more than ten handbreadths high."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.25",A borrowed sukkah is fit [to be used on the holiday]. -," Although, as stated in Chapter 8, Halachah 10, a person cannot fulfill the mitzvah of lulav as prescribed by the Torah with a lulav belonging to a colleague, that concept does not apply with regard to a sukkah.</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 27b explains the derivation of this concept as follows: <a href=""/9924#v42"">Leviticus 23:42</a> states: ""Every citizen of Israel shall dwell in sukkot."" The latter word is written סכת, implying one sukkah. This prompted our Sages to declare: ""All Israel are fit to dwell in a single sukkah.""</p>
<p>In his commentary, Rashi explains that the cost of such a sukkah would not be high enough to require every individual to pay a penny's worth. Hence, we must assume that some people would be using a borrowed sukkah, and, nevertheless, our Sages said that it was kosher."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.25","What does the latter imply? If a person attacked a colleague, forced him to leave his sukkah, stole it, and dwelled in it, the attacker has fulfilled his obligation, because landed property cannot be stolen. -"," <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 8:14 relates that ""landed property is never acquired by a thief, but rather remains in the possession of its owner forever.""</p>
<p>Since the sukkah is built on the land, it is considered part of the property and the above rule applies to it as well. Thus, the sukkah is still considered to be the property of its original owner and the thief is viewed as merely ""borrowing"" the sukkah from him. As mentioned above, use of a borrowed sukkah is permitted."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.25",because the Sages ordained that the owner of the wood is entitled only to the monetary worth of the wood -," but not the wood itself. Thus, the sukkah itself is the property of the thief. Though he is obligated to pay the owner for his wood, that obligation does not prevent the sukkah from being considered as his.</p>
<p><i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 1:5 explains this principle by stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who steals is obligated to return the stolen property itself... If it was lost or changed, he is obligated to return its monetary value...</p>
<p>Even if one steals a beam and builds a mansion [using it], since [the beam] has not been changed, the Torah law would require him to destroy the entire building and return the beam to its owner.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Sages instituted a decree [to encourage] those who repent; they ordained that all that is necessary is for him to return [the beam's] monetary value, and thus he will not forfeit his building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach asks: Since the mitzvah of sukkah is commanded by the Torah, and Torah law regards these boards as stolen, how can the Sages' decree change their status in this context?</p>
<p>He explains that, as implied by the principle הפקר הפקר בית דין, the Torah has granted the Sages the right to determine the status of property. Their decree can alter entirely a person's rights to its title. Thus, in the present case, since Rabbinic law entitles the thief to use of the boards, he is permitted, according to Torah law, to use them as a Sukkah.</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (637:5) writes that if the thief refuses to pay for the wood, it is considered to be the property of its original owner, and the thief does not fulfill his obligation."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.25",If a person constructs his sukkah in the public domain -," Though the Jewish inhabitants of the city would surely not object to use of public property for this purpose, the gentile inhabitants of the city would. Since they also have a share in this property, building a sukkah there is equivalent to stealing from the public (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 637:3).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, since the theft of land is involved..."
Blessings 10.1,The Sages -," In Chapter 1, Halachah 5, the Rambam attributed the composition of the text of all the blessings to Ezra and his court, the <i>Anshei K'nesset Hagedolah</i>."
Blessings 10.1,and many other statements -, See Halachot 19-25.
Blessings 10.1,and a chatimah -," The words, ""Blessed are You, God,"" which are used to conclude blessings. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i>, <i>ibid.</i>)"
Blessings 10.1,"for example, the blessings of prayer that we have already mentioned. -"," See <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i>, Chapter 7, which mentions the morning blessings."
Blessings 10.1,or buys -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 223:4) states that the blessing should be recited when the article is purchased, and not when it is first used. One feels greater satisfaction when purchasing the article than when using it."
Blessings 10.1,articles -," i.e., garments or household goods (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 223:13). This blessing should be recited only on the acquisition of important articles, whose purchase brings one considerable satisfaction. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:6) and <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>)."
Blessings 10.1,[This blessing is recited] regardless of whether one possesses -," According to the Rambam, this refers to articles acquired through inheritance. If one has already purchased such an article, he should not recite a blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:3, based on the decisions of Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher), however, states that the blessing should be recited even when he had purchased such articles before."
Blessings 10.2,"Similarly, a person who sees a friend -"," <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 58b, states that this refers to a friend who is dear and whose sight brings one satisfaction."
Blessings 10.2,for] thirty days [or more] -, Thirty days is considered a significant period regarding various matters of Scriptural Law.
Blessings 10.2,"If he sees him after a hiatus of twelve months [or more], he should recite the blessing ""Blessed are You, God... -"," Although the <i>Panim Me'irot</i> states that the words ""our Lord, King of the universe"" need not be mentioned, the consensus of halachic opinion (see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 225:3) is that they should be recited."
Blessings 10.2,A person who sees -," Although from <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 29:2, it is clear that the blessing should be recited whether he eats the fruit or not, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 225:3) states that it is customary to recite the blessing before partaking of the fruit."
Blessings 10.2,that grows only in a specific season each year -, The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 225:6) states that the blessing should be recited even if the fruit has two seasons a year in which it grows. The intent is to exclude fruits and vegetables that grow throughout the year.
Blessings 10.3,When a person hears favorable tidings -," This halachah is complemented by Halachah 7, which explains that the blessing <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i> is recited when the positive nature of the tidings effect others as well as oneself. If the favorable tidings are individual in nature, the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> should be recited. The Rambam mentions <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i> in this halachah, because he is referring to - although not quoting exactly - the text of the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 9:2."
Blessings 10.3,"If he hears bad tidings, he should recite the blessing: ""Blessed [are You...] the true Judge.'' -"," This blessing has the implication that, although one personally feels upset over the event, he realizes that since everything is controlled by God and He is ""the true Judge"":</p>
<p>a) the occurrence, however tragic, was just,<br/>
b) ultimately, it is intended for the good. God, who is truly good, cannot be the source of evil."
Blessings 10.3,over undesirable occurrences with a positive spirit in the same manner as he joyfully recites a blessing -, <i>shehecheyanu</i> or <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i>.
Blessings 10.3,that we were commanded [to express] -," Loving God is one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. (See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:1-2.) The verse cited above is the proof-text for that commandment. Thus, the mitzvah to love God includes this ""extra dimension of love."""
Blessings 3.1,There are five species [of grain] -," As will be explained, there are special laws regarding the blessings recited before and after food made from these species of grain. These five species are also mentioned in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:1."
Blessings 3.1,rye -," This is the accepted translation. There is some difficulty, however, in accepting it, since rye was not commonly grown in the Mediterranean region. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Kilayim</i> 1:1, the Rambam defines כוסמין as ""wild wheat."""
Blessings 3.1,and spelt. -," In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that this grain resembles כוסמין. [For this reason, there are commentaries which interchange the translations of כוסמין and שיפון.]"
Blessings 3.1,"When these five species are in their stalks, they are referred to as tevuah. After they have been threshed and winnowed, they are referred to as grain. -"," Here, also, although these statements have other halachic implications (e.g., <i>Challah</i> 1:2 mentions these points within the context of vows: if a person vows not to benefit from <i>tevuah</i> or grain, he is forbidden to benefit from these species), the Rambam is defining these terms here because he will refer to them throughout this chapter."
Blessings 3.2,Before eating bread -, made from the five species of grain mentioned in the previous halachah
Blessings 3.2,"Afterwards, he should recite the four blessings [of grace] -", discussed in the previous chapter.
Blessings 3.2,a person should recite the blessing borey pri ha'adamah -," the blessing recited for eating vegetables and other products of the earth (Chapter 8, Halachah 1).</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 37a states, ""A person who chews [kernels of] wheat should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>."" Even though the grain has been cooked, since the kernels were not processed at all, it does not warrant a blessing of greater importance (<i>Kessef Mishnah</i>).</p>
<p>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:3-6 discusses the question of grains that are cooked whole, but are cooked for a long period until their shell dissolves. There are authorities who recommend that unless the kernels have been cooked to the extent that they stick together as a single mass, whole grains should be eaten only in the midst of a meal containing bread. See also Halachah 4."
Blessings 3.2,Before eating flour -, which has not been cooked
Blessings 3.9,Before partaking of dough baked over the ground -," Significantly, the Rambam's definition of the term כובא דארעא, discussed by our Sages, <i>Berachot</i> 38a, differs from that of Rashi, whose interpretation is quoted in the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:15)."
Blessings 3.9,one should recite the blessing borey minei mezonot -, and not <i>hamotzi</i>
Blessings 3.9,"If, however, one uses it as the basis of a meal, -"," Based on <i>Berachot</i> 42a, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:6) interprets this to mean ""a measure that others would usually use as the basis for a meal even though, personally, one is not satisfied from it.""</p>
<p>Quantitatively, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 168:8 states that the intention is a full meal, an <i>isaron</i>. [He arrives at this calculation as follows: In the desert, the Jews received an <i>omer</i> of manna for two meals each day. An <i>omer</i> is twice the quantity of an <i>isaron</i>.] This is approximately 22 <i>k'beitzot</i>, or 1266 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 1452 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>. This figure includes not only the grain product, but also other foods - e.g., meat, fish, or vegetables - that are eaten together with it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are more stringent opinions, and accordingly, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 168:24 suggest not eating a meal consisting of more than four <i>k'beitzot</i> of food with such ""bread"" as its base."
Blessings 3.9,"Similar [laws apply to] dough that was kneaded with honey, oil, or milk -"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:7) states that all that is necessary is to mix enough of these ingredients into the dough so that their taste is felt. The Ramah and the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:16 differ and maintain that the amount of these ingredients must exceed the quantity of water used. Support for their ruling can be drawn from the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:20.</p>
<p>The above is significant with regard to what is popularly called today <i>mezonot</i> bread, which is produced by using apple juice instead of (or together with) water. According to the Ramah, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should not be recited:<br/>
a) if the dough is made with more water than juice,<br/>
 b) if one uses this bread as the basis for a large meal."
Blessings 3.9,and baked -," producing a product which, like cake, is generally eaten for pleasure and not as the basis of a meal."
Blessings 3.9,"Although it [resembles] bread, the blessing borey minei mezonot is recited over it -"," because it is not food which, like bread, is the foundation of our diets."
Blessings 3.10,Before eating rice -," In this halachah, we have translated אורז as ""rice"" and דוחן as ""millet,"" based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shvi'it</i> 2:7. There is, however, debate concerning this manner among the halachic authorities. Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 37a) and the Maharil interpret אורז as ""millet."" With respect to these opinions, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 208:9 and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 208:11 suggest partaking of rice or millet only in the midst of a meal including bread. If either are eaten separately, the blessing <i>shehakol</i> should be recited beforehand because of the doubt involved.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <i>Sha'ar Tziyun</i> 208:31 rules that the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited before partaking of rice. He explains that there are opinions that the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited on all satisfying food. Since rice serves this purpose, it can be given this blessing."
Blessings 3.10,or bread made from rice -," In contrast, before eating kernels of rice, one should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> as is done before partaking of kernels of grain. (See Halachah 2 and <i>Berachot</i> 37a.)"
Blessings 3.10,"Afterwards, the blessing borey nefashot should be recited. -"," Although rice is a satisfying food, it is not one of the five species of grain. Hence, neither grace nor <i>al hamichyah</i> is recited after partaking of it. See also the following halachah."
Blessings 3.10,"In contrast, before eating bread made from millet -"," Rabbenu Asher and many other Ashkenazic authorities differ with the Rambam and maintain that since millet, like rice, is a sustaining food, it warrants the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>. Nevertheless, the<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:8) and the later authorities follow the Rambam's opinion. Note, however, the difference of opinion on the definition of the terms אורז and דוחן mentioned above."
Blessings 3.10,one should recite the blessing shehakol. -," Although all<i>kitniyot</i> grow from the ground, the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> is recited only when one eats them cooked as vegetables, and not when they have been ground into flour and baked into other foods, since this is not the normal manner in which they are eaten (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 208:12)."
Blessings 3.11,Whenever the blessing hamotzi is recited before [partaking of a food] -," i.e., when one eats bread or enough of other grain substances to warrant the recitation of <i>hamotzi</i>, as mentioned in Halachah 9."
Blessings 3.11,"a single blessing, which includes the three [blessings of grace], is recited afterward -"," This blessing contains the three primary elements of the first three blessings of grace, an expression of thanks to God for granting us sustenance, for granting us <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and for granting us Jerusalem. The full text of this blessing is quoted in Halachah 13."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.1,It is a positive commandment of the Torah," — <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 21)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.1,the miracles and wonders wrought for our ancestors in Egypt on the night --," In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.), the Rambam states ""the beginning of the night,"" implying that we should begin telling the story of the Exodus in the first portion of the night."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.1,"as [<a href=""/9874#v3"">Exodus 13:3</a>] states: ""Remember this day --", the fifteenth of Nisan
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.1,"just as [<a href=""/9881#v8"">Exodus 20:8</a>] states: ""Remember the Sabbath day."" --"," This addition is a quote from the <i>Mechiltah</i> and <i>Shemot Rabbah</i>. Nevertheless, the commentators have questioned its necessity. Some explain that the word זכור does not follow the grammatical form usually used for commandments, and hence the comparison with the Sabbath is valuable.</p>
<p><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 21, explains that <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> states that the remembrance of the Sabbath is זכר למעשה בראשית, ""a commemoration of the work of creation."" The remembrance of the exodus, it continues, must also emphasize the wonders and miracles that God performed.</p>
<p>What is the common point between the Sabbath and the exodus? Both emphasize how God is above nature and, hence, can change nature according to His will.</p>
<p>This quality is also reflected in our service. At the very beginning of <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how the observance of the Sabbath is connected with a positive mitzvah: rest. A Jew steps beyond his weekday activities and devotes his energies to spiritual activites bond with God.</p>
<p>Similarly, the recollection of the exodus from Egypt must take us beyond our everyday activities to the extent that as stated in Halachah 7:6 ""He presents himself as if he, himself, is leaving the slavery of Egypt."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.1,saying: 'It is because of this...' --," The <i>Mechiltah</i> interprets this as a reference to matzah and maror. Thus, the verse is"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.1,[is to be fulfilled] when matzah and maror are placed before you --," i.e., on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan, when it is a mitzvah to eat matzah, as explained in Halachah 6:1."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.1,Even great Sages are obligated to tell about the Exodus from Egypt. --," to quote the Haggadah: ""Even if we are all wise, all men of understanding, all Sages, all knowledgeable about the Torah, it is a mitzvah incumbent upon us to relate the Exodus from Egypt."" Many commentaries explain that the story the Haggadah quotes concerning Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, and the other Sages is brought to demonstrate and prove this point."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.2,"It is a mitzvah to inform one's sons even though they do not ask, as [<a href=""/9874#v8"">Exodus 13:8</a>] states: ""You shall tell your son."" --"," Though <a href=""/9874#v14"">Exodus 13:14</a> states: ""And it shall come to pass that your son will ask you:...,"" the verse quoted demonstrates that the father's explanations need not necessarily come in response to his son's questions (<i>Mechiltah d'Rashbi</i>)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.2,"How is this applied? If the son is young or foolish, he should tell him: ""My son, in Egypt, we were all slaves like this maidservant or this slave. On this night, the Holy One, Blessed be He, redeemed us and took us out to freedom."" --"," To this author's knowledge, this phraseology is the Rambam's original choice of words. He attempts to provide us with an easily applicable example of how to fulfill this mitzvah."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.3,He --, the father or person conducting the seder
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.3,and will --," thus, remain awake and"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.3,"until he replies to them: ""This and this occurred; this and this took place."" --", relating the story of the Exodus by reciting the Haggadah.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.3,the table should be taken away before they eat --," <i>Pesachim</i> 115b relates that one Pesach, Abaye was sitting before Rabbah, and the latter suddenly picked up the table as if he had finished eating. Abaye exclaimed: ""We have not begun to eat and you have already picked up the table!"" (See also <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 473:6. See Halachah 8:2.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.3,and the like --, The custom of pouring the second cup of wine directly after reciting הא לחמה עניא is cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.:7) as another practice instituted to arouse curiosity.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.3,"If he does not have a wife, [he and a colleague] should ask each other ""Why is this night different?"" This applies even if they are all wise --", as mentioned in the previous halachah.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.4,One must begin [the narrative describing our ancestors'] base [roots] and conclude with [their] praise. --," This principle is taken from the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a. The commentaries offer several rationales in its explanation. Among them:</p>
<p>a) The contrast between our nation's humble roots and the majestic level they reached through the Exodus make us more conscious of God's great kindness (<i>Tosefot Rid</i>).</p>
<p>b) Mention of our roots prevents us from becoming overly haughty (<i>Maharshah</i>)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.4,our ancestors denied [God's existence] --," The Rambam is alluding to the passage ""Originally, our ancestors were idol-worshipers."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.4,One concludes with the true faith --, The redemption from Egypt representing the birth of the Jews as a nation and the beginning of their service of God as a people.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.4,"Similarly, one begins by stating that we were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and [describing] all the evil done to us --"," The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 116a, which mentions a debate between Rav and Shmuel concerning the interpretation of ""One must begin [the narrative describing our ancestors'] base [roots] and conclude with [their] praise.""</p>
<p>Rav maintains that it is proper to begin from ""Originally, our ancestors were worshipers of idols,"" placing the emphasis on our degrading spiritual roots. Shmuel (according to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, Ravvah) maintains that we should begin from ""We were slaves to Pharaoh, stressing the humble material origins from which our people stem. Customarily, we follow both opinions in our recitation of the Haggadah (Rav Yitzchak Alfasi), and hence the Rambam includes both opinions in this halachah.</p>
<p>There is, nonetheless, a certain difficulty with the Rambam's statements. All texts of the Haggadah begin with ""We were slaves,"" and then relate the passage ""Originally, our ancestors were idol worshipers."" Here, the Rambam reverses that order. Perhaps he made this choice because the Talmud uses this order when mentioning these two opinions. Alternatively, chronologically, our ancestors' worship of idols preceded the Egyptian exile."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.4,This [implies] that one should extrapolate --, bringing other verses to explain and clarify the statements of this passage as found in the Haggadah.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.4,until one concludes the entire passage. --," i.e., until <a href=""/9990#v8"">Deuteronomy 26:8</a>."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.5,Whoever does not mention these three matters on the night of the fifteenth has not fulfilled his obligation --," to relate the story of the Exodus. The commentators question if a person who does not mention these three concepts is not considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah at all, or rather, is the intent that he has not fulfilled the mitzvah in a desirable manner?"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.5,the Paschal sacrifice: [It is eaten] because the Omnipresent passed over the houses of our ancestors in Egypt --, saving them from the plague of the slaying of the firstborn
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.5,The bitter herbs --," Here and in Halachah 8:4, the Rambam changes the order found in our text of the Mishnah and in the Haggadah (including even his own text of the Haggadah). Rabbenu Manoach maintains that this was the order found in the Rambam's text of the Mishnah."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.6,"In each and every generation, a person must present himself"," — <i>Pesachim</i> 116b explains that the mitzvah of relating the story of the Exodus cannot remain on the intellectual level alone. Rather, it must affect a person to the extent that he personally feels that he is leaving Egypt.</p>
<p>There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements. <i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.), the commonly accepted text of the Haggadah, and even the Rambam's own text of the Haggadah, read לראות (see himself), and not להראות (present himself) — i.e., show others that he feels this way. Why does the Rambam alter the text here?</p>
<p><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XII, notes that the following halachot emphasize how the obligation of recalling the Exodus applies, not only to the recitation of the Haggadah, but to all the practices performed on Pesach. Since we must recite the Haggadah to others, as implied by the question-and-answer approach required by Halachah 3, the manner in which a person performs all the other Passover practices must also demonstrate to others his personal experience of the Exodus."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.6,left the slavery of Egypt --," Here, also, the Rambam alters the text, adding the words ""the slavery."" Since the Rambam is addressing people who may never have seen the physical land of Egypt, it is not possible to demand that they feel as if they left that country, but rather, that they left backbreaking slavery as experienced by our people in Egypt."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.6,"us out from there."" --"," This verse is quoted by Ravvah, <i>Pesachim</i> 116b.

He also must try to recline to the best of his ability - e.g., leaning on a colleague's side. See <i>Magen Avraham, Orach Chayim</i> 472:3."

<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, Orach Chayim 472:7, writes that a person who ate matzah or drank from the four cups of wine without reclining is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation and must repeat the act.</p>
<p>The Ramah qualifies this law, explaining that since, in the Ashkenazic community, certain opinions do not require reclining at present, one need not drink another cup of wine if the third and fourth cups of wine were drunk without reclining. However, he suggests that a person repeat the eating of matzah and the drinking of the first two cups of wine if they were consumed without reclining. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (and the subsequent authorities) declare that the drinking of the first cup should also not be repeated."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.8,"if one reclines, it is praiseworthy --"," for, as mentioned in the previous halachah, reclining is one of the signs of freedom and liberation, and thus, has an importance of its own, independent of its connection to the eating of matzah and the drinking of the four cups of wine."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.9,These four cups [of wine] should be mixed with water so that drinking them will be pleasant. --," In Talmudic times, the wines were very strong and had to be mixed with water before being drunk. At present, most commercially produced wines have already been diluted with water. Nevertheless, in many communities, it is customary to mix a small amount of water with the wine when pouring the cup, to fulfill the obligation of mixing the wine with water oneself."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.10,"On each of these four cups, one recites a blessing of its own --"," i.e., one recites the blessing בורא פרי הגפן, blessing God for creating wine, before partaking of each cup of wine. Generally, when one continues drinking wine in one sitting, only one blessing is recited in the beginning. However, in this instance, since each of the four cups was ordained as a specific mitzvah, it requires a blessing of its own.</p>
<p>The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> quotes Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, as stating that after each of the four cups, his father also required the recitation of the blessing על הגפן (the blessing recited after drinking wine). Nevertheless, both Sephardic and Ashkenazic custom today is to recite על הגפן only once, at the end of the Seder (Ramah 474:1)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.10,"on the first cup, one recites the kiddush pertaining to the day --"," as on every Sabbath and festival, as stated in Halachah 8:1."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.11,The charoset is a mitzvah ordained by the words of the Sages --," This statement represents a change of opinion by the Rambam. <i>Pesachim</i> 10:3 states: ""The <i>charoset</i> is not a mitzvah. Rabbi Eliezer ben Tzadok declares: 'It is a mitzvah.' In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Rabbi Eliezer ben Tzadok, who maintains that <i>charoset</i> is a mitzvah, one is obligated to recite a blessing ""...who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the eating of <i>charoset</i>."" This is not the halachah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A change of opinion of this nature is not extremely uncommon. However, the question can be raised: why does the Rambam not require a blessing to be recited over the <i>charoset</i>? Among the answers given is that the <i>charoset</i> is considered secondary (טפל) to the substances which are dipped in it. Hence, we follow the principle of reciting a blessing upon the essential item (the maror or the matzah) and not on the <i>charoset</i> (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>)."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.12,"According to the Torah, the eating of bitter herbs is not a mitzvah in its own right --"," In contrast to matzah, concerning which there is a separate commandment (<a href=""/9873#v18"">Exodus 12:18)</a>: ""On that evening, eat matzot,"" there is no specific Biblical commandment to eat bitter herbs alone.</p>
<p>Rav Chayim Soloveitchik explains that, accordingly, when eating the maror together with the Paschal sacrifice, there is no obligation to eat a</p>
<p>כזית. That measure is required only according to the Sages, who established a separate mitzvah to eat maror. Therefore, as in all other cases where eating is required, one must consume a כזית. However, since there is no Torah mitzvah to eat maror, merely that one should use it to embellish the Paschal sacrifice, that measure is not required by the Torah.</p>
<p>[Perhaps, this thesis may be questioned on the basis of Halachah 8:6, which requires a separate blessing for maror when it is eaten alone. As in Halachah 8:2, a blessing would not be required on a measure less than a כזית.]"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.12,It is one positive commandment to eat the meat of the Paschal sacrifice together with matzah and bitter herbs. --," Just as the four species taken on Sukkot are one mitzvah, similarly, although the Paschal sacrifice should be eaten with these three elements, it is considered only one mitzvah.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 56), the Rambam explains that if it is impossible to obtain bitter herbs, it is still a mitzvah to partake of the Paschal sacrifice. However, there is no mitzvah to partake of bitter herbs alone. (See also <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 8:2.)"

Just as the Egyptian exile began in a favorable way and ended in bitter oppression, similarly the leaves of this plant are sweet, but its root bitter. Furthermore, its Aramaic name, חסא, also means compassion and alludes to God's mercy for our people. From a halachic perspective, it is easiest to consume the required measure of maror when using this species."

However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (473:11) maintains that the main root extending from them stem may also be used.

Many have the custom of using horseradish as maror, but soak it before the Seder to minimize its sharpness. Based on this halachah, it is preferable for them to use one of the less bitter species of bitter herbs than to follow this practice."
Fasts 1.1,It is a positive Torah commandment -," See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 59), which mentions this in the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</p>
<p>Significantly, however, the Rambam's appreciation of this mitzvah differs in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. To explain: Following the verse quoted here by the Rambam as a proof-text, the Torah continues [<a href=""/9938#v10"">Numbers 10:10</a>]: ""On the days of your rejoicing, on your festivals, and on your new moon [celebrations], you shall sound the trumpets for your burnt offerings and for your peace offerings.""</p>
<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are commanded to sound the trumpets in the Temple when offering sacrifices that are offered only at appointed times.... [Also,] we are commanded to sound the trumpets at a time of distress and difficulty when we pray to Him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (and similarly in <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 384), the emphasis of the mitzvah is clearly on the sounding of the trumpets during the sacrifices. In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, when listing the 613 mitzvot at the beginning of the text, the Rambam mentions the sounding of the trumpets both for the sacrifices and in times of distress. Nevertheless, further on in the beginning of the text, when delineating the mitzvot according to subjects, he places the emphasis on crying out to God at a time of distress (seemingly, including crying out verbally and crying out with the trumpets in the same mitzvah). Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 3, where the Rambam mentions the practice of sounding the trumpets in connection with the offering of the sacrifices, he does not mention it as a component of this or any other specific mitzvah.</p>
<p>(Note also the commentary of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, which questions why these two different rites were included as a single mitzvah at the outset. Even in the Torah, they are included in two separate verses.)"
Fasts 1.1,and to sound -," The verb להריע refers to the sounding of a series of staccato notes referred to as <i>teru'ah</i>. See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:2-4. Significantly, although in practice, both types of notes were sounded, with regard to the sounding of the trumpets at the offerings, the Torah uses the verb ותקעתם, which refers to sounding a <i>teki'ah</i>, a single long note."
Fasts 1.1,"in the event of any difficulty that arises which affects the community, as [<a href=""/9938#v9"">Numbers 10:9</a>] states: ""[When you go out to war...] against an enemy who attacks you and you sound the trumpets...."" -"," As obvious from Halachah 4, this practice was observed throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and not only in the Temple. Nor is its observance dependent on the existence of the Temple, nor does the Rambam specify that it must be fulfilled only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (In this regard, there are differing opinions; see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:1) Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:1 questions: Why is the rite of sounding the trumpets (or shofarot) not observed at present?</p>
<p>The resolution of this question lies in the Rambam's words, ""any difficulty that arises which affects the community."" This rite should not be observed when an individual, or even a group of individuals, are in distress, but only when a ""community"" is affected.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> 54b explains that communal fasts are possible only within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There is no concept of taking such a unified communal act of this nature in the diaspora. Therefore, this mitzvah was not relevant in all the generations of our people's existence in the diaspora. (See also the <i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i> of the Ramban.)</p>
<p>A question arises, however, with regard to the situation at present, with the renewal of the Jewish settlement in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 11, there are opinions (see the gloss of the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> to the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575) that maintain that at present, the concept of community also applies in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</p>
<p>According to this view, without entering into the discussion regarding the halachic status of the present government, it would appear that it would be proper for this mitzvah to be observed, since its observance is not dependent on the Temple."
Fasts 1.1,"rather] the intent is: Whenever you are distressed by difficulties - e.g., famine, plague -"," Note <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b, which states that the trumpets should not be sounded in the case of a plague even during the week. Since a plague is a very severe matter, were the trumpets to be sounded during the week, they might also be sounded when a plague took place on the Sabbath, and thus a prohibition would be violated. The Rambam discusses this question in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:3). Similarly, in Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Rambam rules that the trumpets are sounded when a plague occurs."
Fasts 1.2,This practice is one of the paths of repentance -," Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Temurah</i>, where the Rambam writes that although all the mitzvot of the Torah are Divine decrees and thus unfathomable in nature, we should meditate upon them and, to the fullest extent of our potential, try to explain them. Similarly, with regard to the mitzvah under discussion, without claiming to be able to fathom it in its entirety, the Rambam gives a rational explanation for the practice."
Fasts 1.2,"that [the difficulty] occurred because of their evil conduct, as [<a href=""/16002#v25"">Jeremiah 5:25</a>] states: ""Your sins have turned away [the rains and the harvest climate]."" -"," See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 9:1, where the Rambam explains that God has instituted a cycle of causation into the world in which performing a mitzvah brings an individual - or a community - blessing and prosperity, which enable them to perform more mitzvot. Conversely, the failure to observe mitzvot brings about misfortune, which, in turn, makes it even harder to observe mitzvot."
Fasts 1.3,"Conversely, should the people fail to cry out [to God] and sound the trumpets, and instead say, ""What happened to us is merely a natural phenomenon and this difficulty is merely a chance occurence"" -", Rather than seeing their difficulty as part of a Divinely structured plan to motivate their repentance.
Fasts 1.3,which causes them to remain attached to their wicked deeds -, for they refuse to pay attention to the external cues God gives to motivate repentance.
Fasts 1.3,"This is implied by the Torah's statement [<a href=""/9927#v27"">Leviticus 26:27</a>-28]: ""If you remain indifferent to Me, I will be indifferent to you with a vengeance."" - מקרה, the Hebrew for ""chance occurrence,"" shares the same root as קרי, ""indifferent."" Thus",
Fasts 1.4,In addition -, to the obligation to cry out and sound the trumpets incumbent upon us from the Torah
Fasts 1.4,whenever there is a difficulty that affects the community -, These difficulties are listed in Chapter 2.
Fasts 1.4,"On these fast days, we cry out in prayer, offer supplications, and sound the trumpets -", blow a series of <i>teru'ah</i> notes
Fasts 1.4,"In the Temple, we sound both the trumpets and the shofar. -"," From the Mishnah (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 3:3), it would appear that two shofarot were sounded together (<i>Minchat Chinuch</i>)."
Fasts 1.4,for the mitzvah of the day is with the trumpets. -, Note the contrast to <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 1:2.
Fasts 1.5,These fasts ordained for the community because of difficulties should not be consecutive -, day after day.
Fasts 1.5,the community would not be able to observe such a practice. -," And an ordinance for the community is not instituted unless it is possible for the majority of the community to observe it (<i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 2:5). Were a communal ordinance that could not be observed by the majority of the community to be instituted, the people's observance, not only of that particular ordinance, but of the Torah as a whole, would be weakened."
Fasts 1.5,"on the subsequent Thursday, and on the subsequent Monday. -"," Mondays and Thursdays are days associated with significant spiritual influences. Also, in this manner, the fasts are separated from each other and from the Sabbath.</p>
<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:9), the Rambam explains that communal fasts should be held first on Mondays, because were they to be held on Thursday, the shopkeepers would assume that the possibilities for famine are great - for otherwise why would a public fast be instituted before the Sabbath - and they would raise the prices of foodstuffs.</p>
<p>(This rationale differs slightly from Rashi's interpretation of the Mishnah. Significantly, many of the traditional commentaries on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> do not mention the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah. See the <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>.)"
Fasts 1.6,"A communal fast should not be decreed on a Sabbath, nor on a festival -"," for the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>The <i>Merchevat HaMishneh HaSefaradit</i> raises a question regarding this statement. From the previous halachah, it would appear that a communal fast is ordained only on Mondays and Thursdays, and from this halachah one might assume that, since it is necessary to exclude the Sabbath, such a fast might be ordained for other days.</p>
<p>In resolution, it is explained that the previous halachah refers only to the thirteen communal fasts instituted when the rains fail to descend. When a difficulty of another nature arises, a fast may be instituted on a day other than Monday or Thursday. Alternatively, it can be explained that if the difficulty is not a matter of immediate emergency, the fast is put off for a Monday, as mentioned above. In the case of an immediate emergency, however, a fast may be held on any day other than those mentioned in this and the following halachah."
Fasts 1.6,The [only] exceptions are -," See also Chapter 2, Halachah 2, which states that we should cry out in prayer, even on the Sabbath, if our source of sustenance is threatened."
Fasts 1.6,"[In these instances, and indeed,] even when a single individual is being pursued by gentiles, by thieves, or by an evil spirit -"," i.e., he loses control of his behavior and may harm himself (Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b)"
Fasts 1.6,"cry out [to God], and offer supplications on their behalf in prayer. -"," <i>Ta'anit</i> 14a states that this refers to the addition of the prayer <i>Anenu</i>. According to the authorities who maintain that we may fast on the Sabbath (and even according to some who forbid fasting), this refers to the blessing <i>Anenu</i> added to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>). According to the other opinions, it refers to the seven blessings mentioned in Chapter 4 that begin ""May He who answered... answer you"" (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>)."
Fasts 1.6,for them -, as an expression of prayer to arouse God's mercies.
Fasts 1.7,"Similarly, at the outset, a fast should not be ordained on Rosh Chodesh, -"," Rashi (<i>Ta'anit</i> 15b) cites <a href=""/9938#v10"">Numbers 10:10</a> as an indication that Rosh Chodesh is described as ""a festival."" As such, it is inappropriate for a fast to be held on such a day."
Fasts 1.7,or Chol HaMo'ed. -," Although it is a logical addition, it must be noted that Chol HaMo'ed is not mentioned in the source for this halachah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 2:10, nor is it mentioned in the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 572). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 572:2) quotes the Rambam's ruling."
Fasts 1.8,"Pregnant women, nursing women -", lest their fetus or child be endangered by the lack of nourishment.
Fasts 1.8,need not fast -," Nevertheless, as mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, they should not indulge in food and drink for the sake of pleasure."
Fasts 1.8,"[With regard to these fasts,] even though we are required to fast during the day, we are allowed to eat on [the preceding] night, with the exception of the fasts instituted for [a lack of] rain, as will be explained -"," in Chapter 3, Halachot 3 and 5."
Fasts 1.9,"Just as the community should fast because of distress, so too, each individual should fast [when confronted by] distress. -"," The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this as an obligation. Not only is fasting advisable for a person as a means to secure Divine favor, it is an obligation incumbent upon him."
Fasts 1.9,"lost in the desert, or imprisoned, one should fast for his sake -"," Significantly, the Rambam mentions fasting on behalf of another person. Surely, one should fast for one's own sake if that is possible. In many situations, however, were a person who confronts distress to fast, he would lack the strength to cope with the crisis he is facing. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 571:3.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <i>Ta'anit</i> 8b gives advice regarding such a situation as well, counselling one to vow to fast in the future. This will be considered as if the person fasted already, as implied by <a href=""/16493#v12"">Daniel 10:12</a>, ""From the day on which you first <i>considered</i>... fasting before your Lord, your words were heeded."""
Fasts 1.9,in -, the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i> in
Fasts 1.10,"Whenever an individual did not accept a fast [on the previous day] before sunset, it is not considered to be a fast. -"," <i>Ta'anit</i> 12a describes a person who fasts without having made such a commitment to be ""a bellows full of air"" - i.e., he receives no reward for refraining from eating. Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who questions why such a person does not receive at least the reward of an hourly fast, as mentioned in Halachah 13.</p>
<p>He explains that since the person desired his fast to be considered as a full day fast, it is impossible for him to receive the merit of an hourly fast. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 562:42.)"
Fasts 1.10,"one states, ""Tomorrow I will fast,"" and resolves to do so. -"," From the Rambam's statements, it appears that a mental resolve is not sufficient. This is borne out by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 563:1). Note the ruling of the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 563:3, which state that, after the fact, it is sufficient to have made a mental resolve for one's commitment to fast to be binding."
Fasts 1.10,"Similarly, if one resolved to fast for three or four days consecutively and accepts such a fast upon oneself, the fact that one eats each night does not detract from his fast -", provided that in the daylight hours one refrains from eating.
Fasts 1.12,A person who has a disturbing dream must fast -," i.e., the Rambam sees this as an obligation. Other authorities differ, as mentioned in the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:18."
Fasts 1.12,He should undertake such a fast even on the Sabbath -," <i>Berachot</i> 31b states that a person who fasts on the Sabbath will cause a decree of seventy years standing against him to be rent.</p>
<p><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 288:3 explains that such a person is allowed to fast on the Sabbath, because the disturbing nature of his dream will prevent him from appreciating the Sabbath pleasures. It is fasting and not indulgence that will bring such a person satisfaction.</p>
<p>Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 288:5) explains that at present, it is customary to fast on the Sabbath only for certain disturbing dreams, since we are not as aware of the proper interpretation of dreams as were the Sages of the previous generations."
Fasts 1.12,[This applies] even though he did not resolve on the previous day to fast. -, This is the only exception to the rule mentioned in Halachah 10. The positive influences aroused by fasting are most effective immediately after the disturbing dream (<i>Ta'anit</i> 12b).
Fasts 1.13,A person may fast for several hours -," i.e., although a person did not undertake a full day fast, the fact that he refrains from eating for several hours can be considered to be a fast. Although his merit is less than that of a person who undertakes and completes a full day fast, he still receives reward for his conduct."
Fasts 1.13,What is implied? A person was involved with his affairs and tended to his concerns without eating until noon or until three in the afternoon. -," Although the person actually fasted for the entire day, it is considered only an hourly fast, since he did not make a commitment on the previous day."

Fasts 1.16,"was fasting because of a distressing situation, and the distress passed, or because of a harsh decree and the decree was nullified: -"," The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 569:5 quotes a difference of opinion among the Rabbis whether the leniency to be mentioned applies if the prayers of the community were not answered, but the reason for which they are fasting ceases to become relevant. For example, the people were fasting for the recovery of a sick person and he died."
Sabbath 9.4,"When one person brought fire, another brought wood -"," The Rambam's ruling is based on <i>Beitzah</i> 34a and the <i>Tosefta, Shabbat</i> 12:4. There are, however, slight differences between the wording chosen by the Rambam and the wording of those sources. Furthermore, the Talmud implies that the person who brought the fire is liable, not for performing a derivative of the labor of cooking, but for the labor of kindling. (See Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) This is definitely not the Rambam's intent.</p>
<p>In resolution of this difficulty, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes his teacher, Rav Ya'akov bei Rav, who explains that the first clause describes a situation in which all the individuals performed their act virtually simultaneously, with a shared intent. Hence, since the end result of their activity is the performance of a forbidden labor, all are held liable as if they had performed the labor themselves."
Sabbath 9.4,another added water -," Even those who do not accept the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> would hold such a person liable, since a person is liable for heating water, as explained in Halachah 1."
Sabbath 9.4,another put in spices -," Since the spices contribute flavor to the food, adding them to the pot is sufficient to make one liable for cooking, even according to the opinions that do not accept the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>."
Sabbath 9.4,"all are liable for cooking, since anyone who performs an activity that is necessary for cooking is considered as [having performed that forbidden labor].","</p>
<p>If, by contrast, one put down the pot, another came - According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this is the key phrase in understanding the difference between the first clause and the second. ""Another came"" - i.e., he came after, and without any connection, to the first individual. Hence, the responsibility is not shared by the entire group. Accordingly, since the actions of the persons mentioned first could not bring about cooking in their own right, they are not held liable."
Sabbath 9.4,another came and placed wood on the fire -," Once the wood begins to burn, the fire will have the potential to cook the meat. Hence, the person who brings it is liable."
Blessings 2.1,This is the order of the blessings of the grace after meals: The first blessing [thanks God for providing our] sustenance; -," <a href=""/9972#v10"">Deuteronomy 8:10</a> states: ""When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless God, your Lord...."" <i>Berachot</i> 48b states that this command obligates us to recite the blessing thanking God for our sustenance."
Blessings 2.1,"The third blessing [praises God as] ""the builder of Jerusalem""; -"," <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets the modifier ""good"" in the above verse as a reference to Jerusalem and the Temple. This allusion implies an obligation to add a blessing thanking God for these gifts."
Blessings 2.1,"The first blessing was instituted by Moses, our teacher -<i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) explains that Moses instituted this blessing when the manna descended. The manna serves as a clear sign of God's beneficence in granting sustenance to His creations.",
Blessings 2.1,the third by King David -," who solidified the kingdom of Israel and conquered Jerusalem. He instituted the blessing thanking God, ""for Israel, Your people, and Jerusalem, Your city"" (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>)."
Blessings 2.2,"When workers are employed by an employer and eat a meal of bread, they should not recite a blessing before eating. -"," The obligation to recite the blessing before eating is Rabbinic in origin. In certain situations, the Sages did not institute such a requirement."
Blessings 2.2,so that they do not neglect their employer's work. -," From this we learn two concepts:<br/>
a) that it is forbidden to work while reciting grace (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 2:5; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 183:12);<br/>
b) how important it is for a worker to devote himself faithfully to his work. See the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i>."
Blessings 2.2,"In the second blessing, they should begin with the text of the blessing for Eretz Yisrael, include aspects of the blessing for the building of Jerusalem -"," One should recite:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">We offer thanks to You, God, our Lord, for having granted our ancestors a precious, good, and spacious land, and Jerusalem, Your city. May You rebuild it speedily in our days (Rabbenu Manoach).</p>
<p>It may be presumed that one should also include the aspects of the second and third blessings that Halachot 3 and 4 consider as absolute requirements (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>)."
Blessings 2.2,"If they do not receive a wage, but only meals in return for their services - their responsibility to their employer is less, and they are required to recite all the blessings.",
Blessings 2.3,The blessing for Eretz Yisrael should include an acknowledgement of thanks [to God] at its beginning and at its conclusion. -," In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam relates that this blessing begins, ""We offer thanks to You, God, our Lord..."" and states, shortly before its conclusion, ""For all these, God, our Lord, we give thanks to You."" An omission of the second mention of thanks, however, does not require the repetition of grace (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 187:4)."
Blessings 2.3,"Whoever does not include the phrase ""a precious, good, and spacious land"" -"," This expression is a combination of the praises of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> mentioned in <a href=""/16000#v19"">Jeremiah 3:19</a> and <a href=""/9864#v8"">Exodus 3:8</a>."
Blessings 2.3,A person must mention the covenant [of circumcision] -," Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 48b) explains that the mitzvah of circumcision is connected with God's promise of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to Abraham, as <a href=""/8212#v8"">Genesis 17:8</a>-10 states: ""I will give you and your descendants... the entire land of Canaan.... You shall keep My covenant.... Circumcise every male."""

Blessings 2.12,[The following rules apply when a person who is reciting grace] on a Sabbath or a festival [concludes the third blessing -," More precisely, mentions God's name in the conclusion of the third blessing. If he remembers his omission before he mentions God's name, he should add the special passage, and then repeat <i>Uvneh Yerushalayim</i>. Once he mentions God's name, however, he should complete the blessing, ""<i>boneh Yerushalayim. Amen,</i>"" and then add the blessing mentioned below."
Blessings 2.12,If he remembers before he begins the fourth blessing -," <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 188:9 interprets this to mean: before he mentions even a single word of the blessing. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 188:23, however, differs and maintains that even after mentioning God's name, one may still continue, ""who has granted rest...."""
Blessings 2.12,"Blessed [are You, God...] -"," Our text follows the position of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who emphasizes that this blessing contains God's name and the phrase ""King of the universe,"" as do other blessings. This view is not shared by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and several other commentaries, who point to the fact that neither <i>Berachot</i> 49a nor the Rambam explicitly mentions God's sovereignty. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) shares the <i>Lechem Mishneh's</i> position."
Blessings 2.12,"On the festivals: Blessed [are You, God...] who has granted festivals to His people Israel for rejoicing and for happinesss. Blessed are You, God, who sanctifies Israel and the seasons. -"," The sanctification of the festivals is dependent on the Jews, who fix the monthly calendar. (See <i>Beitzah</i> 17a.)"
Blessings 2.12,"If he [does not] remember [the omission of the special passages until after] he begins the fourth blessing, -"," i.e., even if he merely mentions the first word, <i>Baruch</i>, as explained above"
Blessings 2.13,[The following rules apply when a person who is reciting grace] on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> [concludes the third blessing and] forgets to recite Ya'aleh v'yavo -, as required in Halachah 5:
Blessings 2.13,"he should recite the following: ""Blessed [are You, God...] who granted <i>Rashei Chadashim</i> to His people Israel as a remembrance.""","</p>
<p>The blessing does not include a chatimah. - Many blessings begin: ""Blessed are You, God, King of the universe...,"" and conclude, ""Blessed are You, God...."" The latter concluding phrase is referred to as a <i>chatimah</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:7.)</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions that the Sages were unsure of whether this blessing should include a <i>chatimah</i> or not. Therefore, to avoid the possibility of mentioning God's name in vain, the <i>chatimah</i> is omitted."
Blessings 2.13,If he remembers -, the omission
Blessings 2.13,[without making any additions]. He need not repeat [the entire grace]. -," <i>Berachot</i> 49b explains that although in prayer (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 10:10), the omission of <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> warrants a repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> its omission does not warrant a repetition of grace. The difference between the two is that prayer is an obligation, while eating a meal of bread is not. Since there is no obligation to recite grace on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>, failing to mention it in grace is not sufficient cause to warrant its repetition."
Blessings 2.13,[When a person reciting grace] on Chanukah or on Purim forgets to mention the uniqueness of the day in grace -," <i>Al hanisim</i>, as mentioned in Halachah 6."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.1,"Moses, our teacher, ordained that the Jews should read the Torah publicly on the Sabbath -"," See also Chapter 13, Halachah 8."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.1,"Ezra ordained that [the Torah] should be read during the <i>Minchah</i> service on the Sabbath, because of the shopkeepers. -"," The Hebrew, יושבי קרנות, literally means ""those who sit on the street corners."" Our translation is based on Rashi's commentary (<i>Bava Kama</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>). He explains that during the week, these people were involved with their businesses and could not attend the Torah reading. Therefore, Ezra instituted a special Torah reading for them on the Sabbath, when work is prohibited.</p>
<p>Rav David Arameah interprets the phrase literally, explaining that on the Sabbath, since work is prohibited, people would gather in the afternoon in the marketplace, and spend their time in idle conversation. Therefore, Ezra ordained the public Torah reading to draw them into the synagogue."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.1,people should read -," In Talmudic times, the person called to the Torah would read from the Torah himself. Our custom of having one reader is discussed in the commentary on Halachah 17."

However, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 574) explains that the laws concerning the reading of the Torah and the <i>haftarah</i> are discussed primarily in this and the following chapter of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. Hence, the decision here should be followed and the <i>haftarah</i> should not be recited."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.3,The Torah is never read in public in the presence of fewer then ten adult free men. -," See Chapter 8, Halachot 4-6."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.4,"[When] three people read ten verses: Two read three [verses each] and one, four [verses]. It is praiseworthy regardless of whether the one who read four [verses] is first -", for the most important person is called to the Torah first (<i>Megillah</i> 21b).
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.5,Each one of the readers opens the Torah scroll and looks at the place from which he is to read. -," <i>Megillah</i> 32a mentions a difference of opinion between Rabbi Yehudah, who maintains that the blessings for the Torah should be recited while the Torah scroll is open (as quoted by the Rambam), and Rabbi Meir, who maintains that the Torah scroll should be closed, lest the people err and think that the blessings are written in the Torah.</p>
<p>Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 139:4) quotes the Rambam's decision, the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> explains that Rabbi Yehudah maintains that one is not obligated to close the Torah scroll before reciting the blessing. However, there is nothing wrong in doing so. Therefore, in many communities the custom is to roll the Torah closed before reciting the blessing.</p>
<p>Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>, 140:3) regarding the ruling when one looks at the wrong passage in the Torah before reciting the blessing."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.6,"The person reading the Torah is not allowed to begin reading until the congregation ceases responding ""Amen"" -"," so that their recitation of ""Amen"" will not drown out the Torah reading. Today, in communities where the Torah is read by a person other than the one reciting the blessings, it is customary for the reader to prolong his recitation of ""Amen"" slightly, so that everyone will know when the Torah reading begins (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 141:17)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.6,[the reader] is forced to repeat [the reading] until he reads it correctly. -, This applies even if one has already read other verses or even recited the blessing over the verse which was read incorrectly (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 142:2).

He should begin from the place where the one who lost the ability to speak began -"," In his responsa, the Rambam cites the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:3) to explain why this law differs from the law mentioned in Chapter 10, Halachah 4, which states that if a <i>chazan</i> cannot continue the recitation of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, the person who replaces him begins from the point where he left off. The Rambam explains that it is necessary for the second person reading the Torah to repeat the verses, because otherwise, the verses read by the initial reader will not be included in the concluding blessing."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.13,He should not read fewer than twenty-one verses [as the <i>haftarah</i>]. -," Since an <i>aliyah</i> has a minimum of three verses, the twenty-one verses of the <i>haftarah</i> will parallel the seven <i>aliyot</i> of the Torah reading (<i>Megillah</i> 23a)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.13,"If he read only ten verses, but the <i>haftarah</i> is translated, it is sufficient even if the concept is not completed. -"," Rabbenu Nissim explains that after the final verse is translated, one should repeat the verse in its original to conclude with the words of the prophet.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.20,"He calls the members of the community, one by one, and they ascend -"," to the platform on which the Torah is read. Hence, the name <i>aliyah</i> (ascent) is used to refer to a person called to the Torah."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.20,recites Kaddish -," half-<i>Kaddish</i>. The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Soferim</i> 21:6. It is our practice to recite <i>Kaddish</i> after the Torah reading and then, again, as an introduction to the <i>Musaf</i> prayers."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.20,On days when the <i>haftarah</i> is read and there is a <i>Musaf</i> service -," i.e., Sabbaths and festivals"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.21,"During the <i>Minchah</i> service on the Sabbath and on Yom Kippur, after the leader of the congregation completes Tehillah l'David and the order of Kedushah -"," i.e., <i>U'va l'Tzion</i>. See Chapter 9, Halachah 13. On Yom Kippur, it is our custom to recite these prayers before the <i>Ne'ilah</i> service, and not before <i>Minchah</i>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.21,and takes out a Torah scroll. -," The congregation should stand while the Torah scroll is being taken from the ark (<i>Kiddushin</i> 33b). <i>Soferim</i> 14:14 states that the congregation should walk after the Torah scroll while it is being taken from the ark to the reading platform and when it is returned.</p>
<p>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 149:1) mentions the custom of training children to kiss the Torah scroll as it is taken out."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.21,The leader of the congregation] recites Kaddish -, half-<i>Kaddish</i>
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.21,"Similarly, on a fast day -", after the recitation of<i>Tehillah l'David</i> and half-<i>Kaddish</i>
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.21,"Afterwards, Kaddish is recited -", a half-<i>Kaddish</i>
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.22,[When the Torah is read on] a day when <i>Musaf</i> is not recited -," i.e., on Mondays and Thursdays, Purim, Chanukah, and fast days"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.22,[the leader of the congregation] recites the Kaddish -, half-<i>Kaddish</i>
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.22,The leader of the congregation] recites Tehillah l'David and the order of Kedushah - <i>U'va l'Tzion</i><br/>,
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.22,"[Afterwards,] he recites the Kaddish -"," the full <i>Kaddish</i>, to indicate the completion of the service."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.23,"in synagogues, as a token of respect for the community -"," i.e., it is proper that a community possess a complete Torah scroll. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 3:1) states that this prohibition was instituted so that the community would be upset that they were prevented from hearing the Torah readings, and therefore buy a Torah scroll. (See also Chapter 11, Halachah 1.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.23,"Therefore, if it is necessary to read two separate concepts, two Torah scrolls are taken out. -"," See Chapter 18, Halachot 22-24."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.24,When a person rolls a Torah scroll [closed] -," Apparently, in Talmudic times, one person would both lift the Torah up and roll it closed. (This practice is followed today among Chabad Chassidim.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.24,"When he ties it, he should tie it from the inside. - <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) explains that if the knot is on the outside, when the Torah scroll is opened it would have to be turned over to be untied.<br/>",
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.24,"[in the center], so that it will not rip. -"," i.e., if the Torah scroll is torn because one person pulled one <i>etz chayim</i> (one of the rods on which the Torah scroll is mounted) from the other, the scroll will tear on the stitching and not on the text."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.24,is not allowed to leave until the Torah scroll is taken. -," The <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 149, interprets <i>Sotah</i> 39b, the source for this prohibition, as forbidding one to leave from the same exit through which the Torah will be taken, but allowing one to leave through another exit, because it is improper for a person to walk in front of the Torah scroll.</p>
<p>The Rambam does not allow this leniency, since abandoning the Torah does not show respect. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 149:1) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> opinion."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.1,The essence of the commandment [forbidding] the worship of false gods is not to serve any of the creations -," The Rambam counts the prohibition against worshiping false gods as the first of the 365 negative commandments. In these halachot, he does not mention this prohibition in the manner in which he usually introduces one of the 613 mitzvot in this text, because he introduced this prohibition previously in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, mentioning it in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:6. The inclusion of this mitzvah in those halachot is appropriate, because it is one of the foundations of our faith."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.1,none of the four fundamental elements -," fire, wind, water, and earth. The Rambam describes the existence and function of these four fundamental elements in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapters 3 and 4."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.1,Even if the person worshiping knows that ‘ה is the [true] God and serves the creation in the manner in which Enosh and the people of his generation worshiped [the stars] originally -," as the Rambam mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 1."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.1,This -," should not be interpreted simply as forbidding us to gaze at the celestial beings (<i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, Negative Commandment 10), but rather"
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.1,having been apportioned by God to all the nations to be alive -," See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 3:9, which states that the stars and the spheres are alive and are conscious of God's existence."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.1,"Therefore, you might say that it is worthy to bow down to them and worship them -"," to ""honor those who God honors,"" as mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 1, or to derive benefit from serving them, as mentioned in Halachah 2 of that chapter.</p>
<p>For this reason, [<a href=""/9975#v16"">Deuteronomy 11:16</a>] commands: ""Be very careful - The words ""Be very careful"" imply a prohibition stemming from the Torah. In Halachah 3, the Rambam describes the prohibition involved in harboring such thoughts."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.2,"The worshipers of false gods have composed many texts concerning their service, [describing] what is the essence of their service, what practices are involved, and what are its statutes. -", The commentaries have also included studying other books by pagans and nonbelievers in this prohibition.
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.2,nor to think about them or any matters involved with them. -," The <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. I, 100a, mentions this prohibition together with its rationale, ""lest your heart be tempted to this service."""
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.2,"as [<a href=""/9920#v4"">Leviticus 19:4</a>] states: ""Do not turn to the idols."" -"," Note the comments of the <i>Sifra</i> on this verse, ""If you turn to them, you will make them gods."""
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.2,"""[Be careful]... lest you seek to find out about their gods, saying, 'How did they serve them.' -"," See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 10), which defines this prohibition as ""analytical thought and study concerning the fantasies and empty thoughts of the founders [of idol worship] - i.e., that spiritual nurture can be drawn down from this star in this manner, it is proper to burn incense to this star in this manner...."""
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.2,serve them. -, These enquiries are prohibited because
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,All these prohibitions -, mentioned in this and the above two halachot.
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,Whoever performs a deed -," e.g., in his curiosity, uncovers an image to see what it looks like (Maharshal) or performs a ceremonial act of idol worship merely as practice (<i>Mishneh Kessef</i>).</p>
<p>The Rambam's statements here are used as support to negate the opinion of the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 345), which states that lashes are never given for the violation of a prohibition that can be transgressed without performing a deed, even when one violates it by committing a deed."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,The worship of false gods is not the only subject to which we are forbidden to pay attention -," Note the Introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), which states that there are mitzvot of thought, of feeling, of speech, and of deed."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,"[Accordingly,] were a person to follow the thoughts of his heart, it is possible that he would destroy the world because of his limited understanding. -"," There are several ways to understand the expression used by the Rambam: ""destroy the world."" On the most obvious level, it is a figurative expression, not to be interpreted literally. On a deeper level, it can be seen as a reference to his statements in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:4 that a person should always ""see himself and the entire world as equally balanced between merit and sin. If he commits one sin, he tips his balance and that of the entire world to guilt and brings on destruction.""</p>
<p>Today, we can appreciate the Rambam's words in a very literal sense. Society as a whole is plagued by irrational acts of violence. and on a global level it is possible for utter destruction to be brought about if a few individuals act irresponsibly."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,and -, there are
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,[He may also wonder:] -," <i>Chaggigah</i> 11b states: ""It would have been better for someone who considers the [following] four matters never to have been created."" The passage continues by mentioning the four questions quoted by the Rambam here."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,"Similarly, [one may wonder about] prophecy: Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not? -"," In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 7:1, the Rambam states: ""It is [one] of the foundations of [our] faith that God communicates by prophecy with man."" Similarly, the Rambam lists the concept of prophecy as the sixth of his Thirteen Principles of Faith."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,"Since he might not know the guidelines with which to evaluate [ideas that will lead him] to the truth in its fullness, he might come to heresy. -"," The Rambam's statements should be interpreted, not as a restriction of one's thinking processes, but rather a call to structure our thoughts according to the guidelines provided for us by the Torah.</p>
<p>In this context, it is worthy to refer to <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">I maintain that it is not proper for a person to stroll in the <i>Pardes</i> (study Torah's mystic secrets) unless he has filled his belly with bread and meat. ""Bread and meat"" refer to the knowledge of what is permitted and what is forbidden, and similar matters concerning other mitzvot. Even though the Sages referred to these as ""a small matter"" - since our Sages said: ""'A great matter,' this is <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah</i>. 'A small matter,' this is the debates of Abbaye and Ravva"" - nevertheless, it is fitting for them to be given precedence, because they settle a person's mind.</p>
<p>Thus, the Rambam teaches that a person should not embark on the study of deep spiritual questions until he has gained the intellectual maturity which comes from Torah study. Even after a person gains such maturity, there is no need for him to concern himself with the study of idol worship because there is no value which he can derive from such study."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,"i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth. -"," Instead, he should follow a structured pattern for intellectual growth and development prescribed by a Torah master."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,"[interpreted this warning]: ""After your hearts,"" this refers to heresy -"," For a more precise definition of the term <i>minut</i>, see Halachah 5 and the commentary."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,"This prohibition - though [severe,] causing a person to be prevented [from attaining a portion] in the world to come -"," In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam includes among the categories of those who have no portion in the world to come: ""nonbelievers, heretics, those who deny the Torah,... those who cause the many to sin, and those who depart from the ways of the community."" Following the whims of one's heart can lead to the transgression of these prohibitions."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.4,"The commandment [forbidding] the worship of false gods is equivalent to all the mitzvot, as [implied by <a href=""/9943#v22"">Numbers 15:22</a>]: ""Lest you err and not perform all the mitzvot...."" -"," The passage implies that it is speaking about a single sin; nevertheless, the verse specifically mentions ""all the mitzvot."""
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.4,teaches that the verse refers to -, a single prohibition which is equivalent to the violation of the entire Torah. Which prohibition is that?
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.4,"Thus, we learn that anyone who acknowledges a false god denies the entire Torah in its totality, all the works of the prophets, and everything that has been commanded to the prophets -"," Note the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 8:1-2, which explain that the essence of the prophetic tradition is linked to the revelation of God on Mount Sinai."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.4,"until eternity, as [<a href=""/9943#v23"">Numbers 15:23</a>] continues -"," The verse states that performance of such an act is a denial of ""all that God commanded you through Moses..."""
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.4,"[Conversely,] anyone who denies the worship of false gods acknowledges the entire Torah in its totality, all the works of the prophets, and everything that has been commanded to the prophets from Adam, [the first man,] until eternity. -"," Just as the acceptance of false gods removes one from the entire sphere of Torah practice, denying their existence gives one a point of connection to the revelation of God's truth."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.1,In [the era of] the Second Temple -, The Chanukah miracle took place in the year 3596 (165 BCE). The Greek persecutions began several years beforehand.
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.1,"issued decrees against the Jewish people, [attempting to] nullify their faith -"," <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 2:4 relates that the Greeks would have the Jews ""write on the horn of an ox that they have no portion in the God of Israel."""
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.1,They extended their hands against their property -," In this era, the Greek rulers established gentile cities in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and deprived the Jewish population of its livelihood."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.1,"they entered the Sanctuary, wrought havoc within -"," See <i>Middot</i> 1:6, 2:3 and <i>Shekalim</i> 6:3, which speak of the Greeks breaking open portions of the <i>Soreg</i>, a divider on the Temple Mount, and destroying portions of the wall around the Temple Courtyard."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.1,"The Jews suffered great difficulties from them, for they oppressed them greatly until the God of our ancestors had mercy upon them, delivered them from their hand, and saved them. -"," By calling attention to the Divine origin of the Jews' victory before mentioning the Hasmoneans, the Rambam emphasizes the miraculous and spiritual nature of the miracle."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.3,"Accordingly, the Sages of that generation -", <i>Shabbat</i> 21b states that the celebration of the holiday was ordained in the year following the miracle.
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.3,as days of happiness -," an acknowledgement of God's miracles in a material context in appreciation of the military victories.</p>
<p>As the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Purim</i>, Chapter 2, ""happiness"" is associated with feasting. In this context, the <i>Yam shel Shlomo, Bava Kama</i> 7:37, explains that according to the Rambam - in contrast to the rulings of the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 670:2) - the festive meals customarily served on Chanukah can be considered to be feasts associated with a mitzvah."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.3,Candles should be lit in the evening at the entrance to the houses on each and every one of these eight nights to publicize and reveal the miracle. -," Both factors, the kindling of the Chanukah candles at night - when their light could be seen - and their placement at the entrance to the house - where their light will be projected into the street - emphasize the principle of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.3,"It is forbidden to eulogize and fast on them, as on the days of Purim. -"," As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 13, the prohibition to eulogize and fast applies only on the days of Chanukah themselves, and not on the preceding or succeeding days.</p>
<p>Significantly, unlike Purim, there is no prohibition against work on Chanukah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 670:1)."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.6,It is not the recitation of Hallel on Chanukah alone that is a Rabbinic ordinance -," Since Chanukah is a Rabbinic holiday, one might think that the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on those days is Rabbinic in origin, while the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on the festivals has its source in the Torah itself. This is not the case."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.6,There are eighteen days during the year when it is a mitzvah to recite the entire Hallel -," in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There are three more days in the diaspora, as mentioned in the following halachah."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.6,"and the holiday of Shavuot. Hallel is not recited on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, since they are days of repentence, awe, and fear, and are not days of extra -"," Rosh HaShanah is a day of happiness. Thus, <a href=""/16515#v10"">Nechemiah 8:10</a>, ""Eat sumptuous foods and drink sweet beverages... for the happiness of God is your strength,"" is interpreted as a reference to Rosh HaShanah. Nevertheless, it is not a day of ""extra celebration."""
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.8,And how should one skip -, when reciting <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh and the latter days of Pesach?
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.8,until the phrase chalamish lema'y'no mayim. -, The conclusion of Psalm 114.
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.8,[continuing] until Halleluyah. -, The conclusion of that psalm.
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.8,[continuing] until Halleluyah. -, The conclusion of that psalm.
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.8,[continuing] until the conclusion of the Hallel. -," i.e., the conclusion of that psalm."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.9,It is appropriate to recite Hallel throughout the entire day. -," Although <i>Hallel</i> is recited directly after the morning service, it is not an integral part of the prayer service and may be recited at other times. See <i>Megillah</i> 20b, which derives an allusion to this concept from the exegesis of <a href=""/16339#v24"">Psalms 118:24</a>: ""This is the day which God wrought; let us rejoice and exult in it."" Our ""rejoicing and exultation,"" the recitation of <i>Hallel</i>, may be carried out throughout the entire day."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.9,"If a person reads and pauses, reads and pauses, even if he pauses for a time long enough to complete the entire [Hallel], he fulfills his obligation. -"," From <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 34b, we can conclude that the laws that apply to the reading of the Megillah also apply to the reading of <i>Hallel</i>. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.)</p>
<p>As mentioned in the commentary on that halachah, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 65:1) rules that should a person be forced to refrain from completing the <i>Shema</i> because the place in which he is located contains filth, he does not fulfill his obligation if he waited the amount of time required to recite the <i>Shema</i> in its entirety. The commentaries question if this law applies with regard to the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> as well. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 422:25.)"
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.9,one may make an interruption between chapters. -," Seemingly, the Rambam does not consider the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> analogous to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> (see <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:15-16) and appears to allow all interruptions (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, however, is more restrictive and allows interruptions only when there is a need.</p>
<p>In their analysis of <i>Berachot</i> 14a (the source for this halachah), Rabbenu Asher and other commentaries differ and compare the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. Thus, one may greet an honored person between the chapters and may respond to a greeting from anyone at that time. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 488:1) follows this ruling."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.9,On the days when Hallel is read while skipping portions -," The <i>Eliyahu Rabba</i> explains that the Rambam's ruling depends on his previous decision that a blessing should not be recited on these days. Making an interruption is significant when a blessing is recited. When a blessing is not recited, what does it matter whether one makes an interruption or not?</p>
<p>Although this explanation may be acceptable according to the Rambam's view, according to the <i>Shulchan Aruch's</i> ruling mentioned below, a different rationale must be applied. (See <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 422.)"
Torah Study 6.1,It is a mitzvah to respect -, and stand up in deference to him as implied by the verse quoted
Torah Study 6.1,even if he is not one's teacher -," in which case more severe measures of honor are necessary, as mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:1) states that this obligation applies only to another sage who surpasses oneself in knowledge."
Torah Study 6.1,"meaning] ""one who has acquired wisdom"" -"," even if he is young.</p>
<p>The definition of a Torah sage is a matter of question. <i>Kiddushin</i> 49b states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">""On the condition that I am a student"" - we do not say that he must be comparable to Shimon ben Azzai or Shimon ben Zoma. Rather, anyone who can be asked about any matter in the area where he is studying and can reply...<br/>
""On the condition that I am a wise man"" - we do not say that he has to be like the Sages of Yavneh....Rather, anyone who can be asked about any Torah subject and can reply...</p>
<p>The Rambam quotes this statement in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>. Nevertheless, since he does not specify such a definition here, in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, one may therefore assume that in this context, he does not limit himself to that definition. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:2) addresses himself to this issue and explains that here we are referring to a Torah sage who possesses a prodigious amount of knowledge and is considered unique within his community."
Torah Study 6.2,One should not stand before [a sage] in a bathhouse -," i.e., in the inner rooms where people stand undressed. The general principle followed is: in the places where it is permitted to recite words of Torah, one must honor a sage; where one may not recite words of Torah, one should not honor a sage (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Torah Study 6.2,"What is the source [which teaches that] a person should not divert his eyes from the sage so that he will not see him, lest he be required to stand before him? -"," <i>Kiddushin</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) states that we would not suspect that a person would fail to honor a sage when the latter is actually in proximity to him. Rather, this implies that it is forbidden for one to turn away when he sees the sage approaching from afar, so that when the latter approaches, he will not be obligated to stand."
Torah Study 6.3,It is not proper for a sage to trouble the people and position himself before them so that they will have to stand for him. -, <i>Kiddushin</i> 33b derives this concept through the exegesis of the verse from Leviticus quoted above.
Torah Study 6.4,Riding is considered to be walking. -," i.e., we do not say that since the sage is seated on his beast, it is not considered as if he is walking. However, in other contexts - see <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:2-3 - the Rambam considers riding as comparable to sitting."
Torah Study 6.5,"the master should walk in the center, the [student of] greater [stature] -", should follow slightly behind him...
Torah Study 6.5,and the one of lesser [stature] -, should follow the sage...
Torah Study 6.6,"One who sees a sage need not stand in deference to him until he reaches within four cubits of him; once he has passed, he may sit. -"," This halachah in its entirety is quoted from the <i>Midrash Hagadol, Shemot</i> 33:8. (With slight textual differences, it also appears in <i>Kiddushin</i> 33b.) Nevertheless, the question arises: Why does the Rambam mention this particular clause? It appears redundant in light of Halachah 1. Perhaps his intent was to emphasize the contrast between an ordinary Sage and others of greater stature."
Torah Study 6.6,one should stand in deference to him from the time he sees him -, the <i>av beit din</i>
Torah Study 6.6,He may not sit until he has passed four cubits beyond him. -," at which point, he may sit."
Torah Study 6.6,one should stand in deference to him from the time he sees him - as far away as he can see. -, as explained with regard to the <i>av beit din</i>.
Torah Study 6.6,When the nasi enters -, the house of study
Torah Study 6.6,They may not sit until he tells them to. -, for he is the spiritual leader of the entire nation and deserves such honor.
Torah Study 6.6,two rows are opened for him -," At present, when we are used to auditoriums with fixed seats, the setting for this law is difficult to picture. However, in Talmudic times, the people would sit on the floor. When the <i>av beit din</i> arrived, the people sitting between the entrance and his place would stand and create a path for him two rows wide."
Torah Study 6.7,When a sage -, of lesser stature than those mentioned in the previous halachah...
Torah Study 6.7,when he approaches within four cubits -," <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> notes that this figure is not found in <i>Horayot</i> 13b, the source for this law. Rather, it was added by the Rambam, based on the logic that no less respect should be paid to a sage when he enters the house of study than is paid to him in the marketplace."
Torah Study 6.7,the latter should stand for him -, and allow him to pass.
Torah Study 6.7,stands -, to allow the sage to pass
Torah Study 6.7,until he -, the Sage
Torah Study 6.7,The sons and the students of the sages may jump over the heads of the people to reach their place when their presence is required by the people at large. -," i.e., there are many students whose presence is an invaluable asset to their teacher, for through their questions they enable their teacher to penetrate to the core of the subject matter. Therefore, they are allowed to proceed to their places at the front of the house of study, even if doing so is somewhat discourteous to the people who have already taken places.</p>
<p>In this vein, <i>Yevamot</i> 105b states: Those who are required by the holy nation may step over the heads of the holy nation. However, how dare one who is not required by the holy nation step over the heads of the holy nation!"
Torah Study 6.7,to enter [the house of study] last. -," doing so is considered an act of laziness, which causes unnecessary difficulty to the people sitting there."
Torah Study 6.7,he may return to his place. -," Forcing the people to stand for him a second time, or the sage's stepping over them is not considered to be discourteous, since he was compelled to leave by forces beyond his control. However, if he leaves for other reasons, he should try not to return to his original place."
Torah Study 6.8,is permitted -," <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) notes that the expression <i>eino rashei</i> can be rendered ""is not obligated,"" and suggests that meaning in this context. However, since rising more frequently can be construed to be an affront to God, it is questionable whether that interpretation can be accepted."
Torah Study 6.9,We should stand before an old man of exceedingly advanced age -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:1) explains this as referring to a man of seventy. Others, emphasizing that the Rambam uses the term ""exceedingly advanced age,"" see that as a reference to <i>Gittin</i> 28a, which describes a person ninety years old with such terminology."
Torah Study 6.9,"Even a sage who is young is obligated to stand before an old man of exceedingly advanced age. Nevertheless, he -"," i.e., the sage of youthful age"
Torah Study 6.9,Even an old gentile -," <i>Kiddushin</i> 33a relates that Rabbi Yochanan would stand in deference to an aged gentile, explaining: ""How many experiences has he gone through!"""
Torah Study 6.9,and a hand should be extended to support him -, <i>Kiddushin</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) notes that Abbaye would follow this practice.
Torah Study 6.10,Torah sages should not personally take part -," However, the sages must bear their share of the cost of such projects (<i>Hilchot Sh'chenim</i> 6:6).

However, the first of the 24 reasons the Rambam lists for imposing a ban of ostracism that must be observed by every Jew is disgracing a Torah sage. (See <i>Avodat Hamelech</i>.)</p>
<p>Among the resolutions of the difficulty offered is that there is a difference between a ban imposed by a court according to Torah law and a ban issued by a sage individually to protect his own honor."

The place in which a watchman keeps an entrusted article is also considered ""your homes.""</p>
<p>The prohibition against entrusting chametz to a gentile is not explicitly stated in the Talmud. It can be derived from the leniency allowing one to maintain possession of chametz belonging to a gentile mentioned at the conclusion of the Halachah. Some authorities explain that the Rambam derived the concept from the <i>Mechiltah</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.</p>
<p>In his commentary on the Torah (<a href=""/9873#v19"">Exodus 12:19)</a>, the Ramban differs with the concept in its entirety and states that a person does not transgress the prohibition against possessing chametz when it is entrusted to a gentile. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:4) accepts the Rambam's opinion. No later halachic authorities question the matter."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.1,he would only transgress [the commandment] when chametz is [found] in his house --, as that verse states
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.1,The Torah --, includes the verse originally mentioned which
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.1,Perhaps a person will be obligated to remove from his property chametz that belongs to a gentile or that was consecrated? --," for that is also ""seen."" Therefore,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.1,"[we may infer]: You may not see your own [leaven]. However, you may see [leaven] belonging to others --"," for that is not ""for you."" The rules governing this concept are the major subject of this chapter."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.2,"[From the above,] you can learn that chametz belonging to a Jew which was left in his possession, even though it is buried, is located in another city, or is entrusted to a gentile, causes him to violate [the commandments]: ""[chametz] shall not be seen"" and ""[chametz] shall not be found"" --"," for in each of these instances, chametz was present within a Jew's possession on Pesach."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.2,"behold, this is permitted, for [the chametz] is not his --"," the Jew's,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.2,under the authority of the Jewish people --, <i>Pesachim</i> 5b emphasizes that even a gentile who lives in a Jew's home may keep chametz during Pesach.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.2,to remove the chametz from his property on Pesach --," Some manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state: ""We need not force him (i.e., the gentile) to remove his chametz from our property."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.2,lest one come to use it. --," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that in Halachah 3:8, the Rambam considers covering the chametz with a utensil as a sufficient measure to prevent the use of the chametz. Two explanations are offered why, in the present instance, a more stringent measure is required:</p>
<p>a) the amount of chametz the gentile entrusted for safekeeping is probably too large to be covered by utensils;</p>
<p>b) covering the chametz with a utensil is only a temporary measure, intended to be effective only until the end of the day of the festival. Once that day is concluded, the chametz must be destroyed. In contrast, in this instance the chametz will remain in the Jew's possession throughout the entire holiday. Hence, more severe measures must be taken.</p>
<p>The Ramban and the <i>Ba'al HaItur</i> do not accept this requirement and maintain that if a Jew does not accept responsibility for the chametz, he is not obligated to construct a partition. All that is necessary is that the chametz be placed out of the way. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:2) and the later halachic authorities all follow the Rambam's opinion."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.3,A gentile who entrusted his chametz to a Jew: Should the Jew accept the responsibility of --," caring for the chametz as a watchman would, and"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.3,"behold, he is obligated to destroy it --", before the sixth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.3,it is considered as though it were his --," and, hence, must be destroyed. <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 6a maintains that if a Jew designates a specific place within his home for the gentile and tells him to place his chametz there, he is not obligated to destroy it even though he accepted responsibility for it. Rashi does not accept this position. From the Rambam's omission of the matter, we may assume he also follows Rashi's view (<i>Lechem Mishnah</i>).</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:1) quotes the Rambam and hence, requires the acceptance of the more stringent position. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (440:16) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (440:3) mention certain leniencies based on <i>Tosefot's</i> position."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.3,he may keep it in his domain --, without transgressing the prohibitions against possessing chametz
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.4,Should a gentile who forces his way upon people --," a literal translation of the word אנס. Some editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> use the expression אלם instead. However, the intention remains the same, regardless of which term is used."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.4,forcing and compelling him to pay even though he did not accept responsibility --," In the previous halachah, the Rambam requires a Jew to destroy chametz only if he willingly accepts responsibility for it. Nevertheless, in this instance,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.5,A Jew who gives his chametz to a gentile --," before Pesach, transferring it into the latter's domain"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.5,"for a loan and tells him: ""If I do not bring the money between today and such and such a date, you acquire the chametz [retroactively] from the present moment"" --"," This specific statement is required, because although a Jewish lender is considered to have acquired a certain degree of ownership over an article given him as security, this principle does not apply with regard to a gentile (<i>Pesachim</i> 31b, <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.5,in the gentile's possession --," In a responsa (no. 252), the Rambam writes that it is as if the Jew sold the chametz to the gentile outright."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.5,This applies if the date specified was before Pesach --," more specifically, before the sixth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad disagrees with this law and maintains that if this stipulation was included, the chametz is considered as belonging to the gentile even if the date mentioned is after Pesach. The Rambam maintains that since the Jew has the right to redeem his chametz during Pesach, it is still considered his (Rabbenu Ephraim). In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 441:1) accepts the Ra'avad's view.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this leniency applies only when the Jew willingly foregoes any right to the chametz and considers to have repaid his loan with it. Should the Jew decide to redeem his chametz after Pesach, he is retroactively considered the owner and is liable for possessing chametz throughout the holiday."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.5,that chametz is --," not considered as repayment for the loan. Rather, it is"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.6,A Jew and a gentile are traveling together in a ship --," This halachah is a quote from the <i>Tosefta, Pesachim</i> 2:6. Nevertheless, it is worthy of question why the Rambam quotes that source verbatim. Often, when mentioning such a law, the Rambam will eliminate particulars that are extraneous to the principle he wishes to communicate."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.6,"When the fifth hour [on the fourteenth of Nisan] arrives - behold, he should sell it to the gentile --"," Today, in many Jewish communities, the sale of chametz to gentiles is an almost indispensable element in the observance of Pesach. Nevertheless, the details of the sale and the legal provisions which,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) on one hand, ensure that the gentile is the sole legal owner of the chametz on Pesach, and</p>
<p>b) assure the Jewish owner of receiving the goods in return, or their monetary equivalent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are a technical matter which has been discussed by the Rabbis in their responsa over the generations. For this reason, it is not advisable for a person to sell his chametz himself. Rather, he should entrust the local Rabbi with the responsibility of carrying out the sale."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.6,He may return and buy it back from him after Pesach --," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 448:3) states: ""Even though the Jew who sells it to the gentile knows that he will not touch it at all, but will watch it for him until after Pesach and then return it to him, it is permitted."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.7,The Jew may tell the gentile --," This is a continuation of the above <i>Tosefta</i>, ibid. 2:7."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.7,"Rather than buy from a gentile, come and buy from a Jew --"," i.e., from me"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.8,"[A person] who possesses a mixture of chametz transgresses [the prohibitions]: ""[leaven] shall not be seen"" and ""[leaven] shall not be found"" because of it --"," As explained in Halachah 1:6, according to the Rambam a person who eats a mixture of chametz does not transgress the same Torah prohibition as one who eats chametz itself. Hence, he is not liable for the punishment of כרת. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the possession of these mixtures only violates the prohibitions against possessing chametz when they contain a substantial amount of chametz (at least the size of an olive in a quantity to be eaten בכדי אכילת פרס).</p>
<p>Rav Moshe HaCohen maintains that even the possession of a smaller amount violates these prohibitions. Rav Yosef Caro supports this view in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. Although he does not explicitly state so in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442:1) when discussing this law, the later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>) accept this opinion as binding."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.8,"Babylonian kotach, and Median beer --", See Halachah 1:6 for a description of these substances.

<p>Rav Chayim Soloveitchik (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:1) differentiates between the two cases as follows. Chametz itself is a forbidden substance. Hence, it must be spoiled to the point that a dog cannot benefit from it. In contrast, the other substances are merely mixtures of chametz. They are only forbidden because they contain the taste of chametz. Hence, once that taste is no longer suitable for human consumption, there is no reason why they should remain forbidden.</p>
<p>He continues relating that, as stated in Halachot 11 and 12, chametz that is obviously designated for purposes other than food can be used even though it has not become spoiled. Thus, one could explain that once the chametz in the above mixtures becomes unfit for human consumption, it is clearly not food. In contrast, bread which is originally made for that intent must spoil more."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.11,that has become spoiled --," beyond being fit for consumption by a dog. Rabbenu Manoach emphasizes that it must become spoiled before the prohibition against chametz takes effect. Otherwise, it must be destroyed."

<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i> I, 33) states that present circumstances differ from those during the <i>Mishnah Berurah's</i> era, and, at present, priests who violate the Sabbath laws are not judged as severely and may bless the people. Nevertheless, he agrees that if restricting such individuals from reciting the priestly blessings may motivate them to increase their Sabbath observance, they may be prevented from blessing the people."

A young priest should not recite the priestly blessings until he grows a full beard. -," As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 8, Halachah 11, the expression ""grows a full beard"" is a primarily measure of age, whether the person actually grows a beard or not.</p>

If he has manifested signs of physical maturity, he may recite the priestly blessing even while alone. However, he should do so only as a temporary measure, and not as a fixed practice, until he grows a full beard.</p>
<p>Intoxication: - The Hebrew יין literally means wine. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 128:55 notes that the Rambam speaks only about wine and does not mention other alcoholic beverages. Accordingly, he explains that a person who becomes drunk from other alcoholic beverages may recite the priestly blessing, unless he is so drunk that he has no control of himself.</p>
<p>It is significant that in Chapter 4, Halachah 17, when speaking about the prohibition against an intoxicated person praying, the Rambam states: ""A person who is drunk should not pray.... When is a person considered drunk? When he cannot speak before a king."" See also <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 1:1-2, where the Rambam describes the prohibition against serving in the Temple while intoxicated and mentions, albeit with differences between them, both a person who drank wine and one who became intoxicated from other alcoholic beverages.</p>

He maintains that this choice of language was intended to imply that if a priest washed his hands in the morning, he need not wash them a second time unless they have become ritually impure. He also quotes a responsum of Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, who explicitly states that a priest may rely on his morning washing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:6), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the opinion of Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Sotah</i> 39a), who require the priests to have their hands washed a second time as an additional measure of holiness."

Thus, the failure to bless the people is considered as nullifying the observance of three commands.</p>
<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), the Rambam cites this teaching as a classic example of a fundamental principle regarding the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. Though the Talmud often states that many mitzvot are involved in the performance or transgression of a particular commandment, this does not mean that the mitzvah should be counted as more than one mitzvah when calculating the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

The difference between these two laws can be resolved by taking into account the nature of the prohibited substances: Rings are small, and the loss of a single ring does not make a substantial difference to the entire group. In contrast, barrels of wine are large, and the loss of even one will attract attention.</p>
<p>[which fell]. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) limits this leniency, stating that it is forbidden to use a single ring alone, nor may one person benefit from the entire group of rings at once.</p>

Rather, one must knock the chicks down with a stave, and then collect them. The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> (and the <i>Turei Zahav, Yoreh De'ah</i> 142:12) explain that climbing on the tree or using it as support for a ladder would involve deriving benefit from the forbidden tree.</p>
<p>The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Me'ilah</i> 3:9, suggests a different interpretation. There, the Rambam specifically writes that when taking the nest - as stated in the final clause of this halachah - it permissible to climb up the tree in the normal manner. Therefore, it appears that one should knock down the chicks to see if they are capable of flying on their own or not. This explanation also clarifies why the Rambam does not mention in this halachah the need to knock down the chicks. By stating that only those which do not need their mother are permitted, he implies that one must determine whether or not the chicks need their mother (Rav Kapach)."

He responded: ""One does not reply in a bathhouse."" After he had departed, he told him, ""I did not come into her territory, she came into mine.

Other authorities, however, do not share this opinion, and maintain that there is no prohibition against using such a knife. (See Ramah, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 142:2 and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i>, 10:1, which accept the latter view as halachah.)"

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that, based on Halachot 12 and 13, it would appear that the Rambam maintains that all the meat from the animal is forbidden, and there is no way one may benefit from it. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> does not accept that view, and argues that it is sufficient to destroy an amount of meat equivalent to the value of the knife.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is forbidden to cut meat - i.e., cut large pieces of meat into smaller ones"
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 7.19,"Should one cut with a destructive intent, causing a loss -"," e.g., cut pieces which are of a size fit for cooking into smaller ones, which would be less attractive. See <i>Chulin</i> 8b."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.1,When the Sages -," Ezra and his court, the <i>Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah</i>"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.1,they [also] established other blessings to be recited every day. -," In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:4, the Rambam writes:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">There are three types of blessings: blessings associated with [deriving] satisfaction, blessings associated with mitzvot, and blessings of thanksgiving which are a process of praise, thanksgiving, and request so that we will continually remember the Creator and fear Him.</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 10:1, the Rambam writes that the blessings associated with the prayer service are included in the category of blessings of thanksgiving. This position is not accepted by all authorities. For example, the <i>Avudraham</i> considers the blessings associated with the prayer service as a separate category of blessings."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.1,to sleep at night -, The Rambam begins his discussion of the blessings of prayer with one recited at night in keeping with the concept that the new day starts after sunset. (See also <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:1 and our commentary there.)
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.1,the bonds of sleep -," Our translation is based on <a href=""/16474#v6"">Esther 1:6</a> which mentions חבלי בוץ - ""bonds (or cords) of linen"" (<i>Otzar HaTefilot</i>). The phrase may also be rendered as ""the pains of sleep"" based on <a href=""/16167#v13"">Hoshea 13:13</a> חבלי יולדה - ""the pains of childbirth."" Exhaustion is painful to one's eyes and makes it difficult to keep them open."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.1,and illuminates the pupil of the eye -," See the <i>Targum</i> to <a href=""/16238#v8"">Psalms 17:8</a>. In Nusach Ashkenaz, this clause appears later in the blessing."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.1,to save me from the evil inclination and from a bad occurrence. May I not be disturbed by bad dreams or evil thoughts. -, The prevention of sinful thoughts and the avoidance of nocturnal emissions during sleep are two of the main reasons given for reciting the <i>Shema</i> before retiring.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.1,and may You raise me up from it to life and peace and illuminate my eyes lest I sleep a sleep of death -," This is based on <a href=""/16234#v4"">Psalms 13:4</a>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.2,"[Then,] -"," <i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one first recites <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and then, the blessing of <i>hamapil</i> (the blessing discussed in Halachah 1). This opinion is quoted by the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 239:1). However, this order is only followed in Nusach Ari. Both Nusach Ashkenaz and Nusach Sephard follow the order stated by the Rambam.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1) relates that Rav Zeira was accustomed to recite the <i>Shema</i> over and over until he fell asleep. This indicates that the <i>Shema</i> is the last thing said at night before sleeping (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> in the name of Rabbenu Nissim Gaon)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.2,of Kri'at Shema and goes to sleep -," <i>Berachot</i> 4b explains that ""it is a mitzvah"" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring. These statements are based on <a href=""/16225#v5"">Psalms 4:5</a>: ""Tremble, but do not sin. Speak in your heart upon your bed and be still."" Our Sages interpreted ""Speak in your heart"" and ""upon your bed"" as allusions to the phrases ""with all your heart"" and ""upon your bed"" in the<i>Shema</i>.</p>
<p>That Talmudic passage implies that the reason for reciting the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is to protect oneself from undesirable influences during the night. According to Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) and others who allow the evening service to be recited before sunset, the recitation of <i>Shema</i> before retiring enables us to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. According to the writings of the Ari, the reciting of the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is a service of spiritual preparation for the soul's ascent from the body during sleep.</p>
<p>Since <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that ""it is a mitzvah"" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring, it was customary in certain communities to recite a blessing before reciting the <i>Shema</i> as is customary before performing other mitzvot. In his responsa (<i>Pe'air HaDor</i> 100), the Rambam specifically rules against reciting such a blessing. [However, note the <i>Kolbo</i> (29) who quotes the Rambam as stating in a responsa that such a blessing is required.]"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.2,"If he is overcome by sleep, -"," and cannot recite the entire first section, at the very least"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.3,"When a person awakes after concluding his sleep, -"," I.e., in the morning when he has completed his night's sleep.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> points out that although <i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one recites this blessing upon arising, the Rambam specifies that it be said only after concluding one's sleep. This makes it clear that a person who wakes up in the middle of the night and intends to return to sleep, need not recite this blessing."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.3,he says: My Lord -," In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:1, the Rambam writes:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">All of the blessings begin with <i>Baruch</i> and conclude with <i>Baruch</i> except the final blessing of the blessings associated with the <i>Shema</i>, a blessing which follows directly after another blessing, and a blessing over fruit, those [blessings] which resemble it, or a blessing for mitzvot.</p>
<p>Given this statement, the commentaries wonder why this blessing does not begin with <i>Baruch</i>. Furthermore, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:5, the Rambam writes that, unless a blessing follows another blessing, it must mention God's sovereignty over the world and no such mention is made in this blessing.</p>
<p>The <i>Meiri</i> in his commentary to <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) offers the following resolution to these difficulties: Despite the fact that the entire period of a person's sleep divides between the recitation of <i>hamapil</i> and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i>, the sleep is not considered as an interruption and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is considered as following directly after <i>hamapil</i>. Accordingly, it is not required to begin with <i>Baruch</i> or mention God's sovereignty.</p>
<p>Other commentaries who follow different halachic perspectives than the Rambam offer these resolutions:<br/>
1) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is a blessing of praise and prayer and does not require an opening phrase of blessing, in the same way that the blessing recited before travelling does not (<i>Tosafot, Pesachim</i> 104b).<br/>
2) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is generally recited immediately after the blessing of אשר יצר and therefore can be considered as a blessing which follows another blessing."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.3,is pure. -," Despite his lowly physical state, man possesses an innate spirituality, a pure Godly soul, which is the source of all his positive actions and thoughts."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.3,and You preserve it within me. -," Although the natural inclination of the soul is to return to its Source, God preserves its presence within the body in order that the person may serve His Creator in this world (<i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 62)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.3,and restore it to me in the Time to Come -, at the time of the resurrection of the dead.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.3,"within me, I am thankful before You, O God, my Lord, Master of all works. -"," Some siddurim add the phrase, ""Lord of all souls,"" at this point so that the concluding phrase of the body of the blessing will correspond to the wording of the blessing itself."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4,"When one hears the crow of a rooster, he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who gives the rooster understanding to distinguish between day and night. -"," Since the crowing of the rooster generally heralds the dawn, the Sages established this blessing in response to it.</p>
<p>The word שכוי is translated as ""rooster"" based on <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26a which refers to <a href=""/16440#v36"">Job 38:36</a>: ""Who has put wisdom in the inward parts and [given] understanding to the rooster (שכוי).""</p>
<p>Rabbenu Asher (in his halachic commentary to <i>Berachot</i>) interprets שכוי as ""heart."" The heart is the source of understanding which allows man to distinguish between day and night."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4,"he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who clothes the naked. -"," Understood simply, this blessing expresses our appreciation to God for the clothes we wear.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4,"he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who crowns Israel in glory. -"," The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) associates this blessing with the prohibition of walking four cubits with one's head uncovered (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b; See <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 5:6).

This is their glory, as <a href=""/15993#v3"">Isaiah 62:3</a> states: ""You shall be a crown of glory in the hand of God."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4,he recites: [Blessed...] who opens the eyes of the blind. -," This blessing is based on <a href=""/16367#v18"">Psalms 146:18</a> and can be interpreted as a statement of gratitude for more than our physical eyesight.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4,"When he washes his hands, -"," In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:2, the Rambam specifically states that one should recite this blessing before washing one's hands so that the blessing will precede the performance of the mitzvah (<i>Pesachim</i> 7a). Rabbenu Yonah states that one should not recite this blessing until after washing one's hands because until one has washed his hands, he is not in a fit state to mention God's name (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 4:2). (According to others, the recitation of this blessing should be delayed until after drying one's hands.)</p>
<p>The Rambam obviously does not accept this rationale since he requires many blessings to be recited before the washing of the hands as above."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4,regarding the washing of hands. -," This washing is required in preparation for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> and the morning service.</p>
<p>Based on the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. I, 169b, 184b), the Rabbis rule that, on washing in the morning, one pours water over his hands three times alternately, i.e., once over the right hand, once over the left hand, once more over the right, etc. This is done in order to remove the spirit of impurity that remains after sleep."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4,he recites: -," There are slight, but significant, differences between the text of the blessing here and its source in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4,"and slumber from my eyelids. May it be Your will, God, -"," This entire prayer is considered one blessing. Therefore, one should not recite ""Amen"" after hearing a colleague recite the opening sentence of the blessing (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 46:1). <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) states that one should say ""and may it be..."" to emphasize that the prayer is a single blessing."

<p>Rav Shlomo Kluger cites our Sages' statement, ""A person should sell everything he owns and buy shoes,"" as evidence that a person who has shoes to wear has acquired that which is most necessary.</p>
<p>The <i>Sh'loh</i> quotes the Maharshal as explaining the source for this blessing as <a href=""/16229#v6"">Psalms 8:6</a>-9.</p>

<p>Wearing leather shoes demonstrates the way in which the animal kingdom has been placed ""under man's feet"" and makes us aware that the dominion we have been granted over all creation allows us to acquire ""all our needs."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.6,[Blessed... universe] who prepares the steps of man -," This blessing is based on <a href=""/16258#v23"">Psalms 37:23</a>: ""The steps of man are ordered by God"" and <a href=""/16391#v24"">Proverbs 20:24</a>: ""The steps of man are from God,"" both of which imply that in addition to giving man the ability to walk, God also guides the direction of his steps."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.6,"Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a non-Jew -"," We thank God for creating us with the opportunity to relate to Him through the Torah and mitzvot which were given only to the Jews.</p>
<p><i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) uses a positive statement for the formula of this blessing: ""Blessed... who has made me a Jew."" Rabbenu Asher quotes this text. The Rambam's version is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 9:2. Rabbenu Yitzchok Alfasi also follows the Jerusalem Talmud.</p>
<p>The <i>Levush, Orach Chayim</i> 46, explains the reason for reciting the blessing in the negative: <i>Eruvin</i> 13a states that it would have been better for man not to have been created than to have been created (i.e., man's soul was in a higher state before its descent into the world than it is while in this world). Therefore, we do not express thanks for being created. Nevertheless, having been created, we thank God for not creating us as gentiles since gentiles have a far lesser number of commandments to fulfill.</p>
<p>The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> explains that the negative formula was chosen for the following reason. Our Sages required that we recite three blessings each morning. Torah law states that whenever a single blessing covers two different circumstances, the second blessing may not be recited. Therefore, since a statement thanking God ""for making me a Jew"" would make the blessing for ""not making me a servant"" superfluous, it is preferable to recite this blessing using the negative formula."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.7,These eighteen blessings -," Only seventeen blessings are recited in the morning. The eighteenth blessing is <i>hamapil</i>, the blessing recited before retiring at night. Nevertheless, as explained in the commentary to Halachah 3, the Rambam views it as connected to the morning blessings.</p>
<p>The eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and also to the number of times God's name is mentioned in Psalms 29, in the song sung by the Jewish People after the splitting of the Red Sea (<a href=""/9876#v1"">Exodus 15:1</a>-19), and in the three sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. (See also our commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.7,"Rather, one recites each of them in response to the condition for which the blessing was instituted, at the appropriate time. -"," The Rambam's statements in this and the following two halachot are all based on the idea that these blessings are ברכות הודאה - ""blessings of thanks."" Therefore, a person who does not receive the benefit associated with a particular blessing does not recite the blessing thanking God for that particular condition.</p>
<p>Rav Natrunai Gaon and Rav Amram Gaon differ with the Rambam. They consider these blessings to be ברכות שבח - ""blessings of praise"" for the goodness which God has granted the world as a whole and not thanks for benefit which one has derived as an individual. This opinion is accepted by the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) and other Ashkenazic halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Sephardic authorities accept the Rambam's view with certain reservations."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.7,"One who fastens his belt while still in his bed recites [the blessing] ""who girds Israel with strength"" -"," Although in Halachah 6, the Rambam stated that this blessing should be recited after one has gotten off his bed, if one fastens his belt while still in bed, he recites the appropriate blessing at that time."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.7,Any blessing in which one is not obligated -, because one has not personally derived the benefit associated with the mitzvah
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.8,What is implied? -," This halachah exemplifies the final principle mentioned in the previous halachah, that a person should not recite a blessing if he does not derive the benefit associated with it."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.8,"should not recite the blessing ""who clothes the naked"" upon rising. -"," Since, though he is clothed, he performed the activity associated with the blessing on the previous day."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.8,"one does not recite the blessing al netilat yadayim, -"," In Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor 3:2, the Rambam qualifies the prohibition against washing by stating: ""One [who is] soiled from excrement or dirt may wash the dirty area in the normal fashion without worry."" He also allows a woman to wash her hands in order to feed her child.</p>
<p>The source for the Rambam's statements, <i>Yoma</i> 77b, explains that the reason for this leniency is the presence of <i>shivta</i> on her hands. Rashi interprets this as רוח רעה, the spirit of impurity which rests on our hands before the morning washing.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Yoma</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) rules that one does wash his hands upon rising in the morning on Yom Kippur since רוח רעה is considered like any filth and may be removed in its normal fashion. As apparent from the previous halachot, the Rambam does not consider רוח רעה as a significant factor and forbids such washing. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh, Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i>.)</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 613:2) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion and states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">One washes his hands in the morning [on Yom Kippur] and recites על נטילת ידים. One should be careful to wash only the ends of the joints of his fingers.</p>
<p>The Ramah adds: ""And he should not intend to enjoy the washing, and do so [only] to remove the רוח רעה from his hands."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.8,"does not recite the blessing, ""who created man in wisdom...."" -", as part of the morning blessings.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10,"One who rises to study Torah, whether the Written or Oral Law, -"," There is debate in the Talmud about this matter. Some Sages did not require the recitation of a blessing for the study of certain portions of the Oral Law (See <i>Berachot</i> 11b). Nevertheless, the decision quoted by the Rambam is accepted by all halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:2 explains the reason for this decision, ""They [all portions of the Oral Law] are all Torah and were given to Moses at Mount Sinai."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10,"recite [the following] three blessings, and then study. -"," Both here and in Halachah 11, the Rambam states that one must study immediately after reciting these blessings. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) explains the motivating principle: All blessings recited before the performance of a commandment must be followed immediately by the fulfillment of the commandment.</p>
<p>This position is, however, not universally accepted. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b), Rabbenu Yonah, and the Mordechai disagree and do not require the repetition of the blessings even if an interruption was made between their recitation and Torah study. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>,:9) warns against making such an interruption.</p>
<p>[The comparison of the blessings before Torah study to the blessings of the mitzvot is not universally accepted. In addition to the opinion of the Ramban mentioned in the following halachah, the <i>Levush</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) compares the blessings before Torah study to the blessings recited before partaking of food. Just as one thanks God for the satisfaction granted from food and other physical things, one blesses Him for the satisfaction derived from Torah study. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:1, <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> Vol. 14.]"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10,And -," The presence here of the Hebrew letter <i>vav</i> (ו) which is generally translated as ""and"" is the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) explains that, according to <i>Rabbenu Tam</i>, any blessing that follows another blessing of only a single line must itself begin ""Blessed are You..."" and cannot be included in the phrase ""Blessed are You..."" in the first blessing. Therefore, since this paragraph does not begin ""Blessed are You...,"" it appears to be a continuation of the first blessing and not a blessing of its own. The <i>vav</i> - ""and"" - indicates the connection between the two paragraphs.</p>
<p>The Rambam, however, clearly states that the second paragraph is considered as a blessing in its own right and not a continuation of the first blessing. The <i>vav</i> would, therefore, appear to be superfluous. Though most printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include a <i>vav</i>, the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Yemenite manuscripts, and the Ramah's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> all lack a <i>vav</i>. (Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:5, which explains that even according to the opinion that the second paragraph is a separate blessing, adding the <i>vav</i> is in place.)</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 47:6 rules that the <i>vav</i> should be recited. The Ramah adds that although the custom is not to say it, it should be said. Most siddurim of <i>Nusach Ashkenaz</i> and <i>Sefard</i> include the <i>vav</i>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10,"in our mouths and in the mouths of Your people, the entire House of Israel. May we, our offspring, -"," The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> adds ""and our offsprings' offspring"" as a reference to the statement (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a) that the Torah will never depart from a family which has three generations of Torah scholars. However, this version is not included in many siddurim."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10,"Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has chosen us from among all the nations and given us His Torah. -"," The designation of Israel as God's chosen people is associated with His giving them the Torah on Mount Sinai (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 47)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.11,One is obligated to recite these three blessings -," The nature of this obligation is debated among the commentaries. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) and others understand the Rambam as considering these blessings similar to any other blessing recited before the performance of a mitzvah and hence, of Rabbinic origin.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <i>Berachot</i> 21a and <i>Yoma</i> 37a state that the obligation to recite a blessing on Torah study stems from the Torah itself. In keeping with this view, the Ramban (<i>Hosafot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, positive commandment 15) reckons the recitation of the blessings of the Torah as a separate mitzvah."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.11,"Afterwards, one should read a few words of Torah. -"," If these blessings are comparable to other blessings recited before the performance of mitzvot, the mitzvah (studying Torah) must also be fulfilled immediately after the recitation of the blessing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.11,"In certain places, they recite [the passage (<a href=""/9956#v1"">Numbers 28:1</a>-9)]: ""Command the children of Israel...,"" -", These verses describe the morning sacrifice offered daily in the Holy Temple. The <i>Machzor Vitri</i> (an early siddur of French origin) does not include the Priestly Blessing and mentions these verses instead.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.12,The Sages praised -," Rav Kapach notes that at the beginning of this chapter, the Rambam attributes the order of the prayers to the <i>Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah</i>. Therefore, we can assume that they also instituted the practice of reciting verses of praise before the blessings of the <i>Shema</i>. (Note the statement of Rabbi Simlai, <i>Berachot</i> 32a, which suggests praising God before reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.) Though from the passage from <i>Shabbat</i> quoted below one might infer that the recitation of these verses was instituted later, perhaps this refers to the designation of the specific verses to be recited, while the practice of reciting verses itself had already existed."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.12,until the end of the Book [of Psalms] -," <i>Shabbat</i> 118b relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Rabbi Yossi said: ""May my portion be with those who complete [the recitation of] <i>Hallel</i> every day.""<br/>
That cannot be. Behold, the master taught that one who recites <i>Hallel</i> every day is considered as a blasphemer and abuser.<br/>
In regard to what did [Rabbi Yossi] make his statement? In regard to פסוקי דזמרא - the verses of song.</p>
<p>The Rambam understands פסוקי דזמרא as referring to the last six chapters of Psalms (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). This definition is also accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.12,"and a blessing after [concluding] them, Yishtabach. -"," The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> explain that the blessings, <i>Baruch She'amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> are considered a single unit. Therefore, <i>Yishtabach</i> is considered a blessing which follows directly after another blessing - despite the verses recited between the two blessings. Accordingly, it does not begin ""Blessed are You, God....""</p>
<p>Though the verses of פסוקי דזמרא are not considered an interruption between the blessings, idle conversation certainly would be. Thus, the Jerusalem Talmud rules that anyone who talks between <i>Baruch She'amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> has transgressed and is not fit to be part of the Jewish army (which must be composed only of righteous men)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.13,"There are places where they are accustomed to recite the Song of the Sea (<a href=""/9875#v30"">Exodus 14:30</a>-15:26) each day -"," The <i>Zohar</i> (II:54b) states that anyone who recites this song at present will merit to recite it in the Messianic age.</p>
<p>See also the <i>Tosefta, Berachot</i> (2:1) and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 66:4 which emphasize (albeit in a different context) that the obligation to recall the exodus from Egypt each day should also include the recollection of the miracle of the splitting of the sea."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.13,"Afterwards, they recite the blessings for the Shema -"," It is improper to make an interruption between <i>Yishtabach</i> and the blessings of the <i>Shema</i>. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 54:3) However, verses of praise and prayer are not considered an interruption. Note the custom of reciting <i>Shir hama'alot</i> at this point in prayer during the Ten Days of Repentance.</p>
<p>Today, we recite the Song of the Sea before <i>Yishtabach</i>. <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> suggests that this is because it is also praise of God and thus, is appropriate within the context of פסוקי דזמרא."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.14,A person is obligated to recite 100 blessings [in the period of one] day and night -," <i>Menachot</i> 43b relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Rabbi Meir used to say: ""One is obligated to recite 100 blessings every day as [implied by <a href=""/9974#v12"">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>]: 'And now Israel, what is it that God, your Lord, asks of you.'”</p>
<p>Rashi explains that the word, מה- ""what"" can be read as מאה - ""100"", allowing for the interpretation, ""And now Israel, 100 [blessings] is what God, your Lord, asks of you.""</p>
<p>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) quotes Rav Natrunai Gaon who attributes the institution of this custom to King David."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.14,the seven blessings before and after Kri'at Shema in the morning and in the evening -, Two blessings before the <i>Shema</i> and one blessing afterwards in the morning; two blessings before the <i>Shema</i> and two afterwards in the evening. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:5.)
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.14,"When he puts on his <i>tefillin</i>, he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to put on <i>tefillin</i> -"," Note <i>Hilchot Tefilin</i> 4:5, where the Rambam states that only one blessing should be recited when putting on <i>tefillin</i>. Other authorities require two blessings to be recited: one, on the Tefilah placed on the arm, and another, on the Tefilah placed on the head. See also the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 25:9 and the Ramah's notes there."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.14,"Behold, this is 86 blessings -"," i.e., the 23 of the morning blessings, the 7 associated with the <i>Shema</i>, 1 on <i>tefillin</i>, 1 on <i>tzitzit</i>, and 54 (18x3) from the three <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> prayers."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.17,from the first blessing before [the Shema] -," Precisely which portion of the blessing to omit is a matter of debate among the Rabbis. See <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 59."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.17,does not recite Kedushah. -," As stated in Chapter 8, Halachot 4-6, any ""holy matter"" should not be recited in the absence of a <i>minyan</i> of ten people. The <i>Kedushah</i> recited when repeating the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is considered as a ""holy matter"" of this nature. (See <i>Berachot</i> 21b, <i>Megillah</i> 23b. See also Chapter 8, Halachah 4, and Chapter 9, Halachah 5 for a discussion of the text of <i>Kedushah</i>.)</p>
<p>In this halachah, the Rambam equates all three recitations of the <i>Kedushah</i> in the morning service. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 59) cites Rav Natrunai Gaon as also sharing this opinion. There is no specific Talmudic or Midrashic source to this effect. However, the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, 129b, 132b) also considers all three recitations of <i>Kedushah</i> to be bound by the same rulings.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Yonah quotes the opinion of the Ashkenazic authorities who distinguish between these recitations of <i>Kedushah</i>. They maintain that since, in the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, we liken ourselves to the angels and recite the same praises, a <i>minyan</i> is necessary. However, the other <i>Kedushot</i> are simply narrative descriptions of the praises uttered by the angels and therefore, do not require a <i>minyan</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 59:3) quotes the Rambam's position. The Ramah concludes that even an individual should recite the blessing without deleting the <i>Kedushah</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> writes that Rabbi Avraham, the Rambam's son, states that his father later changed his position regarding this halachah and wrote in a responsum that one should recite <i>Kedushah</i> even without a quorum of ten. This is also recorded by <i>Orchot Chayim</i>, Rashba, and Rabbenu Manoach. However, there are other responsa which indicate that the Rambam did not change his mind."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.2,With regard to these five species of grain: If [flour from these species] is kneaded with fruit juice alone — מי פירות," literally means ""the water of fruit."" However, as the halachah explains, the practical application of the term is much broader."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.2,"The following are [included in the category] of fruit juice: wine, milk, honey --", The <i>Hagahot Maimoni</i> explains that this applies to both bee and date honey.

(See Halachah 12.) Less time is required when heat is applied to it. Hence, cooking or baking with wheat or flour on Pesach must be carried out under careful guidelines."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.3,"or flour [in water], for example, dough balls --"," A dish resembling <i>kneidlach</i>, but made with regular flour rather than matzah meal."

Similarly, it can be ground into meal, and then used as flour without the fear of becoming chametz. (See also <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 463:3.)</p>
<p>This law is the basis of the widely practiced leniency of cooking and baking with matzah meal. Nevertheless, certain Ashkenazic communities refrain from using matzah meal because of the custom of שרויה<i>, gebruks</i>. Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi (Responsum VI; see also <i>Sha'arei Teshuvah, Orach Chayim</i> 460:10) writes that it is possible that some of the dough was not baked thoroughly and some flour remaining in it could become chametz when cooked again."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.5,and then ground [into flour]: That flour should not be cooked with water lest it has not been roasted well in the fire and thus will become leavened when cooked --," Rabbenu Manoach explains that this law applies only to light roasting. If grain is roasted thoroughly, its flour may be used. However, in instances of this nature, the Rabbis would rather forbid such practices entirely than allow a loosely defined leniency.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.7,"Spain, and the cities of the western [diaspora] have accepted the custom of not stirring wheat in water --"," Rabbenu Manoach mentions that this custom was several hundred years old in his time (approx. 1200 CE). <i>Pesachim</i> 40a mentions that even in Talmudic times, a בעל נפש (a person precise in the observance of the commandments) would not use wheat that had been stirred. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 453:5) states that stirring wheat is ""prohibited."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.8,A dish that was cooked and barley or wheat --," Some authorities recommend more severe laws for wheat than for barley, but the Rambam equates the two."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.8,If the grains have cracked open --," they have surely become chametz. Hence,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.8,If they have not cracked open --," Halachah 6 above mentions a more severe measure. However, that ruling concerns the kernels of grain themselves, while our law deals with their effect on another dish, which is merely a Rabbinic ordinance.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.9,"Therefore, our Sages declared: A person must be careful regarding the grain which he eats on Pesach --"," <i>Pesachim</i> 40a relates that Ravvah would tell the harvesters cutting wheat for Pesach: ""Have the intent that this grain be used for the mitzvah of matzah."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.9,after it has been harvested --," Based on the above passage from <i>Pesachim</i>, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi and the Rambam require that the grain be watched from the time of harvesting onward. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Asher follows a more lenient policy and does not require the wheat to be watched until it is ground. [Rabbenu Nissim explains that even Rav Yitzchak Alfasi only recommended watching the matzah from harvesting as a pious measure, and not as an absolute rule.]</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 453:4) explains that it is preferable to use grain that has been watched from harvesting; as a minimum requirement, one must use grain that has been watched from the time it has been ground into flour. If there is no other alternative, one may buy flour in the marketplace and begin watching from the time the dough is kneaded.</p>
<p>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> clarifies the latter point explaining that where grain is washed or submerged in water before grinding it into flour, such grain may not be used for matzah. (This practice is still common in many communities.) In practice, most <i>shemurah matzah</i> made at present is watched from the time the grain was harvested."

Since the wheat was constantly being agitated, it would not become leavened. In contrast, this halachah contains a more stringent ruling, for the grain was left at rest (<i>Tzafnat Paneach</i>)."

However, a large dough is hard to manage. Hence, our Sages restricted a dough's size to insure that women kneading it will be able to continually agitate the entire dough.</p>
<p>The <i>Rokeach</i> mentioned that in his age, baking conditions had changed from Talmudic times. More people were involved in the process and the ovens were larger and baked matzot more quickly. Therefore, leniency was taken as regards the restriction of the size of the dough. However, the Shulchan Aruch HaRav and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> both recommend adhering to the former practice."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.16,"behold, it should be poured out in a place which slopes downward, so it will not collect in one place --"," See <i>Pesachim</i> 42a. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 459:4) also gives instructions about cleaning the utensils used in preparing the matzah to ensure that no dough is allowed to remain stuck to them, and thus become chametz."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.17,We should not soak bran --," The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 454:2 notes that there is a difference of opinion among halachic authorities if מורסן refers to the hard shell of the wheat kernels that falls off when the wheat is ground, or the soft shell, which is separated by sifting."

<p>Perhaps this lack of a clear source is the reason the Rambam's opinion is not accepted by other halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 465:1) forbids placing bran in water under any circumstances. The Ramah cautions against placing any grain products in a place where there is a residue of moisture."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.18,"immediately, or if one places [the feed] before them and stands over them, to ensure that the food will not stand --"," without any activity, as the Rambam continues"

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.19,A person should not chew wheat --, for the spittle can cause the wheat to become leavened.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.19,for it will become chametz. --," Rabbenu Manoach notes that the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Yesodai HaTorah</i> 5:8) that, when there is danger to life or limb, it is permissible to use all substances as remedies, even if it is forbidden to benefit from them. That halachah specifically states that a sick person may be given chametz to eat as a remedy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that halachah explains that if the sick person does not benefit from the forbidden substance in the normal manner, it may be used as a remedy even if there is no danger to life or limb. The Rambam gives the example of including chametz in a compress.</p>
<p>On that basis, Rabbenu Manoach questions why wheat cannot be used as a poultice as stated in our halachah. However, he resolves the issue by explaining that, in our case, the wheat would become chametz before it was applied to the wound.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 466:5 (and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>) emphasize that it is permitted to use grain as a remedy for a wound only if there is a question of danger to life or limb. Furthermore, this leniency is qualified as follows:</p>
<p>a) it must be an established medical fact that the remedy works;</p>
<p>b) effort must be made to reduce the chance of the grain becoming leavened to the greatest extent possible (e.g., preparing grain by boiling it in fruit juice which does not become leavened)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.19,"if one did so, he should burn it -"," The popular texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> use the word ישפך - ""pour it out."" However, most of the original manuscripts state ישרף as in our text. This version implies that it is feared that the flour has already leavened and, hence, must be burnt."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.19,because it will cause [the flour] to become leavened very fast. --," In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 2:8), the Rambam explains that the vinegar in the charoset causes the flour to become leavened fast."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.20,It is permissible to place spices --," Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 455:6) advises against placing spices in dough. The Ramah forbids matzah that was kneaded with pepper, maintaining that its sharpness causes the dough to become leavened."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.20,and the like --," Salt is not included in this category. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (455:5) explicitly advises against placing salt into dough, and the Ramah considers matzah baked with salt as chametz."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.20,"Similarly, it is permissible to knead the dough with water and oil, honey or milk, or to baste with them --"," This statement has raised controversy. In Halachah 2, when the Rambam described the use of מי פירות, he explained that they will not cause grain products to become leavened when used alone. However, if they are mixed with water, they can cause the grain products to become leavened. Indeed, the commentaries relate that the mixture of these liquids with water speeds up the leavening process.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Ra'avad and other authorities question the leniency granted by the Rambam. In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:2) advises against, but does not forbid, mixing these liquids with water. The Ramah (and accordingly, Ashkenazic custom) prohibits such a mixture entirely.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> substitutes the word יין (wine) for מים (water). According to such a rendition, there is no difficulty."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.20,it is forbidden to knead or baste --," even though basting the dough with other substances will not change its taste appreciably, the Rambam forbids this. See <i>Or Sameach</i>."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.21,All earthenware vessels --," In this and the following five halachot, the Rambam discusses how dishes and cooking utensils that were used for chametz during the entire year may be prepared for Passover use. It must be emphasized that in many communities, it is customary not to consider these options and to use separate sets of pots, dishes, and cutlery for the holiday."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.21,may --, only
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.21,except for the utensils --," Leavening agents were placed directly in these utensils.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.21,"were placed, for their leavening effect is powerful --"," Yeast is a powerful leavening agent. Similarly, the vinegar in the charoset will cause leavening. Even though the utensil was cleaned thoroughly of these substances, we regard that some was absorbed in the utensil's walls and will have an effect on food placed within it on Pesach."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.22,An earthenware roasting pan on which loaves of chametz are baked during the entire year should not be used to bake matzah on Pesach --," The prohibition is obvious. It appears that this statement was included only as an introduction to the following halachah, which describes how such a utensil may be prepared for Pesach use."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.23,Metal and stone utensils --," In <i>Hilchot Ma'acholot Asurot</i> 17:3 and in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 7:12), the Rambam equates glass utensils with those made of these substances."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.23,"e.g., pots and stew pots --", The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 451:5) requires that the surface of the pot be smooth and free of nicks or cracks for this manner of purging to be effective.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.23,"They should be covered with water, and the water should be boiled --", The commentaries stress how the water must be bubbling because of the heat.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.23,until they release [what they absorbed] --," This phrase is taken from the <i>halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchak Alfasi. However, it is omitted in some of the Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. In practice, there is also debate about this issue. In his responsum, the Rashbah explains Rav Yitzchak Alfasi's view, stating that a person should leave the utensil submerged until he feels that all the absorbed chametz has been released. However, the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 121) and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> do not require waiting any substantial amount of time. Their view is accepted by the later authorities. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 452:4.)"

<p>Similarly, [with regard to] knives, the blade — <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:7 states: ""A person who acquires a knife from a gentile must burn it out in fire."" A similar decision is rendered by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 121:7). Nevertheless, the authorities suggest that chametz may be purged from knives by boiling. However, they do not permit this leniency in the following instances:</p>
<p>a) when the knives are rusty;</p>
<p>b) when they have serrated edges;</p>
<p>c) when the handle is separate from the blade and enclosed around it, allowing for the possibility for residue to collect between them.</p>
<p>In the latter instance, even ליבון (exposing the knife to open fire) is insufficient. Since most knives today are made in this manner, they should not be kashered for Pesach or for ordinary use after having been used with prohibited foods. Both the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> state that purchasing new knives for Pesach is the most desirable manner of fulfilling the mitzvah."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.24,"Utensils of metal, stone, and wood which were used for chametz as a", כלי שני — a utensil into which one pours water that had been cooked over a fire.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.24,should be placed in a large utensil and boiling water poured over them --," from a utensil that was heated on the fire. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 451:6) states that, at present, it is customary to boil all utensils on the fire itself (i.e., in a כלי ראשון), even though they were generally used as a כלי שני."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.24,"Afterwards, they should be washed off --", as explained in the previous halachah.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.25,water --," In contrast to utensils made of other substances, the process of הגעלה cannot remove the forbidden matter absorbed in the walls of an earthenware vessel. Instead of all the absorbed matter being purged at once, it is released a small amount at a time, and there will always be a certain quantity of the previous substance contained in its walls.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> 30b explains that this concept is derived from the Torah itself. <a href=""/9907#v21"">Leviticus 6:21</a> states that any pot in which meat from a sin offering has been cooked must be broken. A sin offering can only be eaten for one day. Once that time has passed, the taste of the meat absorbed in the pot is considered as נותר (sacrificial meat which has been kept past its required time), and thus forbidden. Hence, the pot itself must be destroyed."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.25,or they were of simple earthenware --," As mentioned in Halachah 22, the Sages also forbade the use of ןוביל (exposing the utensil to fire), to remove chametz absorbed in most earthenware vessels, lest a person hesitate to expose them to the required heat out of fear that they would break. Thus, there is no way to prepare these utensils for Pesach use. Therefore,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.25,"Rather, we put them aside until after Pesach --"," Though the taste of chametz is absorbed in the walls of these utensils, keeping them does not cause a person to violate the prohibition against possessing chametz on Pesach. Nevertheless, at present, when it is customary to sell chametz to gentiles, the Rabbis in charge of the sale usually sell this chametz as well."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.26,[A person possesses a utensil which is] a כלי ראשון," and desires to boil it [in order to prepare it for Passover use] — and hence must be kashered by boiling water inside of it, as explained in Halachah 23."

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 452:6) offers an alternative suggestion. After boiling the water thoroughly, placing a very hot stone into the water will cause the water to flow over the edges of the utensil on all sides. Thus, the entire utensil will be exposed to the boiling water."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.1",How many shofar blasts is a person required to hear on Rosh Hashanah -, according to Torah law?

In both cases, the verb means ""cause to pass."" From that expression, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid., derives that a long note should be sounded before the תרועה.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the text <i>Galia Masechta</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 3) explains that the essential element of the mitzvah is the <i>teru'ah</i>, since that is the sound specifically required by the Torah. The <i>teki'ot</i> are required only as a supplementary factor."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.1","all the soundings of the shofar of the seventh month, are a single entity. -"," Thus, on each occasion, the same three series of blasts must be sounded."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.1",teru'ah -," a blast which is interrupted into shorter sounds, as described in Halachot 2-4."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.2","Over the passage of the years and throughout the many exiles, doubt has been raised concerning the teru'ah which the Torah mentions, to the extent that we do not know what it is. -"," <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34a explains that our custom of blowing the shofar was instituted by Rabbi Abahu in Caesaria approximately one hundred years after the destruction of the second Temple. In this halachah, the Rambam explains the reason for Rabbi Abahu's action.</p>
<p>The Rambam's statements are accepted by Rabbenu Asher, Rabbenu Nissim, and most other authorities. Nevertheless, it is significant that Rav Hai Gaon, one of the major authorities who preceded the Rambam, offers a different explanation for Rabbi Abahu's actions.</p>
<p>Rav Hai Gaon maintains that it is impossible that a doubt existed among the Jewish people concerning such an important manner as sounding the shofar. Since the shofar was sounded each year, surely the tradition could have been maintained. Hence, he explains that all the different manners of sounding the shofar were acceptable and that Rabbi Abahu's contribution was the establishment of a uniform custom that included all the different practices common among the Jewish people. By mentioning the ""many years"" and ""exiles,"" the Rambam addresses himself to the question raised by Rav Hai Gaon."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.2",when they moan -," The word <i>teru'ah</i> is translated into Aramaic as <i>yevavah</i> (moan), as in <a href=""/15813#v28"">Judges 5:28</a>: ""Sisra's mother gazed out the window and moaned through the lattice."""

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.3","is as follows: First, one recites the blessing -", as explained in Halachah 10.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.3",He repeats this pattern [until he completes] three series. -," in order to have heard the three series of blasts required by Halachah 1.</p>
<p>Although the pattern of shofar blowing described by the Rambam has become universally accepted among the Jewish people, it is unclear when this practice was first instituted. One of the fundamental texts of the period directly following the conclusion of the Talmud, the <i>Sh'eltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon (note 171), mentions a different practice.</p>
<p>Three series of blasts from each pattern are not blown directly after each other. Rather, after sounding three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>, three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>, and then three series of <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> is sounded."

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.3",He repeats this pattern [until he completes] three series. -, as explained above.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.4",The required length of a teru'ah is that of two teki'ot. -," These statements are the source of much controversy among the Rabbis. The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b) states: ""The required length of the <i>teki'ah</i> is three <i>teru'ot</i>; a <i>teru'ah</i> is three sobs.""</p>
<p>The Talmud questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the <i>baraita</i> has taught: ""the required length of a <i>teki'ah</i> is that of a <i>teru'ah</i>!""</p>
<p>Abbaye replied: ""The author of the Mishnah considered the length of all the <i>teki'ot</i> in comparison to the length of all the <i>teru'ot</i>. The author of the <i>baraita</i> considered the length of each blast. There is no difference of opinion between them.""</p>

<p>In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam interprets the above to mean: ""The required length of all six <i>teki'ot</i> is equivalent to the required length of all three <i>teru'ot</i>,"" thus establishing each <i>teru'ah</i> as twice the length of a <i>teki'ah</i>. Hence, according to the Rambam, the length of the <i>teki'ot</i> are dependent on the length of the <i>teru'ot</i>.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Nissim objects to the Rambam's interpretation, explaining that the word והעברת, the verb mentioned in the commandment to blow the shofar, implies a long blast, and hence the measure mentioned by the Rambam would not be appropriate.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Ra'avad does not accept the Rambam's interpretation, and explains that the Mishnah establishes an independent measure for the length of a <i>teki'ah</i> - three <i>teru'ot</i> - with each <i>teru'ah</i> being equal to three short sobs. Thus, the measure of a <i>teki'ah</i> is equivalent to nine short sounds. The Ramban and the Rashba also subscribe to this view.</p>
<p>Rashi and most Ashkenazic authorities accept the simple meaning of the Mishnah and explain that a <i>teki'ah</i> is equal to the length of a <i>teru'ah</i>. However, as explained in the previous halachot, there are three different interpretations of the definition of a <i>teru'ah</i>. Thus, the required length for the <i>teki'ah</i> varies accordingly.</p>
<p>Regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:3) mentions the views of Rashi and the Ra'avad, but not that of the Rambam."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.4","When a person sounds a teki'ah and a teru'ah, and afterwards sounds a long teki'ah, extending it twice the length of the original one -", with the intention that it be considered to be the final blast of the first series and the initial blast of the following series
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.4",thus allowing one [to complete the series merely by] sounding a teru'ah and another teki'ah. -," This represents a rephrasing of the Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:9 and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.5",If a person hears one shofar blast at one hour and a second one an hour later - even if he waits the entire day -," <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34a-b quotes Rabbi Yochanan: ""If a person heard the nine shofar blasts even over a span of nine hours, he fulfills his obligation."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.5",and he may fulfill his obligation. -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 588:2) quotes this law. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (588:2) compares this situation to the laws of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 65:1) and explains that if one is prevented from hearing the shofar by forces beyond one's control, it is considered to be an interruption and one must begin the last series of blasts anew."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.6",If a person heard nine shofar blasts from nine men simultaneously -," At the same time, six blew <i>teki'ot</i> and three, <i>teru'ot</i>, so that the person could have heard the required number of shofar blasts"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.6","[If he heard] a teki'ah from one, a teru'ah from another, and another teki'ah from a third, in sequence, he has fulfilled his obligation. -", The fact that different people sounded the shofar does not prevent the fulfillment of the mitzvah.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.6","A person does not fulfill his obligation until he hears all nine shofar blasts, for they are all [only] one mitzvah. -", as explained in Halachah 1.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.7",The congregation - but not an individual (,<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34b)
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.7",together with the order of blessings. -," <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16b explains that the Sages instituted the blowing of the shofar in the midst of the prayer service in order to confuse Satan, lest he lodge accusations against the Jews in the midst of their prayers. The Sages explain (ibid., 32b) that it would have been appropriate to institute the shofar blowing in the morning service. However, the Romans desired to stamp out the performance of the mitzvot and sent guards to make sure that the mitzvah was not fulfilled. After midday, the guards left, and then, in the musaf service, the shofar would be sounded.</p>
<p>Originally, the Sages' decree involved determining the place of the service when the mitzvah required by the Torah would be fulfilled and this halachah must be interpreted in that context. However, as explained in Halachot 11 and 12, it became universally accepted Jewish custom to blow the shofar before the musaf prayers to fulfill the Torah's commandment, and thus ""confuse the Satan"" even before the beginning of our prayers, and then to sound the shofar again in the midst of those prayers to fulfill the Rabbinic decree. See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 592:7."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.7",Gevurot -," literally, ""mighty acts""; the second blessing of the <i>Amidah</i>, which begins: ""You are mighty,"" and recounts different expressions of God's power."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.7",Malchuyot -," Three additional blessings are recited in the musaf service of Rosh Hashanah: <i>Malchuyot</i> (acceptance of God's sovereignty), <i>Zichronot</i> (acknowledgement of God's remembrance of the Jewish people), and <i>Shofarot</i> (describing the significance of the sounding of the shofar).</p>
<p><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16a states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, declares: ""On Rosh Hashanah, recite before me <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot</i>.</p>
<p><i>Malchuyot</i> - so that you will crown Me as King over you.</p>
<p><i>Zichronot</i> - so that I will remember you for good.</p>
<p>By what means? Through the shofar.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These blessings are described in the following halachot.</p>
<p>The prayers mentioning the sacred nature of the holiday and the sacrifices which were offered in the Temple are also included in the <i>Malchuyot</i> blessing."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.7",Zichronot - the shofar is sounded three times -," the second series of <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> required by the Torah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.7",[and concludes the the Amidah with] the Avodah -," literally, ""the service,"" i.e., the blessing <i>R'tzey</i>, which asks God to accept our prayers and restore the Temple service."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.8",These three intermediate blessings recited on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur of the Yovel -," The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b) states: ""Rosh Hashanah and the <i>Yovel</i> are identical regarding the sounding of the shofar and the blessings."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.8",are each dependent on each other. -," i.e., a person who cannot recite all three blessings should not recite any. Generally, a person who does not know all the blessings of the <i>Amidah</i> should recite those that he knows. However, on the musaf service of Rosh Hashanah, a person should begin the <i>Amidah</i> only if he knows the entire service (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 593:2). (See also the <i>Bi'ur Halachah</i>.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.8",reflecting the content of the blessing -, as explained in the commentary on the previous halachah
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.8","three from the Book of Psalms, and three from [the words of] the prophets. -"," The commentaries question why the Book of Psalms is given prominence over the words of the prophets, when generally the prophets' statements are considered on a higher level of holiness. Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that chronologically, the Psalms were written before the prophecies quoted (<i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a).</p>
<p>Examples of the verses recited are mentioned in the following halachah and commentary."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.8","Should a person conclude with a verse from the prophets, he fulfills his obligation. -"," However, one should preferably conclude with a verse from the Torah. This is our present practice.</p>
<p>From the statements of the Rambam and the relevant passages from the Mishnah and Talmud, it would appear that originally there was no standard text containing universally accepted verses for these blessings. Rather, certain verses were commonly accepted and would be recited by almost all those who prayed. Others were left to the preference of each individual.</p>
<p>(One must remember that machzorim were uncommon in this period, and most of the prayers were recited by heart. Thus, the verses chosen by an individual might often have been those which he had been able to commit to memory.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.8",he fulfills his obligation. -," after the fact. However, at the outset it is desirable to recite all ten verses."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.9","One should not recite [verses for] Malchuyot, Zichronot, and Shofarot which describe [Divine] retribution -"," Since Rosh Hashanah is a day of judgement, we are careful not to mention any factors that might lead to negative repercussions. For this reason, no confessional prayers are recited on Rosh Hashanah, and extreme care is taken regarding all aspects of our prayers and speech. (See Maharsha, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.9","for Malchuyot, [<a href=""/16118#v33"">Ezekiel 20:33</a>]: ""With outpoured anger, I will reign over you..."" -"," <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a mentions that this prophecy concludes with the redemption of our people; since it is associated with anger and wrath, it is not fit to be mentioned on Rosh Hashanah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.9","Similarly, Zichronot which are merely associated with an individual [should not be mentioned] even if they are of a positive nature - for example, [<a href=""/16327#v4"">Psalms 106:4</a>]: ""Remember me, O God, amidst the favor of Your people""; [<a href=""/16512#v19"">Nehemiah 5:19</a>]: ""Remember me, my God, for good."" -"," Even though on Rosh Hashanah each man is judged individually, and his own personal future is determined (see <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16b; <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:3), it is desirable to look beyond these individual matters and concentrate our prayers on the welfare of the Jewish people as a whole."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.9",may not be included as Zichronot. -," The meaning of פקד is often ""remember."" Indeed, the Targum of the cited verse in Genesis is דכיר, the Aramaic for ""remembered."" Furthermore, the Talmud mentions that Rabbi Yosse allowed verses using the verb פקד, and although Rabbi Yehudah objected, in differences of opinion between the two, Rabbi Yosse's position is generally favored. Nevertheless, since there are many verses that use the verb זכר, there is no difficulty in establishing a practice that will be accepted by all opinions (<i>Beit Yosef</i> 591)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.9","All the following verses: [<a href=""/9970#v4"">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>]: ""Hear Israel, God is our God, God is one""; [<a href=""/9968#v35"">Deuteronomy 4:35</a>]: ""To you, it has been revealed that you may know...""; and [<a href=""/9968#v39"">Deuteronomy 4:39</a>]: ""And you shall know today and draw it close to your heart..."" express the concept of God's sovereignty. -"," These verses all express the oneness of God and creation; thus they emphasize how ""He is unique and one, with none that compare to Him. His Kingship permeating all dominion."" (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 591:11)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.10",The following is the commonly accepted custom for blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah -," As mentioned in Halachah 7 and the commentary, the Sages had originally ordained that a person hear the shofar blasts required by the Torah in the midst of the musaf service. However, as evident from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16a-b, even in Talmudic times the custom mentioned by the Rambam was already the general practice."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.10",After the Torah is read -," <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 13:10 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The common custom is to read on the first day: ""And God showed providence to Sarah..., and on the second day: ""And God presented a trial to Abraham...""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated in that halachah, the haftarah is recited after the Torah reading is concluded."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.10",the congregation is seated. -," This practice is mentioned in <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16a and the <i>Sh'eltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon. However, today it is Ashkenazic custom to stand when hearing these shofar blasts. Nevertheless, based on this original practice, these are still referred to as <i>teki'ot meiyoshav</i> - ""the <i>teki'ot</i> sounded while seated."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.10",and recites the blessing -," as required before the fulfillment of any positive commandment (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:1,2,8)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.10","The entire congregation responds ""Amen."" He then recites the blessing shehecheyanu -", as is necessary before the fulfillment of any mitzvah performed infrequently (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:9).
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.10",Kaddish is recited. -," ""The chazan always recites Kaddish before and after every prayer service (Rambam, <i>Seder Tefillot kol Shanah</i>)."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.10",and recites the musaf service. -," in a hushed tone.</p>
<p>The <i>Tur</i> relates that there were varying customs regarding the recitation of the musaf service in a hushed tone. In certain communities, it had been customary for the congregation to recite the musaf prayers as on other festivals without reciting <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot</i>. Only the chazan would recite the latter. However, even in the <i>Tur's</i> time, the prevailing custom was that even the congregation recited these three blessings.</p>
<p>The <i>Sh'lah</i> records the custom of sounding the shofar for <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot,</i> and <i>Shofarot</i> while the congregation recites the <i>Amidah</i>. However, this custom is not accepted in all communities."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.11",The person who sounds the shofar while they are sitting -, the thirty shofar blasts mentioned in Halachah 3.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.11",while they stand. -," Rav Hai Gaon also mentions this practice. The <i>Kolbo</i> explains that it is appropriate, since ""when a person begins a mitzvah, we tell him to complete it"" (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 1:8). Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 592:7 writes that in many communities, it has become customary to divide the honor of shofar blowing between two individuals."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.11",should not speak -, Permission is granted to speak about matters required for the prayers or for blowing the shofar (Ramah).
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.12",It is logical that each series of shofar blasts should be sounded three times for every blessing -," Because of the doubt mentioned in Halachah 3, it would be proper for us to blow three series of blasts - i.e., <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah; teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>; and <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - at the conclusion of each blessing."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.12","However, since they -", the congregation
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.12","[by hearing] the shofar while seated, there is no need for the congregation to repeat them -", these shofar blasts
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.12","and thus, they will have heard the shofar during the order of blessings -"," and fulfilled the requirement of the Sages mentioned in Halachah 7.</p>
<p>In practice, a number of different customs are followed regarding this matter. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 592:1) suggests following the pattern described by the Rambam, but sounding each series three times, rather than once. The Ramah writes that Ashkenazic custom is to sound one series - <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - after each blessing. However, the <i>Sh'lah</i> suggests blowing three series of blasts - i.e., <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah; teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>; and <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - at the conclusion of each blessing."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.12","However, there is no [set] custom regarding an individual. He fulfills his obligation whether or not he hears [the shofar blasts] during the order of blessings -"," Some authorities object to the permission granted by the Rambam for an individual to interrupt his recitation of the the <i>Amidah</i> in order to hear the sounding of the shofar. However, the Rambam's opinion is based on his interpretation of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34b. (See <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.13",The blessings -," <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot,</i> and <i>Shofarot</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.13",nor are the teki'ot dependent on the blessings. -," Thus, if it is impossible for a person to hear the blessings, he should still attempt to hear the shofar being blown."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.13","but there is no one to blow the shofar - in the other, a doubt exists whether or not there will be someone to blow the shofar, one should go the latter, since the sounding of the shofar is a requirement of the Torah -"," as mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 1"

The definitions of the various domains with regard to the Sabbath laws are found in Chapter 14."

Sabbath 12.9,"placed it down [after taking it from the hand of the person who removed it,] but did not remove it [himself], or -"," In the example cited above, since the poor man did not pick the article up (עקירה), he is not liable.

Human Dispositions 5.1,Just as the wise man -," This term provides the key to this chapter. Throughout the chapter, the Rambam uses the term <i>talmid chacham</i> (Torah Sage). However, he begins the chapter by using the term, <i>chacham</i> (wise man), to refer to his statements in Chapter 1, Halachot 4-5, which describe a wise man as one who constantly evaluates his behavior and follows the desired middle path."
Human Dispositions 5.1,"As mentioned in the commentary to the first chapter, in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i>, the Rambam puts a far greater stress on a person's emulation of God's ""attributes"" and less to the emulation of His deeds. Therefore, the first three chapters emphasize the importance of personality development and the methods with which we can refine our character traits. This chapter concludes the treatment of the mitzvah to emulate God and focuses on the ""good deeds"" that reflect the process of inner refinement described above.<br/>",
Human Dispositions 5.1,"In Chapter 4, he outlines a regimen of behavior that allows man to reach the first goal. In this chapter, he concentrates on the second and more complete purpose.<br/>",

Human Dispositions 5.1,All of these actions should be becoming and befitting.<br/>,
Human Dispositions 5.1,"should not be a glutton. Rather, he should eat food which will keep his body healthy, -"," as described in the previous chapter. Furthermore, even when eating these foods, he should not overindulge."
Human Dispositions 5.1,"He should not seek to fill his stomach, like those who stuff themselves with food and drink until their bellies burst. -"," The Rambam underlines the negative aspects of the tendency to overindulge and gorge oneself on food by using an extreme example. See also the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 8, where he compares people who pursue gluttony to a slave who revels in dung."
Human Dispositions 5.1,Our Sages -, <i>Shabbat</i> 151b
Human Dispositions 5.1,"They say, ""Eat and drink for tomorrow, we will die."""," This statement is found in <a href=""/15953#v13"">Isaiah 22:13</a>. However, the Rambam is not quoting the verse as a support, he is merely borrowing the expression to exemplify an existential search for pleasure."
Human Dispositions 5.2,"When the wise man eats the little, which is fitting for him, he should eat it only in his own home at his table, -"," The previous halachah discussed the quantity of food and the attitude with which it was to be eaten. The present halachah concerns itself with the place and the company in which the wise should eat. It revolves around the principle that a person should be modest while eating and refrain from doing so in public. (See the Guide to the Perplexed, ibid.)"
Human Dispositions 5.2,"or in the marketplace, -"," Though the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ma'aserot</i> 3:2 mentions this prohibition in reference to a Torah Sage, the Babylonian Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 40b condemns even a common person for such behavior, stating: ""Whoever eats in the marketplace is like a dog."" The passage in <i>Kiddushin</i> continues to explain that such a person is unacceptable as a witness and the Rambam quotes that law (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 11:5).</p>
<p>The commentaries have attempted to resolve this difficulty in different ways: For example <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> (ibid.) explains that a common person is condemned only if he eats a full meal in the market place, while a wise man should not eat anything at all in public. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Edut</i>) differentiates between eating in a crowded place - which is forbidden for everyone - and eating in a quiet corner - which is deemed improper only for a Sage. The <i>Bach</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 34) explains that a common person is censored only for eating while walking through the market place, while the wise man should not eat in public even while standing in one place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this halachah, the Rambam uses the expression <i>chacham</i> (a wise man), his ideal for a person with a developed personality, and not <i>talmid chacham</i> (a Torah Sage). Apparently, he does not differentiate between a Torah Sage and a common person in this matter and requires a refined, highly developed standard in meeting our physical needs from everyone."
Human Dispositions 5.2,"He should not eat together with the unlearned, -"," <i>Sanhedrin</i> 52b states that, at the outset, a common person will consider a Torah Sage to be like a vessel of gold. However, if the Sage derives benefit from the common person, he will come to regard the Sage like an earthenware shard.</p>
<p>Note <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11, where the Rambam equates the dining of a learned and pious man together with the unlearned with the desecration of the Name of God. See also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> (25:4) where he rules that communal leaders and judges should not eat and drink with the common people."
Human Dispositions 5.2,He -, the wise man
Human Dispositions 5.2,"even in the company of wise men, nor should he eat where there is a large gathering. -"," The reason for these restrictions is, as the Rambam expresses in the Guide to the Perplexed (ibid.), a basic desire for a person, particularly when he relates to others, to emphasize the refined and developed aspects of his being and not those which he shares with other animals. Therefore, even when there is no danger of subjecting himself to undesirable influences or disgracing the Torah with which he is identified, he should refrain from performing a physical activity like eating in the presence of others."
Human Dispositions 5.2,"e.g., a betrothal -"," This decision is not accepted by all authorities. Some do not consider such a betrothal feast as ""associated with a mitzvah.""</p>
<p><i>Erusin</i> translated as ""betrothal,"" refers to the first stage of the marriage process, i.e., giving the woman the wedding ring. In Talmudic and post-Talmudic times, this ceremony was carried out before the actual wedding (<i>nisuin</i>). At present, we perform the two stages of the wedding, <i>erusin</i> and <i>nisuin</i> together. Thus, reference to what we term engagement as <i>erusin</i> is technically a misnomer."
Human Dispositions 5.3,"Whoever becomes drunk is a sinner, -"," The commentaries cite <i>Berachot</i> 29b: ""Do not become drunk and do not sin;"" a passage which seems to say that drink leads to sins. There is room for question for it appears that the Rambam views drinking itself as sinful."
Human Dispositions 5.3,and will lose his wisdom. -," See <a href=""/16402#v5"">Proverbs 31:5</a>: ""Lest he drink and forget the Law and pervert the judgement of all the poor.""</p>
<p>The Torah gives examples of the degrading effects of drunkenness (Noah, Genesis, Chapter 8; Lot, Genesis, Chapter 19). There are specific prohibitions against drinking - e.g. a priest is not allowed to perform the priestly services while under the influence of alcohol (<a href=""/9911#v9"">Leviticus 10:9</a>-11). Similarly, numerous passages throughout the Prophets and Sacred Writings castigate drunkenness. These are also paralleled in the rabbinic literature, e.g. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70a, <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 12."
Human Dispositions 5.3,It is forbidden to drink even a small quantity of wine -," Note <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:17 which considers a <i>revi'it</i> (between 3 and 5 oz.) of wine as slightly intoxicating. Since our wines are considerably weaker than those of the Rambam's time, it is questionable whether this measure would apply today."
Human Dispositions 5.3,unless it is taken together with food because drink that is taken together with food is not intoxicating -," to the same degree as wine that is drunk without food. See the Rambam's commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:6."
Human Dispositions 5.4,it is fitting that a wise man behave with holiness. -," Though a Jew's commitment to holiness must encompass every aspect of his behavior, the Torah and our Sages have always emphasized the importance of this quality in regard to sexuality. There is no more powerful expression of man's basic, instinctual nature than sex. Therefore, precisely in this area, a Jew must reveal that his nature is not only material, that he possesses a spiritual dimension that lies at the core of his being and seeks expression.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Jewish marriage bond is referred to as <i>Kiddushin</i>, emphasizing how <i>kedushah</i>, holiness, is a fundamental element in marriage. Similarly, <a href=""/9921#v7"">Leviticus 20:7</a>, proclaims ""Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am God, your Lord,"" as a preface to the laws proscribing forbidden intimate relations. <i>Sh'vuot</i> 18b interprets the above verse as also including a command to conduct oneself in a holy manner within permitted relationships.</p>
<p>The quality of holiness involves not only restraint, as mentioned in the ensuing statements, but also the manner in which relations are carried out. The Rambam elaborates on this aspect in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:9 and in his commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4."
Human Dispositions 5.4,"Rather, [he should limit his relations to once a week] -"," <i>Ketubot</i> 62a,b describes the frequency with which people involved in different occupations should engage in intimate relations (See also <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 14:1-4.). The measure given here is the one allotted to Torah Sages."
Human Dispositions 5.4,"<i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> (attributed to the Ramban) emphasizes that on the Sabbath, a person is granted a greater spiritual potential which enables him to maintain his bond with God even when involved in physical activities.<br/>",
Human Dispositions 5.4,"with her, he should not do so at the beginning of the night, when he is sated and his belly [is] full, nor at the end of the night, when he is hungry; rather, in the middle of the night, when his food has been digested. -"," Note Chapter 4, Halachah 19. <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> explains that both during the time food is being digested and when a person is hungry, his emotional balance is somewhat disturbed and it is difficult for him to develop the proper attitude and spiritual awareness necessary to make intimate relations a Godly act.</p>
<p><i>Nedarim</i> 20b emphasizes that the midnight hour also allows a person to rest from all his worldly involvement. The quiet of the hour prevents him from being disturbed by other thoughts and he is able to concentrate on his wife alone.</p>
<p>Despite the advantages of having relations at midnight, many contemporary authorities suggest that a couple not hold to this as a binding rule. If a couple have already begun thinking of sex, they should not be forced to wait until midnight to fulfill their desires.</p>
<p>He should not be excessively lightheaded, - Previously (Chapter 2, Halachah 7), the Rambam cited a mishnah (<i>Avot</i> 3:16) which links lightheadedness and immorality."

Human Dispositions 5.4,"nor lackadaisical, -"," People should not engage in relations except when motivated by desire (preferably a holy desire as explained in Chapter 3). For this reason, as mentioned below, a husband should spend time arousing his wife's desires."
Human Dispositions 5.4,"[neither both of them,] or [even] one of them. -"," The act of intimacy should be a true union between man and wife. Therefore, the partners must work on developing a single state of mind."
Human Dispositions 5.4,against her will. -, The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that this statement also implies that one should not compel his wife to agree to intimate relations. See <i>Eiruvin</i> 100b.
Human Dispositions 5.4,so that she be relaxed. -," <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;""><b>You should motivate her with words that move her heart and settle her mind and make her happy so that your mind will be fused with hers, and your intent with her intent.<br/>
You should say some things that arouse her desire, feelings of connection, love, will, and romance, and others which lead her to the fear of God, piety, and modesty.<br/></b>"
Human Dispositions 5.5,"Whoever conducts himself in this manner [may be assured that] not only does he sanctify his soul, purify himself, and refine his character, but, furthermore, -"," in addition to these spiritual and ethical benefits,..."
Human Dispositions 5.5,they -, the offspring
Human Dispositions 5.5,"and modest, worthy of wisdom and piety. -"," <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">When a person joins together with his wife while his thoughts cleave to the spiritual realms, those thoughts draw down a sublime light which rests on that drop of semen... Thus, that drop of semen is always connected to that shining light.<br/>
This is the mystic secret implied in [God's words to the prophet, <a href=""/15998#v5"">Jeremiah, (1:5)</a>]: ""Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you;"" i.e., He had already established a connection of shining light with the sperm [from which] that Tzaddik [was conceived] at the time of [his parents'] union."
Human Dispositions 5.6,Torah Sages conduct themselves with exceptional modesty. -," With this statement, the Rambam establishes a connection with the previous halachah and sets the motif for what follows. Modesty is not simply a matter of dress, (this is discussed in halachah 9), but rather, an awareness of God which causes a person to cover head and body out of respect for the Divine Presence. The Rambam expands upon this concept in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Vol. III, Chapter 52):</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">He is constantly with us, observing us, as [<a href=""/16020#v24"">Jeremiah 23:24</a>] proclaims: 'Can a man hide himself in the secret places and I not see him,' says God."" Understand this well.<br/>
Know that when perfect men comprehend this, they achieve such humility, such awe and fear of God and a sense of shame before Him... that their private behavior with their wives and in latrines is like their public conduct with other people.<br/>
Know that they have forbidden a man to walk with an erect carriage, because: ""the entire world is filled with His glory"" (<a href=""/15937#v3"">Isaiah 6:3)</a>... We are always in His presence... Thus, the greatest among the Sages found it difficult to bare their heads because the Divine Presence constantly hovers over man."
Human Dispositions 5.6,or their bodies. -," The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (2:1) lays down the following general rule: Any portion of our bodies which is usually covered should not be revealed unless there is a specific reason for doing so.</p>
<p>Modesty, as understood in the present context, results from the awareness of the Divine Presence. The ordinary man experiences such awareness while at prayer when ""he is as if standing before the Divine Presence"" (<i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:16) and then he is required not to bare his head (ibid. 5:5) or various parts of his body; e.g., his chest (ibid. 4:7) and his feet (ibid. 5:5). As emphasized in Chapter 3, Halachah 3, a wise man should try to be conscious of the Divine Presence at all times and places. As a result, he will constantly be modest.</p>
<p>Though in Talmudic times and in the Rambam's era, personal modesty and covering one's head were considered the signs of a Sage (<i>Kiddushin</i> 8a) and a unique and special merit (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b), at present, both practices have been accepted as ordinary behavior for all observant Jews.</p>
<p>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. - <i>Tamid</i> 27b quotes Rav as giving his son the following advice: ""Sit and reveal yourself. Cover yourself and stand."""
Human Dispositions 5.6,"He should stay away from all others and enter a chamber beyond a chamber, a cave within a cave, and relieve himself. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 62b derives this law from <a href=""/15853#v3"">I Samuel 24:3</a>'s description of the behavior of King Saul. Though it is forbidden to delay relieving oneself (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:31), our Sages did not give this prohibition precedence over the dictates of modesty (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 3:11)."
Human Dispositions 5.6,he [must] relieve himself -, These restrictions only apply to defecation. The Sages feared that refraining from urination might be damaging (<i>Bechorot</i> 44b).
Human Dispositions 5.6,"If he [must] relieve himself in an open area, -", where such a barrier is not available
Human Dispositions 5.6,"One should not speak while relieving himself, even if there is great need. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 62a states that ""modesty and silence are appropriate for the latrine."" <i>Sanhedrin</i> 19a states that women are allowed to speak in the latrine to prevent men from entering."
Sabbath 7.1,With regard to the [forbidden] labors for which one is liable to be executed by stoning -," when a forbidden labor is performed in the presence of witnesses who administer a warning (Chapter 1, Halachah 1)"
Sabbath 7.1,"or for which one is obligated to bring a sin offering if one commits the transgression unknowingly, -"," i.e., one intended to perform the forbidden labor, but was not aware that doing so was breaking the Sabbath laws."
Sabbath 7.1,The sum of all the primary categories of [forbidden] labor are forty minus one. -," The commentaries question why the Rambam (and his source, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2, use this expression, rather than merely stating ""thirty-nine."" Some draw attention to the parallel found in the Mishnah's description of the number of lashes given a transgressor (<i>Makkot</i> 3:10). Others explain that this expression indicates that there is a fortieth activity - the spiritual service of prayer and study - which must be performed on the Sabbath day."
Sabbath 7.1,"sowing, -"," Significantly, plowing is mentioned before sowing in the Mishnah. <i>Shabbat</i> 73b explains that this was done to teach that if the earth is hard, and it is necessary to re-plow the land after the first plowing, one is liable for the second plowing as well. The Rambam, however, follows the usual order of activities. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)"
Sabbath 7.1,collecting sheaves -," In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that the reapers usually gather the grain in small sheaves. Others follow who collect these sheaves into larger bundles. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 5.)</p>
<p>According to one opinion in <i>Shabbat</i> 96b, there is an explicit reference to the prohibition of this labor on the Sabbath. Numbers, ch. 15, relates that a person was executed for collecting wood on the Sabbath. As the Rambam states Chapter 21, Halachah 11, this labor includes only the collection of produce. Gathering other substances - e.g., salt - is not included. It is, however, forbidden by Rabbinic decree."
Sabbath 7.1,winnowing -," casting the mixture of kernels and husks to the wind. The wind will blow away the chaff, while the kernels that are heavier will fall to the ground."
Sabbath 7.1,grinding -," crushing the kernels into flour. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 15.)"
Sabbath 7.1,kneading -," mixing the flour with water to create a dough. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 16.)"
Sabbath 7.1,shearing -," This and the following twelve labors are necessary for the preparation of fabric. Shearing involves removing hair or wool from an animal, whether dead or alive. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 7.)"
Sabbath 7.1,beating -," Unlike Rashi and others who interpret as combing the wool, in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah he translates the word into an Arabic term meaning ""beat it with a stick."" This activity is necessary as a preliminary stage of the preparation of flax to be spun into linen. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 12.)"
Sabbath 7.1,spinning -," intertwining the fibers to make thread. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 15.)"
Sabbath 7.1,mounting the warp -," See Chapter 9, Halachah 17-18, where the Rambam describes how a loom is set up. First, the threads of the warp are extended to the desired length and width. They are then attached to a rod on either side, and held taut. This is the activity referred to by this term."
Sabbath 7.1,undoing woven fabric -," See Chapter 9, Halachah 20."
Sabbath 7.1,untying -," This also includes untying only such knots. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 7.)"
Sabbath 7.1,tearing -," in order to sew. Otherwise, one is not liable. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 10.) If a hole was found in one of the curtains of the Sanctuary, it was cut open and sewn close (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 302:4)."
Sabbath 7.1,demolishing -," Here also the intent must be a constructive one: demolishing in order to rebuild. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 15.)"
Sabbath 7.1,trapping -," The Mishnah mentions the following seven categories as activities necessary to write a scroll. Leather hides were used to cover the roof of the Sanctuary. (See also Chapter 10, Halachah 19.)"
Sabbath 7.1,skinning -," the hide of an animal to use for leather. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 5.)"
Sabbath 7.1,removing hair -," For leather or parchment, smooth skin is required. (See also Chapter 11, Halachah 5, 6.)"
Sabbath 7.1,writing -," two letters. This activity was necessary in the Sanctuary, for a mark was made on the boards so that the same boards could be matched to each other each time they were attached together. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 9.)"
Sabbath 7.1,ruling lines -," For proper writing is possible only on ruled lines. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 17.) In the Sanctuary, this labor was performed to prepare the hides to be cut."
Sabbath 7.1,extinguishing a flame -," Here also, one's intent must be constructive - e.g., to use the charcoal produced. In the Sanctuary, this was necessary to produce an even flame for the fashioning of the metal utensils (See Chapter 12, Halachah 2.)"
Reading the Shema 3.1,One who recites the <i>Shema</i> should wash his hands with water -," Rabbi Yochanan says: A person who wants to accept upon himself the kingship of Heaven in the most complete fashion should see to his bodily needs, wash his hands, put on <i>tefillin</i>, recite the <i>Shema</i> and pray. Rav Chiyya bar Abba equates this process with the building of the altar and the bringing of sacrifices, based on the verse in <a href=""/16247#v6"">Psalms 26:6</a>: ""I wash my hands in innocence and I encompass Your altar, O God"" (<i>Berachot</i> 14a-15a)."
Reading the Shema 3.1,If the time for reciting the <i>Shema</i> arrives -," See Chapter 1, Halachah 11. According to the Rambam's position, this refers to ten minutes before sunrise. The differing opinions will interpret it to mean that the third hour of the morning will soon pass."
Reading the Shema 3.1,"Rather, he should clean his hands with earth, a stone, or a beam [of wood] -"," <i>Berachot</i> 15a explains that <a href=""/16247#v6"">Psalms 26:6</a>, the verse from which the obligation to wash is derived, does not state ""I wash my hands in water,"" but rather <i>binikayon</i>, in innocence or cleanliness. Thus, anything useful for cleaning the hands may be used, although water is most preferable."
Reading the Shema 3.2,One should not recite the <i>Shema</i> in a bathhouse -," When describing the proper environment for an army camp, <a href=""/9987#v15"">Deuteronomy 23:15</a> states: ""He shall not see any nakedness among you."" Implied is that nakedness, and also a place where people undress even if no naked people are there, is not appropriate for ""God to walk among you."" Hence, neither <i>Shema</i> nor the <i>Amidah</i> can be recited there. See halachot 16-19."
Reading the Shema 3.2,nor in a graveyard or next to a corpse. -," <i>Berachot</i> 18a. <a href=""/16388#v5"">Proverbs 17:5</a> states: ""The one who mocks the poor (<i>rash</i>) reproaches his Creator."" The Talmud also explains that this term also refers to the dead and derives many halachot regarding conduct in the presence of a corpse from this verse. It is forbidden to wear <i>tefillin</i> or carry a Torah scroll in a graveyard, since one would, in a certain sense, be mocking the dead, who are unable to perform mitzvot. This is the case regarding <i>Kri'at</i> Shema also."
Reading the Shema 3.3,"The <i>Shema</i> may be recited facing, but not inside,a latrine that has been newly built, but not used as of yet. -"," The designation alone of a building for such a purpose attaches a stigma to it such that it is unfit for the <i>Shema</i> to be recited inside it.</p>
<p><i>Shabbat</i> 10a raises the question of praying in such a building and does not resolve the issue. The Ra'avad therefore disagrees with the Rambam and feels that such a doubt should be dealt with leniently - i.e., that we should allow one to pray inside such a building."
Reading the Shema 3.3,"In the case of two buildings, one of which was designated for use as a latrine and, concerning the other, the owner said: ""And this..."" - a doubt remains regarding the latter: whether it also was appropriated for a similar use or not. -"," <i>Nedarim</i> 7a mentions this case within the context of the Talmudic concept of <i>yad</i> (“a handle”) of a vow or other significant utterance. This term refers to expressions that are not completely self-explanatory and leave room for doubt. Just as the handle of a cup is not the essential part of the cup, and yet when one grabs the handle the whole cup itself follows, so, too, a statement can be made which in itself is incomplete or unclear, but seems to contain within it an intimation of a complete idea. In our case, it is unclear whether the word וזה refers also to a latrine or to another idea altogether."
Reading the Shema 3.3,"However, after the fact, if he recited it there, he has fulfilled his obligation. -", Rav explains that this is based on the idea of ספק דרבנן לקולא (that a doubt concerning a rabbinic ordinance is dealt with leniently).
Reading the Shema 3.3,It is permissible to recite the <i>Shema</i> in the courtyard of the bathhouse -," In contrast to the previous cases in this halachah, this applies to the courtyard of a bathhouse which is being used."
Reading the Shema 3.4,"Not only Kri'at <i>Shema</i>, but nothing pertaining to matters of sanctity -"," e.g., Torah study or prayers,"
Reading the Shema 3.4,"Not only speech but even thoughts pertaining to the words of Torah are forbidden in a bathhouse, latrine or other unclean places -"," <a href=""/16233#v7"">Psalms 12:7</a> states: ""The words of God are pure words."" Therefore, it is improper for them to be uttered or contemplated in a place of filth (<i>Sefer Chassidim</i> 546)."
Reading the Shema 3.5,"Secular matters may be discussed in a latrine, even in Hebrew. -", The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 85) quotes <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> (994) which states that one should accustom oneself to act piously and not speak Hebrew at the latrine. The <i>Ramah (Orach Chayim</i> 3:2) mentions that it is preferable not to speak at all at the latrine.
Reading the Shema 3.5,"such as merciful, -"," רחום in Hebrew. The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and states that since this attribute is used as a name only in relation to God, it may not be uttered in the latrine. Rabbenu Yonah quotes <a href=""/16333#v4"">Psalms 112:4</a> as a source that uses the term רחום in relation to a righteous person, thereby refuting the Ra'avad. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 85:2 accepts the Rambam's position."
Reading the Shema 3.5,"However, the specific names of the Almighty i.e., those which may not be erased. -"," In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>.) the Rambam gives a larger list than appears here and includes descriptive terms used to refer to God, e.g., the Great One, the Mighty One, and other names.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> expresses surprise at the exclusion of the term שלום. <i>Shabbat</i> 10b explicitly mentions it as forbidden to be uttered in the bathhouse - all the more so at the latrine - since it is specifically used as a name of God (<a href=""/15814#v24"">Judges 6:24)</a>. The <i>Magen Avraham (Orach Chayim</i> 95) also forbids the utterance of שלום in such places."
Reading the Shema 3.6,or in the presence of dog or pig excrement while skins are soaking in it -," Skins were frequently soaked in feces in the process of making them into leather.</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 25a quotes two <i>beraitot</i>. One prohibits the <i>Shema</i> to be read near the excrement of dogs and pigs, and the other prohibits <i>Kri'at</i> Shema in the presence of these excrements only when skins are soaking in them. Ravvah prefers the second source, and the Rambam decides halachah in accordance with Ravvah's position.</p>
<p>Rashi explains that the idea of soaking skins applies only to the excrement of dogs and pigs, since it is a common practice to soak skins in them, but not to human feces, which is not used for such a purpose."
Reading the Shema 3.6,This is also the case regarding human urine but not animal urine. -," I.e., the <i>Shema</i> may be recited next to it. The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and quotes the Jerusalem Talmud, which includes donkey urine as one of those items that prohibit <i>Kri'at</i> Shema. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Talmud on which the Rambam based his decision most probably mentioned donkey dung (as mentioned in the previous comment) and not donkey urine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:6 reflects the position of the Ra'avad.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Asher points out that the Rambam mentions animal urine alone as not being problematic, thereby indicating that animal dung (e.g., cow or horse excrement) would be problematic. Rabbenu Asher himself sees no room to prohibit animal dung, since it is never mentioned in the Talmud as problematic. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> holds that the Rambam's position is that animal dung is prohibited only if its smell causes discomfort, and that the extent of this discomfort is somewhat subjective. Therefore, the Rambam did not mention it explicitly.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:4 rules in accordance with this understanding of the Rambam. (This is not surprising, since the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> were both written by Rav Yosef Karo.)"
Reading the Shema 3.6,of grain cereal -," There are five types of grain cereal - wheat, barley, oats, spelt and rye (See <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 5:1)."
Reading the Shema 3.7,"One may not recite the <i>Shema</i> next to feces even if they are as dry as a shard. However, if they were so dry that if thrown away -"," <i>Berachot</i> 25a defines this as feces which when either: a) rolled, or b) thrown, they will not crumble. At such a time, they are regarded like a shard. The Rambam chooses the stricter of these two opinions - i.e., that if thrown it still retains its shape and is, therefore, forbidden (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Reading the Shema 3.7,one may recite the <i>Shema</i> facing them. -," However, if they still emit a foul odor, the <i>Shema</i> may not be recited next to them, as mentioned in Halachah 12 in regard to a foul smell emanating from a substance (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Reading the Shema 3.8,How far must a person distance himself from feces or urine in order to recite the <i>Shema</i>? Four cubits. -," This halachah is based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 22b). In modern measure, a cubit is 48 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 57.7 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>."
Reading the Shema 3.9,When does the above apply? -," i.e., that one must distance oneself four cubits from urine and feces."
Reading the Shema 3.9,higher or lower than he -," he is considered to be in a different place, (<i>Berachot</i> 25b) and..."
Reading the Shema 3.9,The above applies provided no foul smell reaches him. -," This is not mentioned in the <i>beraita</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 25a. However, immediately after the halachah regarding separations, the <i>beraita</i> then states that a foul smell emanating from a solid substance prohibits recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. Hence, the Rambam associates the two halachot.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions that, based on the Rambam's position, one should be careful not to recite the <i>Shema</i> or pray in a house with a foul odor, even if the odor is emanating from a different house. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:2 quotes this, but also mentions the positions of Rabbenu Yonah and Rabbenu Asher, that a separation is sufficient even if an odor remains.</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> suggests that it is best to be strict in such a case. However, he grants one leniency. Generally, one must distance oneself from an odor even if he himself cannot smell it. However, in this instance, a lack of smell would be enough to permit the reading of the <i>Shema</i>."
Reading the Shema 3.10,"A person who is separated from feces by a glass partition, may recite the <i>Shema</i> next to them even if he can still see them. -", <i>Berachot</i> 25b equates this with a case where the feces are covered.
Reading the Shema 3.11,If feces are found in a hole in the ground -, See <i>Berachot</i> 25b.
Reading the Shema 3.11,"However, his shoe may not touch the feces. -"," After stating the halachah that one may put one's shoe on top of the hole in the ground, <i>Berachot</i> 25b questions the law when excreta is stuck to a person's shoe, and leaves the question unresolved (תיקו). Accordingly, the more stringent opinion is followed.</p>
<p>The Rambam explains that this applies if there is any contact between the shoe and the feces. However, the Ra'avad maintains that this only applies when the feces are actually stuck to the shoe. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>.) 76:2 supports the Rambam's position."
Reading the Shema 3.11,"If there is a residue of feces on one's skin or one's hands are dirty from the washroom, if - because of the small quantity or its dryness - there is no foul odor -"," <i>Berachot</i> 25a states simply “if there are feces on one's skin.” The Rambam explains this as referring to a residue of feces - i.e., a stain, with no actual substance.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Asher explains that this applies when there is actual substance on the person's skin, but it is covered by his clothing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 76:4 reflects the understanding of Rabbenu Asher. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> favors the Rambam's position."
Reading the Shema 3.11,"However, if it is still in its place, -"," i.e., his anal opening"
Reading the Shema 3.11,Many <i>Geonim</i> taught that one is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> if one's hands are soiled -, The position of Rabbenu Chananel mentioned above.
Reading the Shema 3.12,[When the source of] a foul odor has substance -," e.g., feces are found on the ground and a foul odor is emanating from them (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 25a)."
Reading the Shema 3.12,provided the odor has subsided. -," Rabbenu Manoach points out that this halachah applies only in the case where the substance is to his side or behind him. However, if the substance is in front of him, we have already learned in Halachah 8 that he must distance himself until he can no longer see it."
Reading the Shema 3.12,If [the odor] is not emanating from an actual substance -," e.g., it is the result of someone passing gas - he - does not necessarily have to distance himself four cubits. Rather, he...</p>
<p>should distance himself until the odor ceases and [then] recite. - The Ra'avad also disagrees concerning this point and requires that one distance himself four cubits from the point at which the odor ceases. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>.) accepts the Ra'avad's position."
Reading the Shema 3.13,It is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> while facing moving excreta -," <i>Berachot</i> 25a mentions a difference of opinion between Ravvah and Abbaye about this case. Abbaye holds that one is permitted to recite the <i>Shema</i> next to moving excreta, while Ravvah forbids it.</p>
<p>[The Babylonian Talmud is so full of disagreements between these two Torah scholars that it is called the book of the arguments between Ravvah and Abbaye. Among all these arguments, the halachah reflects Abbaye's position only six times. Here, also, the halachah is in line with Ravvah's opinion.]"
Reading the Shema 3.14,A person who reaches an unclean place -," I.e., a place where there is a foul odor emanating from excreta or urine."
Reading the Shema 3.14,"Similarly, if one is reciting [the <i>Shema</i>] and passes gas, he should stop until the odor subsides -"," for this is an odor that does not emanate from a solid substance as first mentioned in Halachah 12. The Hebrew word באשה is based on <a href=""/16170#v20"">Joel 2:20</a>."
Reading the Shema 3.14,The same applies to one studying Torah. -, <i>Berachot</i> 25a equates the two.
Reading the Shema 3.15,A person is permitted to continue reciting the <i>Shema</i> if a doubt arises whether feces or urine is found in the house in which he is located -," Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 25a) explains that it is not a normal practice to leave such materials in a house. Therefore, we may assume that the house is clean."
Reading the Shema 3.16,"Just as it is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> where there are feces or urine until one distances himself from it, so, too, the <i>Shema</i> may not be recited in the presence of nakedness -"," The previous <i>halachot</i> in this chapter have dealt with the prohibition of reciting the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of unclean substances and foul odors. As mentioned, this is a Torah prohibition based on the verse (<a href=""/9987#v15"">Deuteronomy 23:15)</a>: ""And your camp must be holy.""</p>
<p>The succeeding words in that verse - ולא יראה בך ערות דבר - ""Let Him not see any nakedness among you"" serve as the basis for halachot that follow in this chapter. These halachot deal with the impropriety of reciting the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of human nakedness."
Reading the Shema 3.16,This applies also to a non-Jew -, See <i>Berachot</i> 25b. The <i>Torah Temimah</i> explains that this prohibition even applies regarding the nakedness of primitive peoples who carry on their daily affairs unclothed.
Reading the Shema 3.16,Even if a glass partition separates him from them - since he sees them - he must turn his face away in order to recite the <i>Shema</i>. -," <i>Berachot</i> 25b distinguishes between feces behind a glass partition, which is permitted (see Halachah 10) and nakedness, which is forbidden. Regarding feces, the Torah demands (<a href=""/9987#v14"">Deuteronomy 23:14)</a>: “And you shall cover your excrement,” and a glass partition fulfills this function. However, the prohibition regarding nakedness is one of sight: לא יראה בך (It shall not be seen among you), and one sees through glass perfectly."
Reading the Shema 3.16,"is regarded as <i>ervah</i>. Therefore one should not gaze at a woman, even his wife, -"," with whom he is familiar, how much more so other women"
Reading the Shema 3.17,"Just as one may not recite the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of another's nakedness, so, too, is he forbidden to do so when he himself is naked. -"," This is based on the concept that one's heart should not see his nakedness. This same principle is expressed in Chapter 2, Halachah 7."
Reading the Shema 3.17,"If his loins are covered with cloth, leather or sack, even though the rest of his body is exposed, -"," Though some of these portions of the body are normally covered, they are not considered as ""nakedness."" Hence..."
Reading the Shema 3.17,"If he is lying under his sheet but is otherwise naked, he should make a separation -", between his heart and his genitalia
Reading the Shema 3.18,"When two people are lying under one sheet, -", without clothing
Reading the Shema 3.18,unless the sheet also separates between them in a manner that prevents their bodies from touching -," <i>Berachot</i> 24a records a difference of opinion between Rav Yosef and Shmuel. Both agree (as the Rambam states later in this halachah) that when sleeping in the same bed with his wife, one need only turn his face away from her in order to recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, Shmuel is of the opinion that this same halachah applies even if he were sleeping with a person other than his wife, while Rav Yosef feels that this dispensation is only granted in regard to one's wife."
Reading the Shema 3.18,from the loins downward. -," in contrast, bodily contact above this point would not induce sexual thoughts.</p>
<p>The <i>Mishnah Berurah (Orach Chayim</i> 73:2) points out, regarding this halachah, that were one to separate himself from another with the sheet, he need not also turn his head away."
Reading the Shema 3.18,their bodies are like his own and he is not affected by them -," i.e., he is familiar with them and sexual thoughts are not likely to be aroused."
Reading the Shema 3.18,separate below his heart -, so that his heart will not see his own nakedness
Reading the Shema 3.19,"A boy, until 12 years and one day; a girl, until 11 years and one day. -"," Rashi explains that these are the ages when puberty begins, and from this time onward, the youths become physically attractive. However, this opinion does not place any conditions on that age. The Rambam continues and makes that age conditional..."
Reading the Shema 3.19,"i.e., developed breasts and pubic hair. -"," Based on <a href=""/16114#v7"">Ezekiel 16:7</a>, <i>Niddah</i> 6:1 mentions these as signs of a woman's physical maturity. See also <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 2.</p>
<p>From this time onwards, he may not recite the <i>Shema</i> unless he has first separated himself from them with the sheet - as mentioned in the first clause of the previous halachah."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,The text --," As mentioned in the introduction, the Rambam composed the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intention of providing our people with clear directives concerning the performance of all the mitzvot. Hence, he also includes in this work the text of all necessary prayers and legal documents."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,customarily recited...in the time of exile --," as stated in Halachot 8:3-5, there are certain differences between the text we recite and that recited when the Paschal sacrifice may be offered."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"In haste, we left Egypt --"," This statement, half in Hebrew and half in Aramaic, refers to <a href=""/9980#v3"">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>. This line is not included in the Haggadot of Rav Amram or Rav Saadia Gaon, nor is it found in most subsequent Haggadot."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,This year --," Our Haggadot (and that of Rav Amram Gaon) state השתא, ""now."" However, Rav Saadia Gaon's Haggadah also uses the Hebrew הא שתא, ""this year."" However, unlike the Rambam, he employs that expression for both clauses."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"On all other nights, we are not required to dip even once --", Note the commentary on Halachah 8:2 regarding the order of the questions.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt --, <i>Pesachim</i> 115a mentions the beginning of this passage within the context of the discussion of the requirement to begin the description of the Exodus by telling of our people's roots. See also the commentary on Halachah 7:4.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"Once Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Tarfon --"," There is no explicit mention of this passage in the Talmud, although a somewhat parallel story is related in the <i>Tosefta, Pesachim</i>, Chapter 10."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,said to them --," This phrase is not mentioned in our text of the Haggadah. Its inclusion answers a question frequently raised: Why does the Haggadah mention this concept, which deals with the mitzvah to recall the Exodus from Egypt each day, on the Seder night? The recollection of the Exodus at the Seder is of a different nature entirely.</p>
<p>However, this addition clarifies the issue: This was one of the subjects discussed by the Sages in Bnei Brak."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,who has given the Torah to Israel; blessed be He --," Our text of the Haggadah employs a slightly different version, mentioning four expressions of blessing to parallel the four sons."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"that God, our Lord, has commanded you --"," Both the aforementioned sources state ""has commanded us,"" preventing comparison between the wise and wicked sons. Nevertheless, the Rambam (as well as Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon) found it more appropriate to quote the verse from the Torah verbatim."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,dessert --," The literal meaning of the Greek word <i>afikoman</i>--see the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <b>Pesachim</b> 10:8."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,The simple son --," the Jerusalem Talmud uses the expression: ""the foolish son."""
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"""it is because of this."" --"," The word זה (this) is always used to refer to a clearly visible entity, as <i>Menachot</i> 29a comments on <a href=""/9873#v2"">Exodus 12:2</a>. Similarly, in this context, ""this"" refers to a situation where symbols of the Exodus, the matzah and the maror, are visibly present before us."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,Blessed be He Who keeps His promise to Israel --," This passage is found in the Haggadot of Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon. However, its origins are unknown."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"""An Aramean sought to destroy my father..."" --"," This and the verses that follow are part of the וידוי ביכורים recited when the Jews would bring their first fruits to Jerusalem. <i>Pesachim</i> 116a requires the person reciting the Haggadah to ""expound from 'An Aramean sought to destroy my father' until he completes the entire passage."" This implies that the exegesis of the verses found in the Haggadah was already extant at that time.</p>
<p>The commentaries quote the <i>Sifri</i> as the source for these interpretations though our text of the <i>Sifri</i> contains only portions of this passage. [The passage is found in the <i>Mechiltah d'Rashbi</i> in its entirety. However, some authorities maintain that it was a later addition.] Nevertheless, other early collections of Midrashim, such as <i>Lekach Tov, Midrash HaGadol,</i> and the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, include the complete text."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"""I will pass through... and I will slay... I will execute... I, God."" --"," Our text of the Haggadah contains a further elaboration of this verse, showing how each use of the word ""I"" is intended to exclude God's use of an intermediary to execute judgement."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,Rabban Gamliel would say --," This passage and the remaining passages until the blessing, <i>asher ge'alanu</i>, are explicitly mentioned in the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a,b. (See also Halachot 7:5, 8:4 and the commentary, which mentions the change in the order there.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,In every generation --," This passage is found in <b>Pesachim</b> 116b. However, in contrast to the Talmud and our text of the Haggadah, the Rambam's text omits quoting <a href=""/9874#v8"">Exodus 13:8</a>: ""And you shall tell your son..."" Apparently, the Rambam had a different text of the Mishnah, which omitted this verse. This difference in texts is also the source for the Rambam's statements, Halachah 7:6: ""In every generation, a person is obligated to present himself..."" See the commentary on that halachah."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"Therefore, we are obliged to thank, praise, laud, glorify, exalt, magnify, adore, and give eternal praise --"," With slight textual differences, this entire passage is found in <i>Pesachim</i> 116b. (See also Halachah 8:5)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who redeemed us and redeemed our ancestors... --", This blessing is quoted from <i>Pesachim</i> 116b. The first portion was also recited while the Temple was standing.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,other festivals --," The word ""other"" can also imply ""of a different nature""--i.e., we pray for the Messianic redemption, when our festivals will be of an entirely different nature."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,and of the Paschal offerings --," The <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was not sacrificed when Pesach began on Saturday night. Accordingly, it is our custom to reverse the order of these sacrifices on such an occasion. However, the Rambam does not mention such a practice."
Blessings 5.1,Women and slaves -, whose Torah obligations are equivalent (<i>Chagigah</i> 4a)
Blessings 5.1,"There is a doubt whether their obligation stems from the Torah, since [this is a positive mitzvah] that is not linked to a specific time -"," Women are not obligated to fulfill such mitzvot. See <i>Kiddushin</i> (1:7). Since the obligation to recite grace is constant, whether one eats during the day or at night, it would appear that women are obligated. Some commentaries point to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 19) and the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 3:3 and <i>Kiddushin</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) as indications that the Rambam supports the view that a woman's obligation for grace stems from the Torah."
Blessings 5.1,Therefore -," i.e., because of this doubt"
Blessings 5.1,fulfill the obligation of grace on behalf of others. -," Since, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 11, a person can only recite a blessing on behalf of another person if he shares an equal obligation himself."
Blessings 5.1,"however, are obligated to recite grace -"," This expression appears to indicate that the Sages placed the obligation on the child himself. See also <i>Hilchot Sukkah</i> 6:1 and <i>Hilchot Lulav</i> 7:19, where the Rambam uses similar expressions. (In <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:13 and <i>Hilchot Chagigah</i> 2:3, however, the Rambam states that the obligation to train a child to fulfill these mitzvot lies on the father.)</p>
<p>The hypothesis that the obligation lies on the child is supported by Halachah 16, which states that a child may fulfill the obligation of grace for a person who did not eat to the point of satisfaction (and, therefore, is obligated to recite grace only by Rabbinic decree). Were the Sages to have placed the obligation to educate the child on his father and not on the child himself, the child would not be able to fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of another person.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is possible to explain that the Sages placed the obligation on the father. This obligation, however, encompasses the child and, hence, causes him to be considered as obligated in the mitzvah (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 17)."
Blessings 5.7,"Women, servants, and -", very young
Blessings 5.7,"They may, however, make a zimmun among themselves. Nevertheless, for the sake of modesty -"," If any two of these three categories of people eat together, there is a possibility of undesirable results. In order not to encourage such meals, the Sages did not impose the obligation of <i>zimmun</i>.</p>
<p>The Rambam mentions modesty only as a reason why women and servants should not join in a <i>zimmun</i>. Significantly, other authorities explain that it is for reasons of modesty that women should not be counted in a <i>zimmun</i> together with men."
Blessings 5.7,"Instead, women may make a zimmun alone -"," There is, however, no obligation for them to do so (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 199:7). Rabbenu Asher considers them as obligated to make a<i>zimmun</i>. Nevertheless, even among the Ashkenazic community, most authorities do not accept his ruling."
Blessings 5.7,An androgynous -, A person who possesses both male and female sexual organs
Blessings 5.7,A tumtum -," a person who has flesh covering his genitalia, making it impossible to determine whether he is a male or a female"
Blessings 5.7,A child -," The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 199:6 states that this applies to only one child, but not two or more."
Blessings 5.7,He may be counted among either a group of three -, to recite the <i>zimmun</i> together with two adult males
Blessings 5.7,for the purpose of zimmun. -," The <i>Magen Avraham</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, explains why such a decision is granted with regard to a <i>zimmun</i> and not with regard to <i>kaddish, barchu, kedushah</i>, and the like. The latter prayers are obligations incumbent on a person each day, and may be fulfilled only with a quorum of adult men. In contrast, since each person may fulfill his obligation to recite grace without a <i>zimmun</i>, leniencies were granted in counting the people included.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Asher and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 199:10) do not accept this distinction, and rule that a child may not be counted in a <i>zimun</i> until he is thirteen years of age and has exhibited signs of physical maturity."
Blessings 5.11,When three people who each came -," It is possible to explain that this is referring to three individuals who each began eating with a separate group in the same large room. Afterwards, they joined together and ate at the same table.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the halachah is speaking about three groups that ate on the same table, and one remained from each group (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>), or the three individuals came from different groups, but left their original group inadvertently or because of forces beyond their control (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:25)."
Blessings 5.11,"[join together], -"," even when they themselves do not eat together (<i>loc. cit.</i>). According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this applies when they eat together. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:5) states that, in either instance, the following law applies."
Blessings 5.11,If each of them already participated in a zimmun -," i.e., although they desired to continue eating, they responded to the<i>zimmun</i> and listened to the first blessing of grace (<i>Tosafot,</i> <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 200:1)"
Blessings 5.11,to participate in a zimmun again -," Even if the latter group of three eat together, since they did not begin their meal with the intention of eating as a company, they are not obligated to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>."
Blessings 5.11,"When three people sit down [together] to eat bread, they may not separate -"," even though one of the three desires to recite grace before the others, they must recite the <i>zimmun</i> as a group (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:28)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.1,In the days of Rabban Gamliel -," The commentaries question which Rabban Gamliel the Rambam refers to. <i>Seder Hadorot</i> points to Rabban Gamliel, the elder, grandson of Hillel the Elder, who lived in the first half of the first century of the Common Era. <i>Dorot Harishonim</i>, however, believes this to refer to the latter's grandson, who headed the Rabbinical court in Yavneh from 80 CE, after it was established there by Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai following the destruction of the Second Temple."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.1,They would oppress the Jews -, by slandering them to the Roman conquerors.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.2,"In each Shemoneh Esreh, -"," i.e., in all three prayer services"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.2,"However, if he is distracted and bothered, or unable to pray fluently, he should recite the first three [blessings] -"," The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 28b, states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Rabban Gamliel says that one should recite eighteen blessings each and every day (i.e., that each time he prays he should recite all eighteen blessings).<br/>
Rabbi Yehoshua says that one should recite the abbreviated version of the eighteen.<br/>
Rabbi Akiva says that if the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is fluent in his mouth he should recite all eighteen blessings; and if not, the abbreviated version of the eighteen blessings.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 110:1 states that in unusual circumstances, e.g., when travelling or when in a place where he would be distracted or interrupted, one may recite the shortened version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> adds that in normal circumstances, one is forbidden to recite this prayer. It is questionable if this is also the Rambam's intent or if he was more lenient and allowed such a prayer to be recited by a person who had difficulty concentrating even under ordinary conditions."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.3,And this is the blessing that they established as the abbreviated summary of the intermediate [blessings] -, This follows the opinion of Shmuel (<i>Berachot</i> 29a). Rav differs and maintains that one utters an abbreviated summary of each and every blessing.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.3,and circumcise our hearts to fear You. -," This corresponds to the blessing of ""Return us, our Father, to Your Torah."" The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God (<a href=""/16332#v10"">Psalms 111:10)</a> - i.e., our involvement in Torah is ultimately that which leads us to true fear of Heaven and <i>Teshuvah</i> (repentance)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.3,so that we will be redeemed -," This relates to the fourth blessing, גואל ישראל (the Redeemer of Israel)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.3,Cause us to prosper and to dwell in the pastures of Your land. -," This relates to ברכת השנים, the blessing for material wealth. It is interesting that this blessing also mentions specifically the idea of dwelling in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as the ultimate prosperity and blessing.</p>
<p>The Zohar explains that all blessing and bounty enters the world through <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and from there it is apportioned to the rest of the world. Jerusalem and the Holy Temple serve as the repositories for Divine grace and act as the meeting point between Heaven - the source of the bounty - and earth, the recipient of this blessing. Therefore, true prosperity, in both a material and spiritual sense, can only be achieved in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.3,Judge those led astray in accordance with Your knowledge -," This relates to the eighth intermediate blessing, ""Return our judges..."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.3,and let the righteous rejoice -," This relates to the tenth intermediate blessing, על הצדיקים (upon the righteous). In that blessing we ask God to grant a just reward to the righteous and pious. The text of this blessing also clarifies the Sages' appreciation of this reward - the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Temple - as expressed in the continuation of this section of the blessing."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.3,"in the flourishing of the might of David, Your servant, and in the clear, shining light of the son of Yishai, Your anointed one. -"," This relates to the twelfth blessing, called the blessing of the Messiah, the descendant of David."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.4,When does the above apply? In the summer. -," Only then, may one recite the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> mentioned in the above two halachot."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.4,"since he must mention ""the petition"" -", for dew and rain that is included...
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.5,On Sabbaths and holidays -, These are days of joy and thanksgiving when pleading and supplication are not appropriate. We are content with the world as it is and focus on its completeness.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.5,"of that particular day: the first three, the last three -"," i.e., These six blessings are recited without change in all of the <i>Amidah</i> prayers as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 9."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.5,"On Sabbaths, one concludes the intermediate blessing with ""who sanctifies the Sabbath."" -"," since after the creation of the world, God ""blessed the seventh day and made it holy"" (<a href=""/8166#v3"">Genesis 2:3)</a>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.5,"he concludes with ""who sanctifies Israel and the appointed times."" -"," As opposed to the conclusion of the blessing on Sabbath, the blessing of the holidays first mentions the sanctification of Israel and then of the specific time. The sanctification of the holidays is determined by the Jewish people since the exact date of each festival is based on the establishment of Rosh Chodesh (the first day of the month) of that particular month.</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 2:10, the Rambam explains that we are obligated to rely on the day established Rosh Chodesh by the Jewish court. This matter was handed over to them completely. God, who commanded the observance of the holiday, commanded us to rely on them.</p>
<p>This concept is based on the verse in <a href=""/9924#v4"">Leviticus 23:4</a>: ""These are the appointed days of God, sacred days, that you shall designate them in their appointed time."" The word אתם, <i>otam</i>, translated as “them,” may, with a different pronunciation mark be read as <i>otam</i>, “you,” indicating that “you,” the court on the earthly plane, is responsible for the establishment of the times of the festivals based on their designation of the day of Rosh Chodesh.<br/>
Therefore, we first mention God's sanctification of Israel and then Israel's subsequent sanctification of the holidays."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.6,When does this -," i.e., the previously stated halachah that one recites seven blessings on Rosh Hashanah"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.6,"However, in the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer on Rosh Hashanah, one recites nine blessings: the first three and the last three [recited] every day, -", for these are constants in all prayer services.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.6,The first of the intermediate blessings -, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 32a explains that the blessing which mentions the sanctity of the Rosh HaShanah holiday and its sacrifices is also included in <i>Malchuyot</i>.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.6,the second with Zichronot [acknowledgement of God's remembrance of the Jewish people] -, <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:9 emphasizes how one should mention only those remembrances which are of a positive nature.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.7,"On Yom Kippur, one recites seven blessings -", See <i>Yoma</i> 87b and <i>Niddah</i> 8b.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.7,"the first three and the last three blessings, -", recited in every <i>Amidah</i> prayer.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.8,When does the above apply? On the Fast Day -," i.e., Yom Kippur, the only day when the Torah requires fasting"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.8,one recites a <i>Musaf</i> Prayer of nine blessings like the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer of Rosh Hashanah. -, See Halachah 6.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.9,"Before the first blessing of each and every prayer, one states: ""God, open my lips, and my mouth will utter Your praise"" [<a href=""/16272#v17"">Psalms 51:17</a>]. -"," See <i>Berachot</i> 4b which quotes Rabbi Yochanan as requiring this verse to be recited before every prayer.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Yonah explains that this verse must be understood in conjunction with the verse that follows it: ""You do not desire that I offer sacrifices; a burnt offering, You do not want:"" (<a href=""/16272#v18"">Psalms 51:18)</a>. After his relations with Bathsheva, King David realized that he could not attain forgiveness by offering a sacrifice, since a sacrifice is accepted only after an act done unwittingly. Therefore, he asked that God assist him in finding the proper means of expression through prayer to achieve atonement.</p>
<p>We, too, are in a similar situation for we have no Temple and our prayers were instituted in the place of our sacrifices. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 5.) Accordingly, we ask God to assist us in our desire to utter His praises, and request our needs in such a way that it will be desirable to Him.</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 4b raises a question regarding the recitation of this verse before <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Rabbi Yochanan himself states that one who starts the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> immediately after the blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, גאל ישראל (Who redeemed Israel) is called a person of the World to Come. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 18, where the Rambam mentions this halachah.)</p>
<p>Why is the recitation of this verse not considered an interruption between the blessing and the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>? The Talmud answers that this verse is considered as an integral part of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and thus, is viewed as a ""long prayer."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.9,"""May the utterances of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be in accordance with Your will, O God, my Rock and Redeemer"" [<a href=""/16240#v15"">Psalms 19:15</a>] -"," This verse is particularly apt for recitation after the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Proper intention during the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is a very difficult matter (See Chapter 4, Halachah 15). Therefore, at the end of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> we ask God to heed our words in any case:</p>
<p>""May the utterances of my mouth..."" - meaning to say: May the words which I uttered in the midst of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> be accepted by You even if my intention was not complete and my mouth acted independently of my heart and mind. ""... and the meditations of my heart...""; i.e., those lofty thoughts and desires which burn in my heart, but I cannot express, may they also be heard by You and received favorably."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.10,On Rosh Chodesh and the intermediate days of a festival -," i.e., those days between the first Yom Tov (two days in the diaspora) and last Yom Tov on Pesach and Sukkot. They are called Chol Hamo'ed, the ""mundane"" days of the festivals - i.e., those days which are simultaneously part of the festival, but also days on which most work is allowed. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 530-548 for the laws of Chol Hamo'ed.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.10,"In the Avodah, -"," This is the first of the last three blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, which expresses our desire for the return of the service (<i>avodah</i>) of the Temple."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.10,"""Our God and God of our fathers, let our remembrance rise and come,..."" -"," This is added in the <i>Avodah</i> blessing before the statement ""And let our eyes see Your return to Zion in mercy. Blessed are You...""</p>
<p>The source for this addition is <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states that on Chol HaMo'ed and Rosh Chodesh we should ask God to remember us favorably and to bless us with mercy and lovingkindness on this special day of sanctity. Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a) explains that we should request mercy for Israel and Jerusalem in order to restore the daily sacrifices to the Temple.</p>
<p>The laws pertaining to a person who omitted this addition in his prayers are mentioned in Chapter 10, Halachot 10-11.</p>
<p>In the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer of the intermediate day of a festival, one recites the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer of the holiday itself. - I.e., the service is essentially the same with only minor changes in the text of the blessings."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.10,"one recites seven blessings; the first three and last three, -", blessings that are recited in every <i>Amidah</i>
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.11,"and adds: ""Our God and God of our fathers, let our remembrance rise and come..."" in the Avodah. -", as is done in the weekly service.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.11,one -," recites seven blessings, the first and last three which are always recited and the middle blessing appropriate to the unique nature of the day. One..."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.11,"He concludes [the blessing] on Rosh Chodesh with: ""who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and Roshei Chodashim;"" -", following the logic mentioned in halachah 5 that the sanctity of the Sabbath is mentioned first for it is not dependent on the Jews' consecration of the months.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.12,"On a holiday that occurs on the first day of the week, -"," i.e., it occurs immediately after the the Sabbath."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.12,one inserts into the fourth blessing -," i.e., the middle blessing of the seven recited on a holiday."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.12,"""And You have made known to us Your righteous statutes and have taught us to perform the decrees of Your will. And You have given us, God, our Lord, the sanctity of the Sabbath -"," <i>Berachot</i> 33b. The Talmud discusses the exact placement of the <i>Havdalah</i> paragraph in the context of a three-sided disagreement on the issue in the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 33a).</p>
<p>There are slight differences between the text quoted by the Rambam and the text found in most contemporary siddurim. In his Order of Prayers for the entire year found at the conclusion of <i>Sefer Ahavah</i>, the Rambam also mentions a slightly different text. See also <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:28."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.12,and the rejoicing of the pilgrim feast. -,This refers to the special sacrifices brought on the holidays.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.12,"And You have set apart and sanctified Your people Israel with Your holiness. You have given us, O God, our Lord, festivals for joy, holidays and appointed times for gladness, etc. -"," Joy and gladness are especially relevant to the holidays, as it is written: ""And you shall rejoice in your holidays...and you shall be only joyous"" (<a href=""/9980#v14"">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>-15). The Rambam discusses the halachot based on these verses in <i>Hilchot Shivitat Yom Tom</i> 6:17-18."

<p><i>14Berachot</i> 33a states that without knowledge and understanding a person cannot comprehend these distinctions in time. Accordingly, the <i>Havdalah</i> prayer is recited in the blessing recognizing God as the source of our gift of thought."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.13,"On Chanukah and Purim, one adds ""For the miracles,..."" -"," Both Chanukah and Purim are commemorated with the same basic prayer, על הניסים. This prayer begins with a statement of thanks for the miracles and redemption relevant to these days, and then a paragraph describing the events of the holiday is recited.</p>
<p><i>Shabbat</i> 24a, which discusses the laws of Chanukah, is the source for this prayer. However, this Talmudic passage mentions only Chanukah, and not Purim. However, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi quotes a <i>Tosefta</i> from <i>Berachot</i> which equates Chanukah and Purim.</p>
<p><i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quotes Rav Amram Gaon that על הניסים is not recited at night on Purim because we have not yet read <i>Megillat Esther</i>. This position is not accepted. It is, however, interesting that a difference was made, according to Rav Amram, between the על הנסים of Chanukah and that of Purim."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.14,"On Fast Days, -"," This includes the communal fast days (the third of Tishre, the tenth of Tevet, the thirteenth of Adar, the seventeenth of Tammuz, and the ninth of Av) and those fast days proclaimed in response to a specific time of trouble, such as a lack of rain. (See Chapter 1 of <i>Ta'anit</i>.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.14,"adds ""Answer us..."" -"," <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b refers to the prayer of fast days. Rashi explains that this is <i>aneinu</i> (Answer us...), a prayer of supplication asking God to look down upon us with favor and not hide His countenance from us because of our wrongdoing."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.14,"The leader of the congregation recites it as an independent blessing between ""the One who redeems Israel"" and ""the One who heals...,"" and concludes with ""the One who answers in times of trouble."" Thus, he recites 20 blessings. -"," This is based on the passage from <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b quoted above. A clear distinction is made between the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> uttered by all the congregants and the repetition recited aloud by the שליח ציבור (leader of the congregation). The שליח ציבור does establish for himself, as representative of the community as a whole, an independent blessing relevant to the fast day. Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.</p>
<p>There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the שליח ציבור to recite עננו in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3). (See the <i>Bi'ur Halacha</i> who holds that at least ten people must intend to fast in order for the שליח ציבור to recite עננו.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.14,"one adds [the following] to the blessing of ""the One who rebuilds Jerusalem"" -"," i.e., the eleventh intermediate blessing of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. It is appropriate that the addition regarding the ninth of Av be placed in this blessing, which speaks of rebuilding Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Despite this logic, there is some question regarding the inclusion of this prayer in this blessing. The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the עבודה (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the הודאה (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in הודאה, while prayers regarding the future are placed in עבודה.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in בונה ירושלים (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of שומע תפילה (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of בונה ירושלים. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.15,"During the rainy season, [the phrase] ""the One who causes the rain to fall"" -"," This is not the full text of the addition. We praise G‑d as ""the One who causes the wind to blow and the rain to fall"" (משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 114:1)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.15,"In the summer, [one adds] ""the One who causes the dew to descend"" -"," This represents one of the differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazic practice. Sephardic tradition, following the Rambam and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 114), obligates the utterance of מוריד הטל in the summer. In contrast, the Ramah, (ibid., 114:3) explains that the custom of the Ashkenazim is not to utter 18לטהáדירומ<i>.<br/></i></p>
<p><i>The 14Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 114:3) explains the latter position based on <i>Ta'anit</i> 3a, which states that the Sages did not obligate one to mention the winds or dew for they are never lacking. Nevertheless, if one desires to mention them, he may. Ashkenazim do include משיב הרוח in the winter, because of the mention of the rains which are necessary. Sephardim and the Nusach Sephard recited by Chassidim do mention טל in the summertime."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.18,"Throughout the entire year, one concludes the third blessing with ""the Holy God"" and the eleventh blessing with ""the King who loves righteousness and justice."" -"," In his responsum (97), the Rambam teaches that one need mention ""the King"" only during the Ten Days of Repentance, but that during the rest of the year, ""the One who loves righteousness and justice"" is sufficient."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.19,There are places that are accustomed during these ten days to add in the first blessing -," i.e., the ten days from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, inclusive. The source for this halachah is <i>Soferim</i> 19:8. There it states the following:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Just as the <i>chatimot</i> [of the blessings] of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are different from those of other holidays, so too, the prayers [of these days] themselves differ.<br/>
One does not make any special mention of remembrances in the first three or last three [blessings], except on the holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur themselves alone. And even on these days, they allowed it only with difficulty.</p>
<p>The """"remembrances"" referred to in the Mishnah are the very additions mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah. It is clear from the Mishnah that they are to be mentioned only on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and not on any of the intermediate days. However, the general practice is to add these special prayers on all ten days. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 602.)</p>
<p>The difficulty regarding these additions stems from <i>Berachot</i> 34a which states that one may not add any special requests in the first three or last three blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. (See Chapter 6, Halachah 3.) However, Rabbi Yitzchak ibn Gayut explains that since these remembrances are relevant to the needs of the entire community, they may be recited in the first three and last three blessings. <i>Berachot</i> (ibid.) prohibits only requests made by an individual for his personal needs."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.19,"and in the second one: ""Who is like You, Merciful Father,..."" -"," Who is like You, Merciful Father, who remembers His creations for life with mercy."" This is placed before the end of this blessing 18תויחהלáהתאáןמאנו םיתמ."

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.1,as the idolaters and their priests do -," <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 251) explains that this is a particularly severe prohibition, since its violation involves making a sign for idolatry on our own bodies."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.1,"One is liable for each corner. Therefore, a person who shaves both his temples - even if he were to do so simultaneously and had received only a single warning - is [liable for] two measures of lashes. -"," In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that although this prohibition involves two different activities (shaving the right corner and shaving the left corner), it is not considered to be two mitzvot, because the Torah's expression forbidding such shaving includes both sides in the same phrase. Had the Torah mentioned both the right and left sides, it would be considered to be two mitzvot.</p>
<p>[This prohibition applies equally to] one who shaves off only the corners of his head and leaves the remainder of his hair - As mentioned in Chapter 11, Halachah 1, this style of cutting hair is referred to as a <i>blorit</i> and was practiced by the gentiles."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.1,"Since he has shaved the corners, he is [liable for] lashes. -"," From this, we see that the mitzvah is not dependent on the rationale mentioned above.</p>

Since women are obligated by the prohibition against working on the Sabbath, they are also obligated by the positive commandment of sanctifying its holiness (<i>Berachot</i> 20b).</p>
<p>The restriction of this mitzvah to the Sabbath follows the opinion of the <i>Lechem Mishnah</i>, who maintains that the sanctification of the festivals is a Rabbinic injunction. There are, however, other opinions, which consider the mitzvah as applying to the festivals as well."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.3,eating and offering the Paschal sacrifice -," <i>Pesachim</i> 91b explains that the Torah uses the expression (<a href=""/9873#v4"">Exodus 12:4)</a>: ""According to the number of souls [in a household]... individuals should be designated for the lamb,"" to include women in the observance of this mitzvah."

<p>One may remove the [hairs from] the corners [of our heads] with scissors. - In one of his responsa, the Rambam writes that he would trim the corners of his head. He explains that - in contrast to the law applying to a Nazarite's hair - there is no positive commandment to allow this hair to grow and no need to do so. In many Jewish communities, however, it is customary to allow this hair to grow. Since its removal involves the violation of a Torah prohibition, they consider the growth of this hair as a sign of Jewish identity."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.7,It is customary for pagan priests to remove their beards. -," Note our commentary on Halachah 1. In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 44), the Rambam notes that even in his time, it was customary for Christian monks to shave their faces."

There, ""anyone who fears heaven should fulfill all the opinions and not shave any portion of his beard with a razor."""
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.7,A person who removes them all at the same time is [liable for] five measures of lashes. -," Nevertheless, as explained in the commentary on Halachah 1, the prohibition is considered to be a single mitzvah, and not five.</p>
<p>One is liable only when one shaves with a razor, as [implied by <a href=""/9920#v27"">Leviticus 19:27</a>]: ""Do not destroy the corners of your beard."" [We can infer that this applies only] to shaving which utterly destroys [one's facial hair]. Therefore, a person who removes his beard with scissors is exempt. - From the Rambam's expression, it appears that the removal of facial hair with scissors is forbidden. One is not, however, punished for such an act (<i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, <i>ibid.</i>; <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>). The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 181) differs, and maintains that it is permitted to remove one's facial hair as long as one does not use a razor.</p>
<p>In addition, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> and <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> explain that by mentioning the fact that gentile priests remove their facial hair, the Rambam implies that removing such hair violates the prohibition of following ""the paths of the gentiles."" (See Chapter 11, Halachah 1.) In the context of this prohibition, the means used to remove the facial hair are of no consequence.</p>
<p>Other authorities (Rashba, Vol. IV, Responsum 90; <i>Shibbolei Leket</i>; <i>Tzemach Tzedek, Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 93) forbid the removal of one's facial hair within the context of the prohibition against a man's adorning himself in the same manner as a woman. (See Halachot 9 and 10.) In this context as well, it makes no difference how one removes the hair.</p>
<p>Many contemporary authorities have explained that in addition to all these points, growing a beard has been accepted as a sign that a person is God-fearing and precise in his observance of the mitzvot. Accordingly, anyone who desires to be viewed as such should not remove his beard even if he does not use a razor.</p>
<p>A person who allows himself to be shaved is not [liable for] lashes unless he provides assistance. - Note our commentary on Halachah 1."

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.9,"and women to remove such hair, one is not given stripes. It is permitted -"," The expression, ""one is not given stripes,"" and the contrasting statement, ""It is permitted,"" lead to the conclusion that, even in these communities, it is forbidden for men to remove this hair. The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 182:1) differs, and grants permission for men to remove such hair in these communities.</p>
<p>When there are medical reasons requiring the removal of such hair, even the more stringent views allow it to be shaved off (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 182:4)."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.10,A woman should not adorn herself as a man does -," <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 39) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 542) consider this prohibition to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. Curiously, with regard to this and the following prohibition, the Rambam departs from his usual custom and does not mention the Biblical proof-text, <a href=""/9986#v5"">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>, for these prohibitions.</p>
<p>e.g., she may not place a turban or a hat on her head - Needless to say, a hat that was styled for women is permitted. As the Rambam states later in the halachah, everything depends on local custom."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.10,or the like. She may not cut [the hair of] her head as men do -," i.e., a woman's coiffure may not resemble a man's. The Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> read יגלה, ""reveal,"" instead of יגלח, ""cut."" According to that version, the Rambam is saying that when a woman goes out without covering her head, in addition to violating the basic laws of modesty (see <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:11-12; <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:17), she is also transgressing this Torah prohibition."

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.10,he should be lashed -," for violating this prohibition. The Ra'avad (see also <i>Sho'el UMeshiv</i>, Vol. I, Responsum 210) differs, and maintains that such an act violates only a Rabbinic prohibition.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.10,"Similarly, if he dyes his hair dark, he is given lashes after dyeing a single hair. -", The prohibition applies only when one attempts to look younger. Dyeing one's hair grey is not forbidden (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 182:7).
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.10,"may not wrap their heads [in a veil] as women do, or cut [the hair of] their head as men do. -"," As the Rambam states in that halachah, ""the stringencies of both a man and a woman are applied to them.""

<p>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) explains that the prohibition against writing on one's flesh applies only when the imprint left by the ink or dye is permanent. If it is removable, it is not forbidden. In this manner, he justifies the acts of people who jot down notes on their flesh when they have no paper available."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.12,A person who gouges himself for the dead -," The prohibition applies only when a person makes such gouges as a sign of bereavement over the dead. Even when he gouges himself as an expression of grief for other matters, he is not liable, as stated in Halachah 16. Nevertheless, as stated in the following halachah, one is also liable for gashing or gouging oneself for idols."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.12,This [prohibition] applies both to priests and to Israelites. -," Though <a href=""/9922#v5"">Leviticus 21:5</a> specifically forbids the priests from expressing their grief in this manner, that injunction is not considered to be a separate commandment.

<p>A person who makes a single gouge for five dead people -<i>Makkot</i> 20b and the <i>Sifra</i> derive this concept through the exegesis of the verse from Leviticus cited above.

<p>[The difference between the two is that if one gouges himself in grief over] the dead, whether he did so with his bare hands or with an instrument, he is [liable for] lashes; - Since the verse from Deuteronomy also concludes ""for the dead,"" it appears that both gashing and gouging are forbidden essentially as mourning rites.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.14,This commandment also includes [a prohibition] -," In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 45), the Rambam explains that the interpretation which follows is an allegory, and the simple meaning of the verse is to prohibit gashing oneself in grief. Nevertheless, it is significant that the Rambam includes this ""allegory"" in a text which is, as he states in his introduction, ""halachot, halachot."" Thus, he emphasizes how important unity is to the Jewish people.</p>
<p>There is an important halachic dimension to the Rambam's explanation in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. One of the principles of Torah law is that punishment is never administered for the violation of a לאו שבכללות (""a prohibition which includes within it several different injunctions;"" see <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3).

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.1,"In the morning, <i>Musaf</i>, and Ne'ilah services -"," In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 26), the Rambam writes that the mitzvah is for the priests to bless the people ""every day."" The Sages extended the scope of the requirement and obligated the priests to bless the people in all the above services (<i>Ta'anit</i> 26b).</p>
<p>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:44) writes:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">It is customary in these countries to recite the priestly blessing only on holidays, when people are in festive and joyous spirits...<br/>
In contrast, on other days - even on Sabbaths - [the priests] are disturbed, worrying about earning a livelihood and the delay of work.<br/>
Even on holidays, the priestly blessing is recited only in the <i>Musaf</i> service, directly before the people leave the synagogue and rejoice in the holiday festivities.</p>
<p>The Ramah's decision is based on the view that the priestly blessings must be recited with feelings of joy and goodwill, and if those feelings cannot be aroused (see <i>Zohar</i> III 147a), it is proper that the blessing not be recited. Though the Ashkenazic community follows his view, in Egypt and in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> the priests have always fulfilled the mitzvah of blessing the people every day. Many Ashkenazic authorities, among them Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi and Rav Shlomo Kluger, desired to introduce this practice in the Ashkenazic community.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.2,"Therefore, the priestly blessing is recited during it. -"," Similarly, in Ashkenazic communities, when the priests do not recite the priestly blessings every day, the <i>chazan</i> should recite the blessing in his repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.6,is that the priests should not ascend to the duchan wearing sandals. -," This decree was instituted lest the sandal strap of one of the priests snap and he descend to fix it. Someone watching them might think that he was forced to descend because someone exposed a blemish in his lineage that prevented him from serving as a priest (<i>Sotah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.7,"When the priests bless the people, they should not look at them -", individually. A priest must concentrate his thoughts on blessing the people. Looking at any individual (or group) face to face might cause him to divert his thoughts from that intent.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.7,"Rather, their eyes should be directed towards the earth like one standing in prayer. -"," See Chapter 5, Halachah 4.</p>
<p>The <i>Levush</i> develops this concept, explaining that implicit in the priests' recitation of the blessing is the prayer that God will truly bless the people."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.7,"Rather, all the people should listen attentively to the blessing -"," Hence, while the priests are reciting the blessing, the people should not recite any Biblical verses or prayers (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i> 128:25).

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.9,How is the priestly blessing recited in the Temple? The priests ascend to the duchan -," This is a slightly problematic statement. The Mishnah (<i>Middot</i> 2:6) and the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:3) describe the <i>duchan</i> as three steps separating the Courtyard of the Israelites from the Priestly Courtyard. There, the Levites would stand and accompany the Temple service with songs and music. No mention is made of the priests standing there. Also, in Halachah 14, the Rambam mentions that the priests would bless the people while standing on the steps of the Temple building.</p>
<p>The Radbaz (Vol. II, <i>Leshonot HaRambam</i>) offers a resolution to this difficulty, noting that priests with disqualifying physical deformities may not stand on the Temple steps (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:20). Thus, the majority of priests would stand on the Temple steps, and those with deformities would stand on the <i>duchan</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> (<i>Middot</i> 2:4) states that most of the priests would stand on the Temple steps. If there was no room there, they would stand on the <i>duchan</i>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.9,They lift their hands above their heads -," as an act of deference to the <i>Shechinah</i>, which rests between their fingers (Rashi, <i>Sotah</i> 38a). Note the contrast to the practice outside the Temple, as described in Halachah 3."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.9,except the High Priest. He does not lift his hands above the tzitz. -," The <i>tzitz</i> refers to the golden plate worn by the High Priest on his forehead on which God's name is written (<a href=""/9889#v37"">Exodus 28:37)</a>. Accordingly, it is not proper for the High Priest to lift his hands above it (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>)."

Circumcision 2.1,The optimum manner of performing the mitzvah is to use an iron utensil -," The <i>Targum Yonatan</i> interprets <a href=""/15789#v2"">Joshua 5:2</a> as an indication that iron was used for circumcision even at that early age. The <i>Prishah</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 284:7) relates that this custom was instituted after Goliath's iron helmet split open before David's stone. God promised iron that, in recognition of its act on behalf of the Jews, they would use it for a positive purpose in future generations. The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:1) refers to the use of iron utensils for circumcision as an accepted custom."
Circumcision 2.2,How is the circumcision performed? The foreskin that covers the crown of the penis is cut off until the entire crown is revealed. -," i.e., all the tissue of the foreskin until its ridge must be removed."

Circumcision 2.6,return and remove the tzitzim that disqualify the circumcision even though one has interrupted one's activity -," This is permitted because, until these strands of flesh are removed, the obligation to circumcise the child on the eighth day has not been fulfilled. (See Halachah 3 and commentary.) Hence, just as we are allowed to carry out the operation on the Sabbath at the outset, we are allowed to complete its performance by removing these strands of flesh."
Circumcision 2.6,and bandage the circumcision afterwards. -," In general, medication may be applied on the Sabbath only when a danger to life is involved. The Sages considered circumcision to be in this category."
Circumcision 2.6,"What is implied? If we are unable to find a knife, a knife may not be made on the Sabbath, nor may we bring it from place to place. -"," i.e., from a public domain to a private domain"
Circumcision 2.6,"Although the [mitzvah of] eruv is only Rabbinic in origin, it is not superseded by [the necessity] to bring a knife -","<i>Pesachim</i> 92a cites this as an example of the power of Rabbinic law.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 10.2",A proper Torah scroll is treated with great sanctity and honor. -, This general principle is the foundation for the remaining halachot in this chapter.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 10.2",[This prohibition applies] even if he possesses many scrolls or if he [desires to] sell an old scroll in order to purchase a new one. -," Rabbenu Manoach explains that the reason for the latter ruling is that, despite one's resolve, circumstances may arise, and ultimately, one may never buy the new scroll. Accordingly, if the new scroll has already been completed and an agreement concluded, the old scroll may be sold. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 270:3, however, forbids a sale even under these circumstances. (Compare to <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 11:12.)"
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 10.2",a) to use the proceeds to study Torah; -," for Torah study leads to the performance of mitzvot. This is the purpose of a person's life (<i>Megillah</i>, ibid.)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 10.6","A person should not enter a bathhhouse, lavatory, -"," since it is unbecoming to bring a Torah scroll into such places. (See also Chapter 7, Halachah 3.)"
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 10.6",even if it is covered by a mantle and placed in its container. -," As explained in the previous and the following halachot, a Torah scroll that is covered by its usual containers is considered as if it is openly revealed."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 10.6",or from the lavatory. -," See Chapter 4, Halachah 17; <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:8.</p>
<p>There are certain versions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> that state: ""until he moves four cubits away from the corpse, bathhouse, or lavatory."" Since the Rambam does not mention the obligation of moving away from a bathhouse in Chapter 4 or in Chapter 3 of <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i>, we can assume that he does not feel that it is necessary, and that as soon as one steps outside of the bathhouse he may recite words of Torah."
Reading the Shema 2.1,"One who recites the first verse of Kri'at Shema - i.e., Shema Yisrael... -"," <i>Berachot</i> 13b mentions several opinions concerning which sections of the <i>Shema</i> require intention. This is dependent on the discussion (See commentary, Halachah 2) regarding the extent of the obligation to read <i>Shema</i> required by the Torah. Rabbi Meir understands intention to be absolutely necessary only for the first verse and this opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 60:5."
Reading the Shema 2.1,does not fulfill his obligation. -, and must therefore recite the <i>Shema</i> again.
Reading the Shema 2.1,Even a person studying Torah in his usual way -," i.e., even were he studying these three sections of the Torah."
Reading the Shema 2.2,A person may recite [the Shema] as he is -," This is based on Hillel's interpretation of the verse ""...and when you walk on the way"" (<a href=""/9970#v7"">Deuteronomy 6:7)</a>. (See the commentary on Chapter 1 Halachah 1 for further elucidation.)"
Reading the Shema 2.2,or riding an animal -, <i>Kiddushin</i> 33b equates riding on the back of an animal with walking.
Reading the Shema 2.2,"However, one may recite it lying on his side -"," He should be completely on his side, since <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) also forbids reciting the <i>Shema</i> while turned slightly over onto one's side, unless extraordinary circumstances prevail, as explained by the Rambam in this halachah."
Reading the Shema 2.3,A person who is walking on foot must stop for the first verse -," in order to concentrate his attention.</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 13b mentions two opinions regarding the extent of the <i>Shema</i> one must recite before he may continue on his way:<br/>
that of Rav Yehudah which requires the first two verses of the <i>Shema</i> to be recited standing;<br/>
and that of Rabbi Yochanan which requires the entire <i>Shema</i> to be recited in a stationary position.</p>
<p>Rav Yitzchak Alfasi explains that the actual halachah does not follow either of these positions, but rather is in accordance with the view of Rabbi Meir that only the first verse requires absolute intention. (See Halachah 1.)</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 63:3 also accepts this decision."
Reading the Shema 2.3,"If one is sleeping, we should disturb him by awakening him until he reads the first verse. -"," <i>Berachot, op. cit.,</i> explains that one unavoidably overcome by sleep after having recited the first verse has fulfilled his obligation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the majority of the <i>Rishonim</i> hold that this is the case on the condition that he nevertheless manages to recite the rest of the <i>Shema</i>, albeit in a drowsy state.</p>
<p>Thus, our halachah mentions the necessity of alertness for the first verse within the context of the halachot of the intention required to read the <i>Shema</i>. In Halachah 12, the Rambam discusses sleepiness within the context of the need for proper enunciation of the words of the <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. That halachah supports the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> position that one fulfills one's obligation only if he also recites the rest of the <i>Shema</i>."
Reading the Shema 2.4,A person who is involved in work must stop while he recites the whole first section -," Rav Yitzchak Alfasi explains that this applies even according to the halachically accepted position of Rabbi Meir, that utmost concentration is necessary for the first verse only. (See the commentary on Halachah 1.)</p>
<p>The obligation to have proper concentration and the necessity that one's recitation of the <i>Shema</i> not appear haphazard are two different halachic requirements."
Reading the Shema 2.4,"must also interrupt their work for the first section, in order that their recitation should not be haphazard. -"," i.e., a casual matter, regarded lightly. See the commentary to Halachah 8."
Reading the Shema 2.4,"Even one standing in a tree or on top of a wall may read [the Shema] where he is, -"," Despite the obvious difficulties this poses regarding his ability to concentrate, the Rambam allows a worker to remain in the tree or on the wall and recite the <i>Shema</i>.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach holds that only the workers may remain in the tree. In contrast, a foreman who is there to encourage his work force, must descend from the tree and recite it on the ground. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 63:8 both disagree with this and allow both of them to recite it while in the tree."
Reading the Shema 2.5,A person who is studying Torah when the time to recite the Shema arrives should stop to recite the Shema -," <i>Shabbat</i> 9b, 11a states that a person should interrupt his Torah study for <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but not for the Amidah prayers. This refers even to Sages like Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who would never interrupt their Torah study except to perform mitzvot which could not be performed by others. The acceptance of the yoke of God's kingship in the <i>Shema</i> is fundamentally necessary even for a person with such an all encompassing commitment to Torah.</p>
<p>Similarly, as stated above, <i>Berachot</i> 10b states that the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> at its proper time is preferable to the study of Torah."
Reading the Shema 2.5,One who is involved in community matters should not stop -," The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) equates involvement in community matters to the study of Torah, in terms of granting an exemption from prayer. The <i>Tosefta</i>, (<i>Berachot</i> 1:4) relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Rabbi Yehudah says: Once I was following Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. The time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> arrived (but they did not perform the mitzvah). I was under the impression that they felt unable to. They were, however, involved in community matters.</p>
<p>(See also <i>Tosefta Berachot</i> 2:6.)"
Reading the Shema 2.6,"A person who is eating, is in the bathhouse, is having a haircut, is working with skins -"," The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) prohibits one to start eating, have a haircut, work skins, etc., close to the time of the afternoon prayer. However, the Mishnah adds that were one to start doing one of these prohibited actions, he need not stop. The Rambam also applies these principles to <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). The Ra'avad (based on <i>Sukkah</i> 38a) differs and holds that a person must interrupt his meal in order to read the <i>Shema</i>."
Reading the Shema 2.6,should complete [his task] and recite the Shema afterwards. If he fears that the time for its recitation -," There is a question whether the Rambam refers to 6 minutes before sunrise, the optimum time to recite the <i>Shema</i>, or the end of the third hour of the day beyond which one does not fulfill the mitzvah (See Chapter 1, Halachah 11-13). According to other authorities, the latter view would be followed."
Reading the Shema 2.7,"A person who immerses in a ritual bath and is able to come up and dress before sunrise, should do so, and [then] recite [the Shema]. -", This is based on the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 22b.
Reading the Shema 2.7,"before he can recite the Shema, -"," i.e., before he can dress himself and recite the <i>Shema</i>."
Reading the Shema 2.7,He should not cover himself with putrid water that has an unpleasant odor -," <i>Berachot</i> 24b equates one who recites the <i>Shema</i> in a place with an unpleasant odor to one who has profaned the word of God. One who stops reciting in such a place is praised, and <a href=""/9996#v47"">Deuteronomy 32:47</a> says about him ""... in those words, your days will be lengthened"". Chapter 3 deals with many halachot regarding the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> in unclean surroundings."
Reading the Shema 2.7,or with water so clean that his nakedness is visible. -," Chapter 3, Halachot 16 and 17, explain how it is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of ""nakedness."""
Reading the Shema 2.8,"While reciting the Shema, a person should not gesture with his eyes or lips, or point with his fingers -"," <i>Yoma</i> 19b distinguishes between the first section of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and the second in this regard, forbidding these activities only during the recitation of the first section. Indeed, in Halachah 4 which also deals with a ""haphazard"" recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, the Rambam, himself makes such a distinction.</p>
<p>Indeed, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam relies on his statements in Halachah 4. Rabbenu Manoach explains that the Rambam did not clarify the matter explicitly lest he cheapen the value of the second section in the eyes of his reader. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that although making such gestures in the second section is not as ""improper"" as during the first, doing so is, nevertheless, prohibited."
Reading the Shema 2.8,"If one were to do this, although he does fulfill his obligation, he has acted improperly. -"," <i>Yoma</i> ( <i>op. cit.</i>) refers to <a href=""/15974#v22"">Isaiah 43:22</a>: ""And you have not called upon Me, Jacob,"" implying that such a casual reading of the <i>Shema</i> is not considered as calling to God.</p>
<p>The Maharsha explains an added implication of the above verse. Rashi, in his commentary to <a href=""/8241#v29"">Genesis 46:29</a>, relates that when Jacob was first reunited with Joseph he made no response because he was reciting the <i>Shema</i> at that time. Surely, one who gestures while reading the <i>Shema</i> has certainly not achieved the level of devotion."
Reading the Shema 2.8,"[However, even] if he does not do this, he fulfills his obligation. -"," The entire latter portion of this halachah is based on <i>Berachot</i> 15a:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">One who recites the <i>Shema</i> so that the words are not audible to himself has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yosse says that he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he reads, but does not enunciate clearly: Rabbi Yosse says that he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yehudah says that he has not.</p>
<p>The Talmud concludes (<i>ibid.</i> 15b) that the halachah is in accordance with the lenient position in both cases - i.e., the anonymous opinion in the first case and Rabbi Yosse in the second.</p>
<p>Rav Yitzchak Alfasi adds that this is only after the fact. A priori (לכתחילה), one must read in such a way as to be audible to himself and enunciate the letters clearly. The Rambam follows this view.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one must at least mouth the words of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, even if he does not pronounce them loudly enough that they are audible to himself. Thought is not regarded like speech. (See the commentary on Halachah 3.) Therefore, one who does not even move his lips, but just thinks about the words as he ""reads"" them, does not fulfill his obligation (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 62:3)."
Reading the Shema 2.9,as if there were no dagesh -," e.g., were one to say <i>vedivarta vam</i> instead of the proper pronunciation, <i>vedibarta bam</i> (<a href=""/9970#v7"">Deuteronomy 6:7)</a>."
Reading the Shema 2.9,Nor should one pronounce the silent sheva -," e.g., to say <i>bechol levavecha</i> instead of <i>bechol levavcha</i>."
Reading the Shema 2.9,one must pause between two words in which the first word ends with the same letter with which the second word begins. -, lest the two be heard as a single word.
Reading the Shema 2.9,"[One should act] similarly in the cases of (<i>avadtem meheirah</i>) (<a href=""/9975#v17"">Deuteronomy 11:17)</a> and (<i>hacanaf p'til</i>) (<a href=""/9943#v38"">Numbers 15:38)</a>. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 15b mentions even more cases of problematic words. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:20 quotes all the examples found in the Talmud. There are other cases in <i>Kri'at Shema</i> where this problem arises, such as <i>veahavta et</i> (<a href=""/9970#v5"">Deuteronomy 6:5)</a>. In all these cases care must be exercised to separate the words clearly.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the Rambam mentions one example from each of the three sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, in order to teach us that enunciation is equally important in all the sections."
Reading the Shema 2.9,"One should sufficiently elongate the dalet in <i>echad</i> (<a href=""/9970#v4"">Deuteronomy 6:4)</a> in order to proclaim God's sovereignty over the Heavens and the Earth and all four directions. The chet in <i>echad</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) should not be shortened -"," <i>Berachot</i> 13b relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Sumkos says: Anyone who lengthens the pronunciation of <i>echad</i>, his days and years are lengthened.<br/>
Rav Acha bar Ya'akov understands that to refer to the <i>dalet</i> [of <i>Echad</i>]. Rav Ashi says that this is on condition that he not shorten the <i>chet</i>.<br/>
Rav Yirmiah was sitting before Rav Chiyyah bar Abba and noticed that he severely lengthened [his <i>dalet</i>]. He said to him that once he had proclaimed God, King above and below and to the four directions of the Heavens, he need not continue [to prolong the <i>dalet</i>].</p>
<p>The Maharsha mentions that the <i>chet</i> (numerical value of eight) corresponds to the Earth and the seven levels of Heaven, and the <i>dalet</i> (numerical value of four) corresponds to the four directions."
Reading the Shema 2.10,A person may recite the Shema in any language he understands. -," <i>Berachot</i> 13a records a disagreement between Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi, who holds that the <i>Shema</i> must be read as it is - i.e., in <i>lashon hakodesh</i> - and the Sages, who hold that it may be recited in any language. The latter explain that the word <i>Shema</i> - literally, ""hear,"" - indicates the acceptability of any language that one hears - i.e., understands."
Reading the Shema 2.11,One who reads [the Shema] out of order does not fulfill his obligation. This refers to the order of the verses. -," The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 15a) states that one who recites the <i>Shema</i> out of order does not fulfill his obligation. The Rambam understands this to refer only to placing verse 2 before verse 1, but not to placing section 2 before section 1, as he states in the continuation of this halacha."
Reading the Shema 2.11,even though it is not permitted -, for the order established by our Sages should be followed
Reading the Shema 2.11,"that he does fulfill his obligation, since these sections are not sequential in the Torah. -"," i.e., the sections do not appear in the <i>Shema</i> in the same order as they are in the Torah itself."
Reading the Shema 2.12,"If one reads intermittently, -"," i.e., he recites part of the <i>Shema</i> and then stops, and then continues reciting, and stops again, etc."
Reading the Shema 2.12,This refers to the one who recites it in order. -, as required by the previous halachah.
Reading the Shema 2.13,One who is unsure whether or not he recited the Shema -," <i>Berachot</i> 21a records a disagreement between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Yehudah says that one who is doubtful regarding whether or not he recited the <i>Shema</i> need not read it again, since <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is a Rabbinical ordinance and we follow the rule a doubt in a Rabbinical ordinance leads to a lenient response.</p>
<p>Rabbi Elazar says that he must recite the <i>Shema</i> in such a situation of doubt because <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is a Torah obligation. Therefore, the principle - ספק דאורייתא לחומרא [a doubt regarding a Torah Law leads to a strict response] - should be followed.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher also follow Rabbi Elazar's opinion."
Reading the Shema 2.13,"However, if he is sure that he recited the Shema but is in doubt regarding whether he recited the blessings before and after it, he need not recite the blessings again. -"," Since he has definitely fulfilled the Torah obligation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, we invoke the aforementioned rule of לקולא ספק דרבנן with regard to the blessings, which alone are of Rabbinic origin. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 8:12.)"
Reading the Shema 2.13,should return to the point of his mistake. -," and then continue to read in order, from that verse until the end of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, in accordance with Halachah 11 in this chapter. See <i>Tosefta, Berachot</i> 2:4."
Reading the Shema 2.14,"A person who errs in the middle of a section, but is unaware of where he paused -", See the commentary on the previous halachah which discusses this expression.
Reading the Shema 2.14,One who recited (uch'tavtam) -," This halachah is found in the continuation of <i>Berachot</i> 16a, quoted above."
Reading the Shema 2.14,"or of [the section of] <i>ViHayah Im Shamoa</i>, (And if you will listen), -"," i.e., the second section of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, which begins with these words."
Reading the Shema 2.15,[The following rules apply when] one encounters other people or is approached by them while reciting the Shema. -," Having discussed in the previous halachot the proper reaction to unintentional interruptions in <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, the Rambam now discusses when one must purposefully interrupt his reading of the <i>Shema</i> in order to greet people or respond to their greetings.</p>
<p>These halachot are based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 13a):</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">""Between sections, one may initiate greetings out of respect, and respond. In the middle [of a section], one may initiate greetings out of fear, and respond,"" these are the words of Rabbi Meir.<br/>
Rabbi Yehudah says: ""In the middle [of a section] one may initiate contact out of respect, and respond out of fear. Between sections, one may initiate out of respect and respond to anyone's greeting."""
Reading the Shema 2.15,he should stop and greet those he is obligated to honor -," i.e., he may initiate the contact. This follows Rabbi Yehudah's position in the Mishnah quoted above."
Reading the Shema 2.15,his teacher -," i.e., one who taught him Torah. <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 5:1 states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Just as a person is commanded to honor his father and fear him, so too, is he obligated to honor and fear his teacher. Indeed, his teacher deserves more than his father. His father brought him into the life of this world, while his teacher... brings him to the life of the world to come."
Reading the Shema 2.16,"and initiate an exchange of greetings only with someone of whom he is afraid - e.g., a king or tyrant. -"," The term מפני היראה (out of fear) used in the abovementioned Mishnah refers to a king or tyrant - i.e., someone of whom one is physically afraid.</p>
<p>Rashi explains fear as referring to someone who one is afraid will kill him. Rabbenu Asher takes issue with Rashi's explanation of fear. He points out that it is unnecessary for the Mishnah to inform us that in the case of פיקוח נפש (a life-threatening situation), one may interrupt <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. Even violation of the Shabbat is permitted in such instances.</p>
<p>Therefore, Rabbenu Asher explains ""out of fear"" as referring to one's father or rabbi: איש את אימו ואת אביו תיראו (Every person must revere his mother and father) (<a href=""/9920#v3"">Leviticus 19:3)</a>. We also learn in <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 4:12 and <i>Pesachim</i> 108a that the fear of one's rabbi is similar to the fear of Heaven. See also <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 5:1.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 66:1 accepts Rashi's position regarding honor and Rabbenu Asher's interpretation of fear. He also mentions the Rambam's understanding of ""out of fear,"" as referring to a king or tyrant - this refers to one who is likely to cause pain or sorrow (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Reading the Shema 2.17,"These are the intervals between the sections: between the first blessing and the second; between the second [blessing] and ""Shema"" -"," This decision is based on the principle that the blessings before the <i>Shema</i> - though necessary to develop the meditative consciousness necessary for the correct intention during <i>Shema</i> - are not considered as directly related to the <i>Shema</i> itself.</p>
<p>Accordingly, though it is forbidden to make an interruption between the recitation of a blessing before a mitzvah and the actual fulfillment of the mitzvah, these interruptions are permitted between the blessings before the <i>Shema</i> and the <i>Shema</i>. Some communities maintain that the blessings before the <i>Shema</i> are similar to the blessings before other mitzvot and do not allow such interruptions."
Reading the Shema 2.17,"However, the interval between the end of the third section of Kri'at Shema and [the paragraph beginning with] Emet v'yatziv is considered the middle of a section, - <i>Berachot</i> 14b explains the significance of the proximity of the end of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, א-להיכם אני ה', to the word <i>Emet</i>. This is based on a verse in <a href=""/16007#v10"">Jeremiah 10:10</a> א-להיכם אמת ‘ה and proclaims that ""God, your Lord, is true."" Thus, these words do not represent a break between sections, but rather a continuum.",
Reading the Shema 4.1,Women -," <i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">A woman's exemption from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is obvious. It is a time-oriented commandment [i.e., the <i>Shema</i> must be recited at specific times and is thus classified as ""time-oriented"" (see Chapter 1, Halachot 9 to 13)], and women are exempt from all such commandments.<br/>
What might I have thought? That since [<i>Kri'at Shema</i>] contains the acceptance of the sovereignty of Heaven [even women would be called upon to recite it.<br/>
It [i.e., the Mishnah] teaches that this is not so and that women are indeed exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.</p>
<p>In terms of actual halachic ruling, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:1 rules that although women have no obligation, even rabbinic, to recite the <i>Shema</i>, it is proper that they do so in order to accept upon themselves the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven.</p>
<p>Women are also exempt from the blessings before <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but are obligated to recite the blessings after it, because there is a mention of the Exodus from Egypt, which women are also obligated to remember and mention (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 70:1).</p>
<p>The <i>Aruch Hashulchan</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 70:1) also mentions that women may recite all the blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and adds that the women of his area (Russia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century) were accustomed to do so, and that they should be blessed for their meritorious actions.</p>
<p>The responsa, <i>Yabia Omer</i> (2:6), states that women of Sephardic origin are not accustomed to recite the blessings. However, <i>Kaf HaChayim</i> rules that they may.</p>
<p>slaves - This refers to Canaanite slaves who have been sold to a Jewish owner and are obligated by all the commandments that women are obligated to perform. A halachic comparison between the two is found in <i>Chaggigah</i> 4a and <i>Kiddushin</i> 23a.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Talmud quotes a separate source for the exemption of slaves: ""Hear O Israel, God our Lord, God is One"" (<a href=""/9970#v4"">Deuteronomy 6:4)</a>. He who has no master other than the Almighty [is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>], thus exempting the slave, who has another master.</p>
<p><i>Chaggigah</i> 4a also derives the halachah in a similar fashion, albeit from a different verse."
Reading the Shema 4.1,We should teach children to recite it at the proper time -," The latter point represents a difference in opinion between Rashi and the Rambam. The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 20a, states that children are free from the obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i>. Rashi states that they are entirely free of obligation even according to Rabbinic law because their parents may not be available at the specific times at which the <i>Shema</i> must be recited.</p>
<p>The Rambam and Rabbenu Tam differ and maintain that the mishnah is only referring to the obligations according to Torah law, but according to Rabbinic decree they are obligated. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:2 rules in accordance with the Rambam and Rabbenu Tam."
Reading the Shema 4.1,One who is preoccupied and in an anxious state regarding a religious duty -," <i>Berachot</i> 16b differentiates between a bridegroom, who is exempt because of his involvement in a mitzvah, and one whose ship is sinking in the sea. Though the latter individual is also anxious, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, because his preoccupation is not with regard to a commandment."
Reading the Shema 4.1,including Kri'at Shema. -," I.e., even though it contains an acceptance of the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven, he is still exempt.</p>
<p>The phrase, <a href=""/9970#v7"">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, ובשבתך בביתך (and while you are sitting in your house) implies that the obligation is only incumbent on someone who is involved in his own personal affairs - ""your house."" Thus, it excludes one who is involved in the performance of a mitzvah (<i>Berachot</i> 11a and 16a)."
Reading the Shema 4.1,because he is distracted lest he not find her a virgin. -," as explained above. Rabbenu Manoach writes in the name of the Ra'avad that the bridegroom is exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> only if he is able to have relations with his wife. However, if she is menstruating or sick, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach also discusses the different views regarding the bridegroom's obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> during the day if he does not engage in relations the first night. He concludes that he should be obligated since ""the Jews are a holy people and the bridegroom will be able to divert his thoughts from his wife and concentrate on reciting the <i>Shema</i>."""
Reading the Shema 4.2,"However, one who marries a woman who is not a virgin is obligated to recite the Shema, -", on his wedding night
Reading the Shema 4.2,it is not so distracting. -, for there is no question of the woman's virginity.
Reading the Shema 4.3,One who is bereaved of a relative for whom he is obligated to mourn -," <i>Leviticus</i> 21:2-3 mentions the six relatives for whom a person is obligated to mourn: a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, a sister. The Rabbis also added the obligation to mourn for one's wife or husband. See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 2:1."
Reading the Shema 4.3,until he has buried him -," The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 17b, states that one who has his dead one ""lying in front of him"" is exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Talmud (<i>ibid.</i> 18a) explains that any relative waiting to be buried is considered to be ""lying in front of him."" This is derived from Abraham's characterization of Sarah as being in front of him (<a href=""/8218#v4"">Genesis 23:4)</a>, even though her body was not physically present."
Reading the Shema 4.3,A person who is watching the body -," I.e., guarding the body from an animal or other damage. (See <i>Berachot</i> 18a.)"
Reading the Shema 4.3,"When there are two watchers, one should continue watching while the other withdraws and recites the Shema. [When the latter] returns, the other should depart and recite [the Shema]. -"," As opposed to the actual mourners, the guards are obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i> if they are able to. Their exemption is not based on their distracted condition, but on their involvement in the commandment. Therefore, if another is able to guard the body for a few moments, the guard must recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, if there is no one to relieve the guard, he is not allowed to recite the <i>Shema</i> (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> on the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 71:3).</p>
<p>The watchers must remove themselves in order not to recite the <i>Shema</i> within 6 feet of the dead person. (See Chapter 3, Halachah 2 and commentary.)"
Reading the Shema 4.4,A body should not be taken out for burial close to the time for reciting the Shema -," Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 19a, explains that doing so will prevent many people from reciting the <i>Shema</i>."
Reading the Shema 4.4,"If they do begin to remove the deceased and the time for reciting the Shema arrives while they are accompanying the body, -", to the burial
Reading the Shema 4.4,or after it -," I.e., they have already carried it. It is customary for several people to carry the coffin, in order to involve themselves in the mitzvah."
Reading the Shema 4.5,Should they be involved in eulogies when the time for Kri'at Shema arrives -, See <i>Berachot</i> 19a.
Reading the Shema 4.5,"singly and recite, -"," but not all at once, because this is lacking in respect for the deceased."
Reading the Shema 4.5,"If the deceased is not present, all the people should recite the Shema -"," I.e., there is then no problem of embarrassing the dead by performing commandments."
Reading the Shema 4.6,"After the burial, when the mourners return to receive condolences and the people follow them from the gravesite to the place where they form a line to receive condolences. -"," The people form a שורה - a line (or lines) around the mourners. Afterwards, they offer their condolences one by one, as they pass before the mourners (<i>Hilchot Aivel</i> 13:1,2). Others interpret the שורה as two lines facing each other. The mourners then walk between these two lines, and as they pass, the people offer their condolences.</p>
<p>The people are generally accustomed to say: May God comfort you among the other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem."
Reading the Shema 4.6,"they should do so. If not, they should not start -"," the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.</p>
<p>The above is conditional upon there being enough time afterwards to recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, if the third hour is passing, the <i>Shema</i> should be recited immediately (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). The Ramah quotes this halachah in <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 72:4. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that one is allowed to recite the <i>Shema</i> before comforting the mourners, because he has not yet begun performing the mitzvah of comforting them."
Reading the Shema 4.7,"Anyone who has an exemption from Kri'at Shema but nevertheless desires to be strict with himself and recite, may do so. -"," The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 16b) records a difference of opinion whether a bridegroom may recite the <i>Shema</i> on the first night or not.</p>
<p>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel states: ""Not everyone who wants to take the name may take it,"" (i.e., not everyone may pronounce God's name whenever he pleases). The Sages differ and allow the <i>Shema's</i> recitation."
Reading the Shema 4.8,All those ritually impure are obligated to read the Shema and recite the blessings before and after it in their impure state. -, The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 26a) mentions a difference of opinion concerning this issue and the Rambam accepts the more lenient view.
Reading the Shema 4.8,that day -, before the time for the <i>Shema</i> passes. It is not necessary to make that effort and the person may recite the <i>Shema</i> in an impure state.
Reading the Shema 4.8,a menstrual woman -," <a href=""/9916#v19"">Leviticus 15:19</a> states that not only a menstrual women, but anyone or anything she touches contracts ritual impurity."
Reading the Shema 4.8,"or the couch on which these people have laid, -"," See <a href=""/9916#v10"">Leviticus 15:10</a> which explains that even that which is sat upon by someone impure, may not be touched."
Reading the Shema 4.8,Ezra and his colleagues decreed that a man who had a seminal emission -," <a href=""/9916#v16"">Leviticus 15:16</a> deems such a person as ritually impure. However, as above, that would not effect his ability to read the <i>Shema</i>."
Reading the Shema 4.8,"Thus, they separated him from the other ritually impure -", who were not prevented from reading the <i>Shema</i>.
Reading the Shema 4.8,This ordinance was not universally accepted among the Jewish people. Most were unable to observe it -," See also <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4-6 and commentary.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that though there is no need to immerse oneself in a mikveh, it is necessary to wash for it is forbidden to recite words of Torah with any traces of semen on his body. See Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 76:4."
Reading the Shema 4.8,The Jewish people accepted the custom of reading the Torah -," <i>Berachot</i> 22a relates that one of Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira's students was mumbling his words. When asked by Rabbi Yehudah to explain his behavior, he stated that he not been able to immerse himself after having a seminal emission. Rabbi Yehudah told him to speak up without embarrassment for the words of Torah cannot contract ritual impurity."
Reading the Shema 4.8,"Rather, they stand in their state of purity forever, as [<a href=""/16020#v29"">Jeremiah 23:29</a>] states: ""Are not my words like fire, declares the Lord."" -"," Thus, the differentiation made above has its basis, not on human logic, but on Divine decree. <a href=""/9987#v13"">Deuteronomy 23:13</a> teaches: ""And your camp shall be holy,"" forbidding the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of physical filth. In contrast, the verse from Jeremiah quoted above clearly implies the inability of ritual impurity to exert its influence over the words of Torah (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."
Human Dispositions 3.1,"A person might say, ""Since envy, desire, [the pursuit] of honor, and the like, are a wrong path and drive a person from the world, -"," With these statements, the Rambam obviously refers to the mishnah from <i>Avot</i> which he quoted at the conclusion of the previous chapter. Having decried the traits mentioned there, he explains that his condemnation is directed against excessive materialism, but not against all involvement in worldly affairs."
Human Dispositions 3.1,"For example, he will not eat meat, nor drink wine, nor live in a pleasant home, nor wear fine clothing, but, rather, [wear] sackcloth and coarse wool and the like -"," In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam makes a similar - but more lengthy - condemnation of asceticism. There he also mentions other ascetic practices - refraining from sleep and seeking solitude in the mountains and deserts."
Human Dispositions 3.1,"This, too, is a bad path and it is forbidden to walk upon it. -"," In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that, at certain times, many of the pious adopted ascetic practices as a safeguard against excessive involvement in materialism. However, they never regarded such practices as a goal in their own right. Others observed their behavior and mistook asceticism for an end rather than a means to achieve the middle path.</p>
<p>From the Rambam's statements in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, it would appear that there are two drawbacks to asceticism:<br/>
a) It might lead a person to poor health, illness, and a lack of strength which would prevent him from serving God as the Rambam states in Halachah 3.<br/>
b) A person might err and feel that he has fulfilled his obligation to serve God through these ascetic practices. As a result, he may never feel the need to dedicate himself to the service of God as He prescribed in the Torah.</p>
<p>There is a third disadvantage that is stressed heavily by the teachings of Kabbalah and Chassidut and may be hinted at by the Rambam's statements in the following halachot.</p>
<p>The <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 42b) states that God created the world ""in order to let Himself be known."" Similarly, <i>Tanya</i> (Chapter 33) explains that God created the world because He desired to have a dwelling place in the lower worlds. Thus, a person who tends to otherworldliness and asceticism, defeats God's purpose in creation."
Human Dispositions 3.1,Our sages declared: -," <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a. [Interestingly, the author of this statement, Rabbi Eliezer HaKfar, is also the author of the statement (<i>Avot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) that ""envy, desire, and the pursuit of honor, drive a person from the world.""]"
Human Dispositions 3.1,"Therefore, our Sages directed man to abstain only from those things which the Torah denies him and not to forbid himself permitted things by vows and oaths -"," One should not conclude that the Rambam completely disapproves of vows and oaths. At the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> (13:23), the Rambam states: ""Whoever takes a vow in order to stabilize his temperaments and correct his deeds, is zealous and praiseworthy.""</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, he gives examples of people who were excessively inclined to a particular quality who take vows to correct their faults (in a manner reminiscent of his advice in the beginning of Chapter 2 of these halachot). Rather, what the Rambam criticizes in our halachah is abstention for the sake of abstention."
Human Dispositions 3.1,"Thus, our Sages stated: -"," The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Nedarim</i> 9:1"
Human Dispositions 3.1,"They are not following a good path, [for] our Sages -", <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a
Human Dispositions 3.2,"A person should direct his heart and the totality of his behavior to one goal, -"," In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 5, the Rambam addresses himself to many of the concepts mentioned in this and the following halachah. He begins that chapter with the declaration:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">A person must control all the powers of his soul with [his] intellect... and concentrate on a single goal at all times: To comprehend God, blessed be He, to the extent that man can know Him.<br/>
All of his activities: what he does, the way he rests, and what he says should lead to this goal."
Human Dispositions 3.2,"The [way] he rests, rises, and speaks should all be directed to this end. -"," In the previous Halachah, the Rambam condemned asceticism and otherworldliness. In this Halachah, he stresses the desired intent of our worldly involvement, to know God.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, Halachah 6, the Rambam introduced a religious component into the development of an ethical personalty, pointing out that we must ""imitate"" God's qualities. In this halachah, he adds a further point. All of man's actions are to be taken in an atmosphere of God-awareness.</p>
<p>The concept of knowing God recalls the opening Halachah of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">The fundamental [principle] upon which all fundamental [principles are based] and the pillar of the wisdoms is to know that there is a Primary Being.</p>
<p>In both halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the knowledge of God is not an abstract, intellectual past-time, but rather an all- encompassing commitment, embracing every aspect of our experience. Torah living does not confine God to the synagogue or the house of study, but provides us with a means to relate to Him within every dimension of our lives (<i>Al HaTeshuvah</i>).</p>
<p>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. - i.e., he should not view the acquisition of money as an end in its own right."
Human Dispositions 3.2,"so that he will be able to obtain that which the body needs - food, drink, a home and a wife. -"," However, as the Rambam continues in the following Halachah, the maintenance of physical well-being is also not an end in its own right. Rather, it is also only a means for the service of God.</p>
<p>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also uses the expression ""solely for pleasure,"" indicating that the Rambam does not advocate a life without physical pleasure. (Note also the passage from the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, quoted below.)</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with enjoying food, for example, as long as one does so within the framework of maintaining health. Indeed, in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how one may use pleasure to encourage himself to perform the acts necessary to maintain his health."
Human Dispositions 3.2,"Therefore, he should not eat all that the palate desires like a dog or a donkey. -"," In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam states: ""In such an activity, a person is just like an animal. It is not an action man undertakes because he is a man, but rather, one that he undertakes because he is an animal."""
Human Dispositions 3.2,"For example: a person with a warm constitution should not eat meat or honey, nor drink wine - as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (<a href=""/16396#v27"">Proverbs 25:27)</a>. One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, -", this is given as a remedy for a warm liver constitution (Maimonides' Medical Aphorisms).
Human Dispositions 3.2,"Similarly, he should not have intercourse except to keep his body healthy -"," See Chapter 4, Halachah 19, for a discussion of this matter."
Human Dispositions 3.2,"Therefore, he should not engage in intercourse whenever he feels desire, -"," See also Chapter 5, Halachah 4, which discusses the frequency of intimate relations."
Human Dispositions 3.3,A person who accustoms himself to live by [the rules of] medicine does not follow a proper path if his sole intention is that his entire body and limbs be healthy -," The Rambam puts the maintenance of health mentioned in the previous halachah into proper perspective. It is not to be pursued as a goal in its own right. Rather, it should be appreciated as merely a means to enable one to reach an awareness of God. The Rambam develops this idea at length in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> Chapter 5. There, he states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">A person should have the intention while eating, drinking, having intercourse, sleeping, awakening, moving, and resting, [that he does so] for the purpose of his physical health alone.<br/>
His intention in [seeking] physical health should be to prepare for the soul healthy and sound vessels to acquire wisdom and intellectual and emotional advantages until he reaches the goal of [knowing God]."
Human Dispositions 3.3,"Rather, he should have the intent that his body be whole and strong, in order for his inner soul to be upright so that [it will be able] to know God. -"," The Rambam also elaborates on the interrelation between the attainment of physical health and spiritual achievement in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 27.</p>
<p>Heath is necessary as part of one's process of striving to know God..."
Human Dispositions 3.3,"[Similarly,] one should intend to have a son [with the hope that perhaps he will be a wise and great man in Israel. -"," This is the desired goal in procreation - to perpetuate the nation, not only physically, but also spiritually.</p>
<p>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam associates such behavior with <a href=""/9970#v5"">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>: ""Love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might."" The course of action described enables us to dedicate every aspect of our being toward the love of God as prescribed by this verse.</p>
<p>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He. - Perhaps, the Rambam uses this name for God to convey the concept that just as God's presence pervades all existence, our service of Him must encompass all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>On this matter, our Sages - <i>Avot</i> 2:15"
Human Dispositions 3.3,"This is what Solomon declared in his wisdom: ""Know Him in all your ways -"," <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> 17:7 also associates the above statement with this Biblical quote. <i>Berachot</i> 63b describes this verse as: ""A small passage upon which all the fundamentals of Torah depend."" Note also the Rambam's comments in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, <i>ibid.</i></p>
<p><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. III, notes that the rules of Torah scholarship would have called for the quotation of the Biblical verse before the quote from our Sages. However, the Rambam chooses this sequence because it reflects a progression in the service of God.</p>
<p>""All of your deeds should be for the Sake of Heaven"" implies that the deeds are not themselves holy, merely that they are directed toward a Godly intent. ""Know Him in all your ways"" implies that a bond with God can be established within the context of our physical activity itself."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.1",It is a positive commandment from the Torah -, <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 170) and <i>Sefer Hachinuch</i> (Mitzvah 405) count this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.1","on Rosh HaShanah, as [<a href=""/9957#v1"">Numbers 29:1</a>] states: ""It shall be a day of sounding [the ram's horn] for you."" -"," Though the ram's horn is not explicitly mentioned in the verse, our Sages derived the requirement as the Rambam explains."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.1",is a bent -,"Rams' horns are always bent. This, too, has homiletic significance, referring to the bending over of our proud hearts. (See <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26b.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.1",All shofarot other than that of a ram are unacceptable. -," The Rambam's opinion is based on the statement of Rav Levi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b), who declares: ""The mitzvah of Rosh Hashanah is to be performed with bent [shofarot],"" implying the use of a sheep's or ram's horn for that is their natural shape.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad, Rabbenu Asher, and many other Rishonim maintain that Rav Levi desired to designate the type of shofar which is most preferable to use, but did not intend to disqualify the horns of other animals. Their view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:1), which states that it is desirable to use the horn of a ram. However, if that is not possible, the horn of any animal may be used. The only exceptions are the horns of a cow and some wild animals whose horns are single, solid entities (Ramban)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.1","is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah [it was derived by our Sages in the following manner]. Concerning the yovel, [<a href=""/9926#v9"">Leviticus 25:9</a>] states: ""You shall make a proclamation, sounding the shofar...you shall proclaim with the shofar."" The oral tradition -", <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.2",In the Temple -," As will be explained in the commentary to Chapter 2, Halachah 8, and Chapter 7, Halachah 13, in certain contexts the Rambam interprets the expression במקדש - literally, ""in the holy place"" - as referring to the entire city of Jerusalem. (See also the Rambam's commentary to the mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 4:1.) However, in the present context, it refers to the Temple alone. Thus, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 27a states that the shofar was sounded in this manner only ""on the Temple Mount and at the eastern gate."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.2",The sounding of the shofar was extended -, for greater emphasis
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.2","Why were the trumpets sounded together with it? Because [<a href=""/16319#v6"">Psalms 98:6</a>] states: ""You shall sound trumpets and the voice of the shofar before God, the King."" -"," <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a states that the expression ""before God"" implies: in the Temple."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3","At the outset, we should not blow a shofar of idol worship. -", For it is not appropriate to use such a shofar for a mitzvah.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3","[In contrast,] should one sound a shofar belonging to an apostate city, - עיר הנדחת. <a href=""/9977#v13"">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>-19 describes the laws governing a city in which the majority of the inhabitants have turned to idol worship. All the idolaters must be slain and all the homes and property burned. No benefit may be derived from them. (See also"," <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>, Chapter 4.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3",Concerning a stolen shofar - one who blows it fulfills his obligation -," Though in general, a mitzvah performed with a stolen article is not acceptable (see Chapter 8, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:7), this case is an exception..."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3",even though the listener does not touch [the shofar] -," Based on this statement, the commentaries propose that, according to the Rambam, a person who blows a shofar without putting his lips to it fulfills his obligation. The Ramban (see <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> 1:6) does not accept this view."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3",The laws of theft do not apply to sound alone -," for sound is not a physical entity that can be possessed. Rabbenu Manoach and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite other examples from <i>Nedarim</i> 13b-15a, where the Sages differentiate between sound and material entities.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1) derives this law as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone agrees that a stolen lulav is unacceptable. What is the difference between a shofar and a lulav?</p>
<p>Rabbi Yosse responded: ""Concerning a lulav, [<a href=""/9924#v40"">Leviticus 23:40</a>] states: 'You shall take for yourself,' implying that only 'your own' is acceptable. In contrast, [<a href=""/9957#v1"">Numbers 29:1</a>] states: 'It shall be a day of blowing for you,' implying that regardless [of the nature of the shofar used, the blowing shall be 'for you']"".</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer explained: ""There, [concerning the lulav,] one must perform the mitzvah with the lulav itself. Here, [concerning the shofar,] one performs the mitzvah with its sound.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, because a sin is associated with this mitzvah, Ashkenazic custom is that no blessing should be recited before blowing such a shofar (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 586:4)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3","olah offering should not be sounded, -"," Once an animal is consecrated as an <i>olah</i> offering, no part of its body may be used any other purpose. Therefore, we should not use such a shofar from such an animal for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>This halachah applies before the blood from the sacrifice has been offered on the altar. Afterwards, the skin and horns of the animal become the property of the priests and may be used for mundane purposes (Rashi, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3",do not apply concerning sound alone. -," In <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 5:16, the Rambam writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Concerning the sound, sight, and smell of consecrated objects: We should not derive benefit from them. However, all the implications of the prohibition against using them for mundane purposes do not apply."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3",Mitzvot were not given for our benefit -," Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) states: ""the mitzvot were not given to the Jewish people for their enjoyment, but rather as a yoke.""</p>
<p>This concept has relevance in the ethical, as well as the halachic sphere. In the tenth chapter of <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One who serves [God] out of love occupies himself with the Torah and the mitzvot...for no ulterior motive, not because of fear that evil will occur, nor in order to acquire benefit...</p>
<p>The great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: ""Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a gift. Rather, since he is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him""; i.e., serve [Him] out of love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is not intended to imply that a person should not feel happy and fulfilled in the service of God. Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service. We should be totally committed to fulfilling God's will, and the expression of that commitment should generate satisfaction and joy."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.4",Regarding a shofar to be used on Rosh HaShanah: It is forbidden to violate the festival laws to obtain it. This applies -," not only when obtaining the shofar requires the violation of a <i>melachah</i> (forbidden labor) prohibited by the Torah, but"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.4",How is the above exemplified? If there is a shofar in a treetop or across a river - and that is the only shofar available - one may not climb the tree -," lest one accidentally cut off a branch (ibid., 6)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.4","Needless to say, we may not cut the shofar [from the animal's head] -"," In his commentary on the mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to cutting the horn off with a household knife. Since a craftsman's knife is not being used, cutting the shofar off is not forbidden by Torah law. Nevertheless, the Rambam uses the expression ""needless to say,"" because such an activity bears a closer resemblance to one forbidden by Torah law than those mentioned previously."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.4",[to prepare a shofar so that we may blow it].,
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.4",while [the observance of] the festivals fulfills both a positive and a negative commandment. -," In <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 1:2, the Rambam writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever rests from a <i>melachah</i> categorized as ""work"" on one of [these days] fulfills a positive commandment, because the Torah describes them as ""days of rest""... if one performs a <i>melachah</i> that is not intended to prepare food,... one negates the performance of a positive commandment and transgresses a negative commandment, as [<a href=""/9924#v8"">Leviticus 23:8</a>] states: ""You shall not perform any servile work."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.4","It is permitted to rinse a shofar with water, wine, or vinegar in order to improve its tone. -"," It is forbidden to prepare a utensil for use on a festival. (See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 4:8.) However, this activity is not placed in that category (Rabbenu Manoach)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.5",The minimum size of a shofar is [a measure] sufficient that one may hold the shofar in one's hands [with the ends] visibly [protruding] -, The protrusions are necessary lest one say that a person is producing the sounds by blowing into his hands without a shofar.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.5",Should a shofar be cracked lengthwise -," i.e., from its mouth to its end;"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.5",Should it be cracked along its width -," with the crack extending along the majority of the shofar's circumference (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> ibid., 9),"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.5",it is kosher. -," This applies even if the sound of the shofar is changed because of the crack (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.5",[Regarding a shofar with] a hole: If it was plugged -," In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 3:5), the Rambam writes that the hole must be plugged. This point is not accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 7), which emphasizes that if the hole is not plugged, the shofar is kosher even though its sound has changed. Nevertheless, the Ramah states that if another shofar is available, a shofar with a hole should not be used."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.5",it is unacceptable -," because the sound produced does not come from the shofar alone, but rather from the shofar and the other substance."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.5","a) it was plugged with its own kind,",
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.5",b) the majority of the shofar remained whole;,
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.5","If one [merely] perforated the insides of the horn, -", the bonelike tissue inside the horn
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.6",If one made any addition to a shofar -, whether from the mouthpiece or from the wider end (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 586:11).
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.6",or from another substance - it is unacceptable. -," On the surface, this law appears to be an extension of the principle mentioned in the last clause of the previous halachah. If so, one might question why the Rambam mentions them in two separate halachot."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.6","from the inside or at the mouthpiece, it is unacceptable -"," for the sound must come from the shofar itself. Though <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b mentions that the mouth of the shofar used in the Temple was coated with gold, the place where the person blowing would put his mouth was not covered."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.6","on the outside: If its sound is changed from what it was originally, it is not acceptable -"," for then, the sound we hear is a product of both the shofar and the coating, and not the shofar alone.</p>
<p>Based on this law, the Ramban advises against making designs in the shofar and coating them with paint or metal, for this may alter the shofar's sound and prevent the <i>teki'ot</i> from being acceptable."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.6","Should one place one shofar within another: If one hears the sound of the inner shofar, -"," i.e., with the further end of the inner shofar protruding beyond that of the outer shofar"

Hence, it was customary to rinse it with water or wine, as mentioned in Halachah 4."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.8",When a person sounds a shofar within a pit or within a cave -," Rav Hai Gaon writes that these laws were not merely questions of abstract theory. Rather, they carried practical relevance in the Talmudic period, when the Jews frequently had to perform mitzvot clandestinely, to avoid being observed by the Roman authorities."

Blessings 6.1,Anyone who eats bread over which the blessing hamotzi is recited -," The commentaries explain that the modifying clause is added to include two types of grain products mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 9, that resemble bread, but do not require the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> unless they are eaten as the basis for an entire meal. When the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> is recited over them, the ritual washing of the hands is also required. Otherwise, it is not (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 158:1)."
Blessings 6.1,before -," <i>Shabbat</i> 14b, 15a states that the washing of the hands before partaking of sacrificial offerings was instituted by King Solomon. Hillel and Shammai extended the practice to include <i>terumah</i>, and Rabbi Eleazar ben Arach widened its scope to include even unconsecrated foods (<i>Chulin</i> 106a).</p>
<p>The latter decree was also intended to remind the priests to keep their hands ritually pure while partaking of <i>terumah</i>. It was, however, instituted not only for the priests, but for the nation as a whole (even though non-priests may not partake of <i>terumah</i>), so that it would be a universally accepted practice.</p>
<p>Even after the destruction of the Temple, when it was no longer possible to practice ritual purity, this mitzvah was continued in the hope that the Temple will soon be rebuilt, and the priests will resume continue their previous obligations (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 158:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 158:1)."

See also Chapter 7, Note 17."
Blessings 6.1,in liquid -," Liquid in this instance refers to wine, honey, olive oil, milk, dew, and water. It does not include fruit juices or other oils (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 158:4)."
Blessings 6.2,Whenever a person washes his hands - whether before eating -," The Rambam requires that a blessing be recited in both the instances mentioned in the previous halachah. As mentioned in the commentary, our practice is to recite a blessing only before partaking of bread, and not before partaking of foods dipped in liquids."
Blessings 6.2,or before prayer -," See <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:2-3.</p>
<p>The Radbaz (Vol. IV, Responsum 1365) states that although the Rambam requires that we wash before the afternoon and evening services, a blessing should be recited only when washing before the morning service. This opinion is reinforced by the fact that, when counting the hundred blessings recited each day (<i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 7:14), the Rambam enumerates only one blessing for washing for prayer."
Blessings 6.2,"""[Blessed are You...] who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the washing of hands."" -"," The word ""washing"" is not a precise translation of the Hebrew נטילת. Rabbenu Asher (<i>Berachot</i>, Chapter 9) explains that this term was used because in Talmudic times, the utensil with which it was customary to wash one's hands was called נטלא. The Sages phrased the blessing in this manner to emphasize that the mere rinsing of one's hands is insufficient and one must use such a utensil."
Blessings 6.2,is a Rabbinic mitzvah that we have been commanded by the Torah to follow -," In Chapter 11, Halachah 3, the Rambam interprets the blessing recited over Rabbinic commandments as follows: ""who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to follow the instructions of the Sages who commanded us concerning...."""
Blessings 6.2,"A blessing should not, however, be recited before washing after eating -"," Although the Ra'avad protests strongly the Rambam's ruling, it is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 181:7). (The difference between the Ra'avad and the Rambam revolves around the rationale for this washing. See Note 3 below.)"
Blessings 6.4,To what point should one's hands be washed? To the wrist. -," Although Rabbenu Asher maintains that it is only necessary to wash to the point of connection between the fingers and the hand, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 161:4) accepts the Rambam's decision. Nevertheless, when a person has only a limited supply of water, he may rely on Rabbenu Asher's opinion (Shulchan Aruch HaRav 161:8; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 161:22)."
Blessings 6.4,a] revi'it -," one fourth of a larger measure known as a <i>log</i>. In contemporary measure, a <i>revi'it</i> is equivalent to 86.6 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 150 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</p>
<p>A <i>revi'it</i> is significant in this context because immersion in a <i>revi'it</i> of water is enough to restore ritual purity to a utensil according to Torah law. The Rabbis, however, obligated the use of a <i>mikveh</i> of 40 <i>se'ah</i> for all ritual immersions."
Blessings 6.4,Anything that is considered an intervening substance [and thus invalidates] a ritual immersion -," In <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 1:12, the Rambam provides this general rule:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Any substance that intervenes [between one's flesh and the water] and disturbs one nullifies the immersion, even if it covers only a minor portion of one's flesh.... Any substance that covers the major portion of one's flesh nullifies the immersion, even though it does not disturb one.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2 of those halachot, the Rambam mentions a long list of particular substances that nullify immersions, including filth, mud, and dough."
Blessings 6.4,All liquids that may be included in the measure of a <i>mikveh</i> -," This includes substances like ice and snow, which can be used to make up the measure of a <i>mikveh</i> (<i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 7:3)."

Blessings 6.11,"to use for washing, it is acceptable. -"," Although the covering was not originally made to contain liquid, since it was modified with that intention and, in its present state, it can contain a <i>revi'it</i> without being supported, it is acceptable."
Blessings 6.11,may be used for the washing of hands. -," The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159) questions why any modification is necessary for a wine-pouch, since it is also originally made with the intention of containing liquids. It explains that generally, if left uncovered, without a stand, a pouch will not be able to contain water. Hence, unless a stand is made for it, it is unacceptable."
Blessings 6.11,may not be used to wash hands. -," The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) explains the difference between these and the former two instances:</p>
<p>The purpose for which a covering of a jug and a wine pouch are made is related to the containing of liquids. Accordingly, although without modification they cannot serve that purpose in a manner acceptable for use in washing hands, once they are modified they are acceptable. In contrast, a sack or a basket is never used to contain liquids. Therefore, even after modification, it is unacceptable."
Blessings 6.11,Vessels that have been broken to the extent that the laws of ritual impurity no longer apply to them -," <i>Hilchot Keilim</i>, Chapters 6, 11, and 19, relates the following general principle: Once a vessel is broken to the point that it can no longer serve its original purpose, it is no longer considered a vessel and can no longer contract ritual impurity.</p>
<p><i>Chulin</i> 107a mentions that a vessel that is used for containing liquids becomes disqualified when it contains a hole large enough to allow liquids to enter when the vessel is placed within them."

Based on the same sources, Rabbenu Tam requires that the strands be at least twelve fingerbreadths long. His opinion is accepted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:4) and the later authorities."
Fringes 1.6,"The term ""fingerbreadth"" refers to a thumbbreadth. -"," See <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> 9:9. In contemporary measure, a thumbbreadth is approximately 2 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 2.4 centimeters according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>."

<p>As explained in <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 1:11, any time when an activity must be carried out <i>lishmah</i>, it cannot be performed by a gentile. Therefore, the strands may not be spun by a gentile alone (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:1)."

Fringes 1.11,which came from an ir hanidachat -," An <i>ir hanidachat</i> is a city condemned to be destroyed because the majority of its inhabitants worshiped idols.

Fringes 1.12,"If, however, a Jew made tzitzit without the intention [that they be used for the mitzvah], they are acceptable. -"," This principle can be derived from the above concept. Were it necessary for the tzitzit to be tied with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah, there would be no need for a special verse from the Torah to teach that those made by a gentile are unacceptable. The concept would be self-explanatory. Whenever a deed must be performed with a specific intention, a gentile's acts are not acceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</p>
<p>The Ashkenazic authorities do not accept this premise and maintain that, at the very least, the strands must be attached to the garment with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:2.)"
Reading the Shema 1.1,"We [are obligated to] recite the Shema twice daily, in the evening and in the morning - as [<a href=""/9970#v7"">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>] states: ""...when you lie down and when you rise"" -"," In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 10), the Rambam mentions the beginning of this verse, ודברת בם... (And you shall speak of them...) as the source for the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his statements in this halachah do not necessarily represent a change of mind. Here, the Rambam is not interested in the actual source for the mitzvah itself (which is the case in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>), but in stating our obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> twice daily, once at night and once in the daytime. This is derived from the end of the verse, as mentioned by the Rambam."
Reading the Shema 1.2,And what is it that one recites? -," There are various opinions as to what constitutes the positive commandment of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 419) states clearly that the Torah obligates us to read only the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> - i.e., <i>Shema Yisrael</i>. The reading of the rest of the three sections was instituted by the Sages.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Yonah understands that the whole first section constitutes the Torah obligation. (See <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 63 at the end.) There is also an opinion that the obligation to recite the first two sections originates in the Torah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 58.) However, in practice, everyone ultimately agrees that one must recite all three sections mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah (<i>Berachot</i> 13a)."
Reading the Shema 1.2,since it contains [the concept of] the unity of God -," The statement ""God is our Lord, God is one"" implies not only that there is only one God, but all creation is one with Him. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:6."
Reading the Shema 1.2,the study of Torah -," ""... and you shall teach your children and speak of them"" (<a href=""/9970#v7"">Deuteronomy 6:7)</a>.</p>
<p>It must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, the Rambam quotes <a href=""/9975#v19"">Deuteronomy 11:19</a> (a verse in the second section of the <i>Shema</i>), as the source for the mitzvah of Torah study."
Reading the Shema 1.3,The commandment of tzitzit is not obligatory at night -," <a href=""/9943#v39"">Numbers 15:39</a> states: ""And you shall see them..."" - implying that <i>tzitzit</i> must only be worn when they can be seen, i.e., daytime. Accordingly, there is no obligation to wear <i>tzitzit</i> at night. See <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:7-8."
Reading the Shema 1.3,We are commanded to mention the exodus from Egypt both during the day and at night -," See <i>Berachot</i> 12b.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam does not count the mentioning of the exodus from Egypt as one of the 613 commandments in the Torah, nor does he mention it elsewhere in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</p>
<p>The Rambam does, however, count the commandment of the telling of the story of the exodus on the fifteenth of <i>Nisan</i> - i.e., Passover night - as one of the mitzvot. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 21), and <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i>, Chapters 7 and 8.</p>
<p>According to some opinions, one can differentiate between the two obligations as follows: A person can fulfill his daily obligation with simply a thought about the exodus, whereas on <i>Pesach</i> night the mitzvah can be performed only through the verbal description of the redemption from Egypt. (See <i>Sha'agat Aryeh</i>, 13.)</p>
<p>This would explain the omission of this commandment from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. A commandment that can be fulfilled with a thought alone and not an explicit statement or action is not ""worthy"" of inclusion in the list of 613 commandments of the Torah. (See the Rambam's explanation of the commandment to remember Amalek: Positive Commandment 189).</p>
<p>The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, however, disagrees with this opinion. In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 67, he states that even the daily obligation requires an explicit statement. Nevertheless, he explains that it was not chosen as one of the 613 commandments because the obligation to remember the exodus twice daily is not stated in the form of a command in the Torah to ""Remember,"" but rather, as a reason for another mitzvah (the mitzvah of <i>matzah</i>): ""In order that you shall remember..."" (<a href=""/9980#v3"">Deuteronomy 16:3)</a>."
Reading the Shema 1.4,"When reciting the Shema, after completing the first verse, one says quietly: ""Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom forever."" -"," This phrase is recited quietly because it is not part of the section of the <i>Shema</i> as it appears in the Torah, but rather was recited by Jacob in Egypt, as explained later in this halachah.</p>
<p>It is, however, pronounced loudly on Yom Kippur. <i>Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer</i> explains that the angels praise God with this verse. On Yom Kippur, we are as pure as angels and thus, emulate their practice (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).</p>
<p>It is preferable to separate clearly between the end of ""Blessed be the name"" - i.e., the words לעולם ועד - forever, and the beginning of the next section, ואהבת (And you shall love...) (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 61)."
Reading the Shema 1.4,"It is our tradition that when the patriarch, Jacob, gathered all his sons together in Egypt close to his death -"," See Genesis, Chapter 49."
Reading the Shema 1.4,"He asked them: ""My sons, perhaps there are dregs among you, one who does not stand with me in the Unity of God?"" -"," What would cause Jacob to have such a doubt regarding his children? One of the greatest merits of Jacob is that he - unlike Avraham, who fathered Yishmael, and Yitzchak, who had Esau as a son - had only righteous children.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains that Jacob desired to reveal the secret of the end of days to his children, but that this knowledge suddenly left him. He was worried that perhaps his sudden lack of understanding was due to the imperfect state of his children and therefore, felt compelled to ask them about their faith in the One God.</p>
<p>The Rambam omits all these particulars, since they are not relevant to the matter at hand - namely, the source of the custom of saying ""Blessed be the name..."" after ""<i>Shema Yisrael</i>..."""
Reading the Shema 1.4,"They all answered and said: ""Listen, Israel, -"," Jacob is also called by that name (<a href=""/8227#v29"">Genesis 32:29)</a>."

Reading the Shema 1.7,"The first blessing preceding it, both in the day and at night, begins ""Blessed [are You, God our Lord...]"" and concludes ""Blessed [are You, God...]"" -"," The first blessing in a series of blessings generally possesses a <i>p'tichah</i>, as well as a <i>chatimah</i>. Other examples of this are the first blessing in the silent <i>Amidah</i> prayer and the blessing with which we begin grace after meals."
Reading the Shema 1.7,"These blessings and all the rest of the blessings familiar to the Jewish people were instituted by Ezra, the scribe, and his court -"," This is a general statement. In particular, there are some blessings that were not established by Ezra, but rather by the Sages of the Mishnah. See <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2:1 and <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 2:1."
Reading the Shema 1.7,"In every instance that they decreed to conclude with ""Blessed..."" -"," e.g., all the blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, the silent <i>Amidah</i> prayer and grace after meals. (See the introduction to this halachah in order to understand the following laws fully.)"

Reading the Shema 1.7,"Where they decreed to begin [with ""Blessed...""] -"," e.g., the first blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, the silent <i>Amidah</i> prayer and grace after meals."
Reading the Shema 1.7,The general principle is that anyone who deviates from the set form of blessings established by the Sages is mistaken and must recite the blessing again in its proper form -," This decision is based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 11a).</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> (1:5-6), the Rambam writes that a person who mentions the central ideas contained in the <i>p'tichah</i> - i.e., the name of God and His sovereignty - even were he to deviate from the set form of the blessing, would fulfill his obligation.</p>
<p>We must understand the present halachah in this context. Only when one deviates from the <i>p'tichah</i> or <i>chatimah</i> of a blessing does the Rambam require the recitation of another blessing. However, a person who maintains the nature of the <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i>, but changes the wording of the rest of the blessing, fulfills his obligation as long as the basic intent of the blessing remains."
Reading the Shema 1.8,One who recites the second blessing -," e.g., <i>Ahavat Olam<br/></i></p>
<p>before the first - e.g., <i>yotzer or</i>,</p>
<p>Even in such an instance, the second blessing should be recited without a <i>p'tichah</i>, since it usually follows another blessing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). See also <i>Magen Avraham</i> on <i>Orach Chayim</i> 60:3."
Reading the Shema 1.8,"fulfills his obligation, since there is no absolute order to the blessings -"," ""And what does it mean that blessings are not an integral and necessary requirement? This refers to the order of the blessings"" (<i>Berachot</i> 12a)."
Reading the Shema 1.8,"and concludes with ""...the One who brings the evenings"" -"," i.e., Blessed are You O God, who brings the evenings (המעריב ערבים), this being the proper <i>chatimah</i> for the first blessing at night."
Reading the Shema 1.8,"Were he to begin with ""...the One who brings the evenings"" -"," i.e., ""Blessed are You O God, our Lord, King of the universe, who, through His word, makes evenings fall (אשר בדברו מעריב ערבים),"" this being the proper <i>p'tichah</i> for the first blessing at night."
Reading the Shema 1.8,he would fulfill his obligation -, since the <i>chatimah</i> is proper.
Reading the Shema 1.8,"...and conclude with ""...the One who forms the light"" -"," i.e., ""Blessed are You O God, the One who forms the lights (יוצר המאורות),"" this being the proper <i>chatimah</i> for the first blessing in the day."
Reading the Shema 1.8,"If he begins with ""...the One who forms light"" -"," i.e., ""Blessed are You O God, our Lord, King of the Universe, who forms light and creates darkness (יוצר אור ובורא חושך),"" this being the <i>p'tichah</i> for the first blessing in the day."
Reading the Shema 1.9,When is the [proper] time for the recitation of Shema at night? The commandment [starts] from the time of the appearance of the stars... -," The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) states that the time for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> begins at the hour when a priest who has become ritually impure may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and resume eating <i>terumah</i>. The Talmud explains that this is the time when the stars appear.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) holds that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited earlier, during the last hour before sunset. This is based on the understanding that Rabbi Yehudah, who disagrees with the majority opinion regarding the proper time for the afternoon prayer, also disagrees about the proper time for the evening prayer and <i>Kri'at Shema</i> contained therein. (See <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 235.) This will be discussed at length in <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 3:6.</p>
<p>There are several different positions regarding the precise definition of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). It generally refers to the appearance of three medium-sized stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 235:1 requires the sighting of three small stars before reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of צאת הכוכבים, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night.</p>
<p>There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.</p>
<p>The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines צאת הכוכבים as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.</p>
<p>There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary to the mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 3:2, maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars <a href=""/15944#v1"">is 13 1</a>/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that צאת הכוכבים is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.</p>
<p>According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other."
Reading the Shema 1.9,fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn. -," In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam defines dawn (עלות השחר) as the light that radiates from the east before sunrise.</p>
<p>There are three major positions regarding this time. All are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 94a which defines the time from dawn until sunrise as that in which a person can walk either 4 <i>mil</i> (according to one opinion) or 5 <i>mil</i> (according to the other).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two opinions regarding the measure of time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>: 18 minutes or 24 minutes. Thus, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi defines dawn as 120 (5 x 24) minutes before sunrise. The most widely held view is that it is 90 (5 x 18) minutes before sunrise, while the <i>Beit Yosef</i> holds that dawn is 72 (4 x 18) minutes before sunrise. This is the opinion of the Rambam, as stated in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)"
Reading the Shema 1.10,[but] before sunrise -, the last possible time that could be defined as night
Reading the Shema 1.11,When is the proper time [for the recitation of the Shema] during the day? The commandment is that one should start to read before sunrise -," The Mishnah, (<i>Berachot</i> 9b) records a disagreement regarding the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning.</p>
<p>An anonymous position sees the earliest possible time as when one can distinguish between <i>techelet</i> (blue-green) and white. Rabbi Eliezer says: Between green and blue-green - i.e., later - and that the time lasts until sunrise. Rabbi Yehoshua says that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> ""until three hours.""</p>
<p>The Talmud then adds various other opinions and quotes Abaye as saying that the <i>Shema</i> should be recited כותיקין - i.e., one should finish reciting the <i>Shema</i> as the sun rises, in order to start the silent <i>Amidah</i> with the sunrise.</p>
<p>The Rambam clearly prefers this position and establishes 6 minutes as a reasonable amount of time to recite the <i>Shema</i> and the blessing after it, in order to start the <i>Amidah</i> at the proper time. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 58:1) explains that all opinions agree that the commandment to recite <i>Shema</i> in the morning begins at dawn. The only disagreement revolves around the optimum time to recite <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Vilna Gaon differs and explains that the Rambam holds that Abaye's position states the actual time of the beginning of the commandment itself and that it may be recited earlier only in extraordinary circumstances."
Reading the Shema 1.11,This measure [of time] is one-tenth of an hour before the sun rises -," This is based on the verse in <a href=""/16293#v5"">Psalms 72:5</a>, ""May they fear You with the sun"" - i.e., may they show their fear for You with the Amidah as the sun rises (<i>Berachot</i> 9b). The Talmud promises that anyone who recites the <i>Shema</i> and the Amidah at this time is guaranteed a place in the World to Come."
Reading the Shema 1.12,"One who is overhasty and recites the Shema of the morning prayers after dawn, even though he finishes before sunrise, fulfills his obligation. -"," This implies that this is not most desirable. Rather, prefarably, the <i>Shema</i> should be read immediately before sunrise, and any other time is clearly considered second best."
Reading the Shema 1.13,"One who recited [the Shema] after [the end of] the third hour, even if he was unavoidably detained, does not fulfill his obligation to recite the Shema at its proper time. -"," The morning <i>Shema</i> must be recited ""when you rise"" (<a href=""/9970#v7"">Deuteronomy 6:7)</a>. The latest time of rising is understood as the end of the third hour, the time that royalty rises (<i>Berachot</i> 9b). Even if a particular individual rises afterwards, he is considered as an exception and no leniency is granted.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions why <i>Kri'at Shema</i> may be read in the daytime until only the end of the third hour.<br/>
Just as the obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> at night lasts the entire night because the entire night is a time of lying down, so too, the <i>Shema</i> of the daytime should be recited all day, since the entire day is a time of being up.</p>
<p>The <i>Taz</i> (58:6) distinguishes between the nighttime, all of which is indeed a time of lying down, and the daytime. There are many acts that one does during the day - e.g., walking, sitting and eating - while rising is generally done at the beginning of the day."
Reading the Shema 1.13,He should recite the blessings -, mentioned in Halachot 5-7.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 8.1",There are two forms for a passage -," The Torah is divided into 669 passages, each containing one or more verses. There are two structures with which they are written: <i>p'tuchah</i> (described in this halachah) and <i>s'tumah</i> (described in the following halachah)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 8.1",[One form is used] when one completes [the previous passage] in the midst of the line -," as explained below, leaving an empty space large enough to contain nine letters."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 8.1",When is [this form] used? When the empty space is large enough to contain nine letters. -," In Chapter 7, Halachah 10, the Rambam defines this measure as enough space to write the word רשא three times. In this context, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 275) states that, after the fact, a scroll is not disqualified if a space necessary to write nine <i>yuddim</i> is left open."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.1,"When a person checks and searches on the night of the fourteenth [of Nisan], he should remove [all] chametz from holes, hidden places, and corners --"," In the second chapter (Halachot 2:3-2:6), the Rambam discusses the theoretical aspects of the search for chametz. In this chapter, he concentrates on their practical application."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.1,"and [then,] destroy it --"," as explained in Halachah 11, below."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.2,The chametz which was put aside on the night of the fourteenth --," The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 434:1) explains that the same law applies to the chametz found in the search. Nevertheless, only the chametz set aside for eating is mentioned, for it is possible that no chametz will actually be found in the search."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.2,"should not be spread out and scattered in every place. Rather, it should be put away in a utensil or in a known corner, and care should be taken concerning it --"," Accordingly, <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> cautions that the chametz should be covered by a bowl, placed in a cabinet, or hung from the ceiling."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.3,When the fourteenth falls on the Sabbath --," the Pesach holiday being celebrated Saturday night. According to the fixed calendar we follow, this is an infrequent, but not totally uncommon, phenomenon."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.3,the night of the thirteenth --," between the twelfth and the thirteenth. Searching with a candle is forbidden on the Sabbath itself. Hence, the search for leaven is carried out on Thursday night. The chametz that is collected is burned on Friday morning."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.3,until [the end of] the fourth hour on the Sabbath day --," when the Rabbinic prohibition against eating chametz (Halachah 1:9) takes effect. Before that time, the chametz saved for the Sabbath meals should have been completed and disposed of in a way other than burning - e.g., throwing it in the toilet."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.3,the Sabbath --," The Ra'avad notes that in <i>Pesachim</i> 49a, the majority opinion accepts this decision only as regards <i>Terumah</i>. In contrast, other chametz need not be destroyed until the appropriate time on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 444) explains that the Rambam's decision is based on <i>Pesachim</i> 13b, which differs from the opinion in <i>Pesachim</i> 49a. However, even according to the Rambam, the obligation to destroy the chametz before the Sabbath is not a hard and fast rule. On the contrary, our halachah itself states that one is allowed to keep all the chametz he needs for the Sabbath meals. Rather, this can be seen as good advice, facilitating the destruction of chametz, which is much easier before the Sabbath than on that sacred day."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.3,and cover it with a utensil --," so it is not seen. This obligation is derived from <i>Pesachim</i> 6a, which states such a law as regards chametz discovered on the first day of the festival."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.4,A person who has many loaves of bread that were Terumah and must burn them on the Sabbath eve --," i.e., when Passover comes out Saturday night and the chametz must be destroyed on Friday as explained in the previous halachah."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.4,"Rather, he should burn the pure loaves alone, the impure ones alone, --"," Based on <i>Pesachim</i> 15b and 20b, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and Rabbenu Manoach explain that the same principles apply when burning <i>Terumah</i> every Pesach eve until the end of the sixth hour. However, afterwards, when chametz is forbidden according to Torah law, no differentiation is made, and both pure and impure <i>Terumah</i> are burned together."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.4,is] left pending --," because of a question which arose whether they became impure or not. Generally, they would not be used as food for perhaps they are impure, nor are they burned immediately as impure Terumah, because perhaps they are pure, and the destruction of pure <i>Terumah</i> for no purpose is forbidden. Rather, they are left until they are no longer fit for use, and then burned."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.4,"He should leave a sufficient quantity, but no more than necessary --"," These words of qualification are added as regards <i>Terumah</i> in contrast to other chametz. (See the previous halachah.) Other chametz is fit to be eaten by all people or beasts. In contrast, <i>Terumah</i> can be eaten only by a priest's household. Hence, greater precautions should be taken not to leave over extra amounts (Rabbenu Manoach)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.5,A person who either inadvertently or intentionally did not search on the night of the fourteenth should search on the fourteenth in the morning --," Even though searching with a candle at night is preferable, as explained in Halachot 2:3-4, if that is impossible the search should be carried out as soon as possible the following morning."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.5,he should search at the time for destroying [the chametz] --, before the completion of the fifth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.5,"If the festival passed without his having searched, he should search after the festival, to destroy whatever chametz he might find which [he possessed] during Pesach --"," This applies even if the person nullified his chametz, and thus did not transgress the prohibitions against possessing chametz on the holiday. Were he not to destroy this chametz, it would be obvious that he had not totally negated his ownership over the chametz, and thus his nullification would be proven as invalid retroactively."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.6,"When a person checks for chametz on the night of the fourteenth, on the day of the fourteenth --"," Though, as explained in Halachah 2:3, the search for chametz is only a Rabbinic obligation if one nullifies his chametz, blessings are also recited when fulfilling Rabbinic commandments. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:3.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.6,he should recite the [following] blessing before he begins to search: --, <i>Pesachim</i> 7b emphasizes that all blessings should be recited before the performance of the mitzvah.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.6,"He must check and search in all the places where chametz is brought in, as was explained --", in Halachah 2:3.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.7,"When he concludes searching, if he searched on the fourteenth at night, or on the fourteenth during the day before the sixth hour, he should nullify all the chametz --", as stated in Halachah 2:2.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.7,that he does not see --," for the chametz that is seen must be destroyed, as stated in Halachah 2:3.</p>
<p>He should say — The text in most Haggadot is in Aramaic, because that was the language of the common people in Talmudic times. A person who does not understand that text must make the declaration in a language that he comprehends."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.7,"behold, it is nullified and must be considered as dust."" --"," The text in most Haggadot states ""dust of the earth."" <a href=""/16430#v6"">Job 28:6</a> uses the expression עפרות זהב ""gold dust,"" a substance with obvious worth. By stating ""the dust of the earth"" we imply that we attach no value to the chametz at all."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.8,"Thus, a person who does not nullify [his chametz] before the sixth hour --"," The Ra'avad questions the phraseology used by the Rambam, noting that the prohibitions against owning chametz do not begin until the evening. On the day of the fourteenth of Nisan, there is only a positive commandment to destroy chametz.</p>
<p>Most commentaries explain that the Rambam himself intended this interpretation. However, some note that Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 4b) does maintain that the prohibitions against owning chametz begin on the fourteenth, and they maintain that the Rambam shares this view (See Responsa, <i>Nodah BiYhudah, Orach Chayim</i> 20)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.8,which he considered important and [valued] in his heart --," <i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 6b) states that the prohibitions only apply when the chametz has an intrinsic value, in contrast to crumbs."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.8,"Even so, the Torah considers it as if it were in his possession, to obligate him for transgression of the commandments: ""[leaven] shall not be seen"" and ""[leaven] shall not be found."" --"," <i>Pesachim</i> (6b) compares the possession of chametz at this time to digging a pit in the public thoroughfare. The pit does not belong to the person who dug it; nevertheless, he must pay for any damages it causes.</p>
<p>Similarly, with regard to chametz, since one is forbidden to benefit from it, it is no longer considered in one's possession and cannot be sold, bartered, or given away. Nevertheless, the person retaining it is still liable for transgression of the prohibitions involved."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.8,"he should cover it with a utensil until the evening, and then destroy it. --"," This statement raises questions among many of the commentators. In Halachah 3, the Rambam also mentions covering chametz with a utensil. However, in that instance, the person had already nullified his possession of the chametz, and thus his possession of chametz violated only a Rabbinic prohibition.</p>
<p>In contrast, this instance describes chametz that has not been nullified, and thus the violation of a Torah prohibition is involved. Nevertheless, the Rambam considers the Rabbinic prohibition against <i>mukzteh</i> as important enough to override the fulfillment of a Torah commandment. Furthermore, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since the person himself desires to destroy the chametz, and the only reason he fails to do so is the Rabbinic commandment, he is not considered to have violated the Torah's prohibitions against possessing chametz.</p>
<p>This view is not accepted by all authorities. Many explain that since three Torah mitzvot (the two prohibitions against possessing chametz and the positive commandment to destroy chametz) are involved, their observance overrides the prohibitions of <i>muktzeh</i>. Others maintain that even if the prohibition against <i>muktzeh</i> must be observed, the chametz can be destroyed by burning it in the place where it is located.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in practice, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 446:2), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> do not accept the latter view, and advise waiting to destroy the chametz until after the holiday. They explain that a person is allowed to light a fire on a festival only if doing so increases his festive joy. Hence, they prohibit burning the chametz in that manner. However, they mention that, if it is possible, a gentile may be asked to destroy the chametz. Furthermore, in the diaspora, a Jew is also allowed to destroy chametz he finds on the second day of a festival."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.9,A person who left his house before the time for destroying chametz in order to fulfill a mitzvah --, The Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 49a) mentions a person who goes out to slaughter the Paschal sacrifice or circumcise his son. The Rambam postulates that the same applies to anyone who leaves his home to perform any mitzvah.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.9,"e.g., a feast associated with betrothal or marriage --"," In Judaism, marriage is a two stage process. Betrothal (אירוסין) involves the consecration of a woman as a wife. However, the new couple do not live together as man and wife until marriage (נישואין) (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:1-2.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.9,If not --," If returning home to destroy the chametz will cause him to neglect the fulfillment of the mitzvah with which he is involved,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.9,Should he go out to save --, people's lives
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.9,Should he go out for his own purposes --, to deal with his own business affairs
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.9,How much [chametz] must be present [to require] him to return? the size of an egg --," The prohibition against eating chametz applies regarding a size of an olive (one third the size of an egg, according to the Rambam). However, the Sages showed leniency, since the nullification of chametz is sufficient according to Torah law. They did not require a person to return to destroy chametz unless a quantity the size of an egg, the measure associated with ritual purity and impurity, was found."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.10,A person who put aside a rolled dough --," a dough that was kneaded, but which had not yet risen."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.10,"[forgot about it,] went out and remembered after he had left [home]: Should he be sitting before his teacher --"," and thus leaving would be a sign of disrespect to his teacher.</p>
<p>This example is given by the Talmud. Nevertheless, when quoting this halachah, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 444:8) states: ""Were he busy with other matters,"" implying that the law applies even when one's intent is not necessarily associated with a mitzvah."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.10,"behold, he may nullify [ownership over the dough] in his heart before it becomes leaven --"," Since the dough has not become leaven, its possession is still permitted. Hence, a person is still entitled to nullify his ownership of it.</p>
<p>Once he has nullified his ownership of the dough, its presence in his house does not constitute a violation of the prohibitions against the possession of chametz, because it no longer belongs to him.</p>
<p>At present, people very infrequently bake matzah on Pesach itself in Ashkenazic communities. However, it is customary to do so in certain Sephardic communities. When preparing the dough, the women always nullify their ownership of any small pieces of dough that become stuck to the kneading pin or bowl before they become leavened, so that they will not possess even the slightest amount of chametz. (See <i>Hagahot Maimoni</i>.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.10,"for he has already violated [the prohibitions]: ""[leaven] shall not be seen"" and ""[leaven] shall not be found."" He must destroy it immediately --", or cover it with a utensil if this occurs on the day of the festival itself.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.11,How must chametz be destroyed? --," Halachah 2:2 explains that the mitzvah ""to destroy chametz"" is fulfilled by nullifying one's ownership of it. This halachah refers to the Rabbinic prohibition to destroy all known chametz; alternatively, to the destruction of chametz discovered after the beginning of the sixth hour."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.11,"If the chametz is hard and the sea will not cause it to dissolve speedily, one should crumble it and then throw it into the sea. --"," In his commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 2:1), the Rambam writes that dried bread should be crumbled ""a lot"" before being thrown to the sea. <i>Pesachim</i> 28a records a debate among the Sages whether it is necessary to crumble all chametz before throwing it to the sea. There is extensive debate among the commentators regarding the Rambam's interpretation of this passage. Most halachic authorities (<i>Taz, Orach Chayim</i> 445:1) require chametz to be crumbled even before it is tossed into the sea."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.11,"it is considered as having been destroyed. [Nevertheless,] one must nullify [ownership over] it in one's heart if the sixth hour has not arrived --"," Thus, even if the chametz is uncovered during Pesach, it will no longer be within one's possession (Rashi, <i>Pesachim</i> ibid.)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.11,it to a gentile before the sixth hour need not destroy it --," <i>Pesachim</i> 5b notes that <a href=""/9874#v7"">Exodus 13:7</a>, the verse prohibiting the possession of chametz, states: ""No chametz will be seen for you."" The addition of the latter phrase implies that there is no prohibition against chametz that belongs to a gentile being found in one's domain during Pesach. The following chapter discusses this subject in depth."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.11,"However, if he burns it from [the beginning of] the sixth hour and onward, since benefit may not be derived from it, it should not be used as fuel --", while it is being burned.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.11,One may not bake or cook with it --, even after it becomes charcoal.
Sabbath 1.1,Resting from labor - ,"Within the context of the Sabbath laws, labor does not refer to strenuous work, but rather to the performance of one of the thirty nine labors that were necessary for the construction of the Temple or a labor which is analogous to them. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 1.)</p>
<p>The Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah is significant. Our Rabbis have offered two definitions of the mitzvah of resting on the Sabbath: In his commentary on <i>Yevamot</i> 6a, the Rashba states that the mitzvah is negative in nature: one refrains from performing prohibited labors. In contrast, in his commentary on <a href=""/9924#v24"">Leviticus 23:24</a>, the Ramban explains that the mitzvah possesses a positive dimension: to spend the day in a restful frame of mind, abstaining from all activities - even those that are not forbidden labors - which would disrupt this tranquility.</p>
<p>From the Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah, it would appear that he follows the first view. From his statements in Chapter 21, Halachah 1, however, it would appear that he accepts the second perspective. (See also <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>.)"
Sabbath 1.1,"as [<a href=""/9884#v12"">Exodus 23:12</a>] states, ""And you shall rest on the seventh day."" - ","In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 9), the Rambam mentions that the commandment to rest on the Sabbath is mentioned 12 times in the Torah. <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> and others question why the Rambam cites this proof-text in particular."
Sabbath 1.1,"for [ibid. 20:10] states, ""Do not perform any labor on it."" -",<i> Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 320) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch </i>(Mitzvah 32) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
Sabbath 1.1,as a conscious act of defiance - ,"and not inadvertently.</p>
<p>The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1510) notes that the Rambam uses the expression ""willingly, as a conscious act of defiance"" with regard to the transgressions of idolatry (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 3:1), the Sabbath laws, and the laws of Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 1:1). With regard to all other transgressions punishable by <hebrew>כרת</hebrew>, the Rambam merely states ""as a conscious act of defiance.""</p>
<p>The Radbaz explains that it is possible that the Rambam mentioned the concept of ""willingly"" with regard to these three transgressions because they are the first cases of <hebrew>כרת</hebrew> mentioned in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. After mentioning the concept on these three occasions, he does not think further repetition is necessary."
Sabbath 1.1,if witnesses who administer a warning are present - ,"As explained in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 12:1-2, punishment is not administered for the violation of a transgression unless the transgressor is made aware of the punishment he could receive for his deed."
Sabbath 1.1,If he performs [labor] without being conscious of the transgression - ,"accidentally, performing a forbidden labor or doing so without awareness of the transgression involved"

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.1",They are placed on the head and tied -," The commentaries note the difference between the two verbs, ""placed"" and ""tied."" See also our commentary on Chapter 4, Halachah 4. It is, nevertheless, worth noting that in the listing of the mitzvot in the introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam mentions ""tying the <i>tefillin</i> on the head."""
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.1","According to Torah law, even a mere point of one of the letters -"," for example, the <i>yud</i> has a short foot in its lower right-hand corner.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.3",and eight involve the coverings [placed around the passages] and the tying of their straps. -," These eight conditions are mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and discussed in the subsequent halachot of that chapter."

In these letters, the Rambam stresses that even after the hair is removed from the hide, it must be processed in this manner. Otherwise, it may not be used for either a Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or <i>mezuzah</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.8",It is a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai that a Torah scroll should be written on g'vil -," From <i>Bava Batra</i> 14b, it appears that Moses wrote the Torah scroll which he placed in the holy ark on <i>g'vil</i>. Similarly, <i>Gittin</i> 54b mentions that Torah scrolls would be written on <i>g'vil</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.8",When <i>tefillin</i> are written on klaf -," The Rambam's expression is somewhat inexact, because it is permissible to write <i>tefillin</i> only on <i>k'laf</i>. If they are written on <i>g'vil</i> or <i>duchsustos</i>, they are unacceptable (<i>Shabbat</i> 79b)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.8",When a <i>mezuzah</i> is written on duchsustos -," As stated in the following halachah, it is preferable - but not obligatory - to write a <i>mezuzah</i> on this type of parchment."

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.9","Similarly, if a <i>mezuzah</i> was written on k'laf or on g'vil, it is acceptable. -"," Even in Talmudic times, <i>Shabbat</i> 79b mentions that on occasion it was preferable to write a <i>mezuzah</i> on <i>k'laf</i>, because the <i>mezuzah</i> would be preserved better than if it were written on <i>duchsustos</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.10","[Torah] scrolls, <i>tefillin</i>, and mezuzot -"," <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:14 expands the scope of this law, stating that it is not befitting to write the name of God on parchment from a non-kosher animal. This applies even when the intent is not to use the parchment for a sacred purpose."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.10","One may write on the hides of [all] kosher animals, wild beasts, and fowl. -", See Halachah 20 in regard to writing on parchment made from the skin of birds.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.11",The g'vil for a Torah scroll and the k'laf for <i>tefillin</i> and for a Torah scroll must be processed with this purpose in mind. -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:8; <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1) states that when placing the skin in lime at the beginning of the process of making it into parchment, one should explicitly say that one is processing it for these purposes.</p>
<p><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (32:11) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (32:26-27) explain that parchment processed to be used as a Torah scroll may be used for <i>tefillin</i> (or for a <i>mezuzah</i>). Parchment processed for the sake of <i>tefillin</i>, however, may not be used for a Torah scroll, because a Torah scroll is on a higher level of holiness."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.11","Accordingly, if they were processed by a gentile, they are not acceptable.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.11",Therefore -, the scope of this ruling can be expanded:
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.11",it is unacceptable if made by a gentile. -," Rabbenu Asher does not accept the Rambam's ruling with regard to these parchments. Though he accepts the general principle, he explains that this particular instance is an exception.</p>
<p>In other instances, the gentile must act according to the Jew's intent for a prolonged period of time. Here, it is absolutely necessary to have the intent to use the parchment for <i>tefillin</i> or a Torah scroll only at the moment it is placed in the lime. We can assume that if a gentile is given instructions to place it in the lime with that intent, he will do so with that intent.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes both opinions in <i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:9. <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1, however, mentions only the Rambam's opinion. In both places, the Ramah states that it is customary to follow Rabbenu Asher's opinion.</p>
<p><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:12 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:28-29 quote Rabbenu Asher's statements that a Jew should be present at the time the parchment is placed in the lime and that he should explicitly tell the gentile to put it in the lime to be used for a Torah scroll. Afterwards, he should assist the gentile somewhat in the process of preparing the parchment."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.12",It is a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai that a Torah scroll or <i>mezuzah</i> should be written only [on parchment] which has been ruled. -," The parchment should be ruled with a stylus or a reed. It is improper to use a substance that leaves a mark. Each line of the parchment should be ruled and a border made on both sides. If unruled parchment is used for a Torah scroll or for a <i>mezuzah</i>, it is unacceptable (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:5, 288:8)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.12",because they are covered. -," This explains why although a verse from the Torah must always be written on ruled parchment, we are not required to do so for <i>tefillin</i>.</p>
<p>Even though a <i>mezuzah</i> is also covered, ruling the parchment is required because it can be removed from its covering easily and must be checked twice in seven years. In contrast, there is no obligation to check <i>tefillin</i> and the parchments are almost never removed from their compartments (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Nissim)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.13","A Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or <i>mezuzah</i> written by an apikoros -"," The phraseology used in this halachah is a matter of question. Though our texts follow the standard published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the authoritative manuscripts substitute the word <i>min</i> for <i>apikoros</i>.</p>
<p>The difference between the two versions is significant. In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam defines an <i>apikoros</i> as a person who denies the Torah and/or the prophetic tradition, while in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:7, he describes a <i>min</i> as a person who does not believe in God. When a <i>min</i> writes a Torah scroll, the names of God it contains do not possess any holiness, because he does not believe in God at all. In contrast, since an <i>apikoros</i> does believe in God, were he to write a Torah scroll the names he writes would possess a certain dimension of holiness."

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 39:16 explains that, at present, we can assume that the sacred articles are acceptable, because today a gentile would not know how to make them himself. Accordingly, we can assume that they were taken from a Jew.</p>

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.14","A Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or <i>mezuzah</i> that was written on parchment from a non-kosher animal, beast, or fowl -", See Halachah 10.
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.15","When a person writes a Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or <i>mezuzah</i> without having [the proper] intention -"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 274:1) states that before a scribe writes a Torah scroll, he should state that he is writing it for the sake of the holiness of a Torah scroll. Making that statement at the outset is sufficient for the entire Torah scroll. If he fails to make this statement, the scroll is not acceptable. Similar rules apply to <i>tefillin</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:19) and mezuzot.</p>
<p>Rav Chayim Soloveitchik notes that this is not the Rambam's view. The phrasing of this halachah clearly implies that the Rambam does not consider the lack of proper intention when writing a Torah scroll sufficient to render it unacceptable. Thus, with regard to preparing the parchment, one is required to have the intent that it be used for the mitzvah, while that intent is not necessary when one is actually writing the scroll.</p>
<p>Rav Chayim differentiates between the two deeds as follows: Preparing the parchment is, in essence, a mundane act. Accordingly, the dimension of holiness that makes the parchment fit for use as a Torah scroll must be added by our intentions. In contrast, writing the scroll is, in essence, a holy act. Accordingly, there is no need for anything to be added by our intention."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.15",they are not acceptable. -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) states that one must make a verbal statement of this intention. If not, the Torah scroll is unacceptable. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (276:1) differs and states that while making a verbal statement is preferable, as long as one intended to write the name with the desired intent, the Torah scroll may be used. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:19) also states with regard to writing God's name in <i>tefillin</i>, that, if the scribe made a verbal statement that he is writing the Torah scroll for the desired pupose, after the fact, it is sufficient merely to have had the desired intent in mind when writing God's name without expressing it verbally."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.15",greets him. -," The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 276:4) rules that if the scribe does reply, the Torah scroll is not disqualified."

One of the opinions mentioned in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 22a explains that this calligraphy was indigenous to the Jews, and the Torah itself was originally written in it. It was, nevertheless, not used by the Jews for an extended period until after the Babylonian exile, when it became the standard calligraphy for sacred writings.</p>
<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yadayim</i> 4:5), the Rambam explains the latter opinion, stating that <i>Ashurit</i> means ""the finest and most choice."" This name was given to this calligraphy because:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">It is the most choice calligraphy. Its characters are not interchangeable... nor do they resemble each other to the extent that doubt might arise.... This does not apply with regard to other scripts.</p>
<p>It was adopted by the Jewish people in the Babylonian exile after the destruction of the First Temple. In previous (and subsequent) generations, Hebrew was generally written with other characters."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.19",in Greek as well. -," From the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Megillah</i> 1:8, 2:1, it appears that the intent is not to write a Greek transliteration of the Hebrew, but rather a translation. The Rambam explains that the Septuagint - the translation of the Torah into Greek at the order of King Ptolemy (<i>Megillah</i> 9a;<i>Soferim</i> 1:7) - had become popular. Hence, it was permitted to be used for a Torah scroll."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.19","Therefore, at present, all three sacred articles may be written using Assyrian script alone. -"," Significantly, however, in <i>Hilchot Megillah</i> 2:3, the Rambam does not state that Greek is unacceptable at present.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.19",Any letter that cannot be read by a child who is neither wise nor foolish -," This refers to a child who is able to recognize letters, but not words. Were he able to recognize words, one could assume that he might identify a letter, not by its shape, but because of the meaning of the word in which it is located (Rashi, <i>Menachot</i> 29b)."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.19","Therefore, one must be careful with regard to the form of the letters -"," This applies not only when the sacred article was originally written, but throughout the time it is being used. If a portion of a letter cracks, fades, is rubbed out, or is torn, in a manner which alters its form, the sacred article is unacceptable.</p>

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.20",[The following rules apply to] parchment which has holes: One should not write over a hole. -," Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 108a, associates this ruling with the interpretation, וכתב תם, quoted from <i>Shabbat</i> 103b above.

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.1,How many candles should one light on Chanukah? The -, minimal requirement to fulfill the
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.1,in each and every house -," Significantly, the mitzvah of lighting Chanukah candles is connected with an individual's home as well as with his person. Therefore, as mentioned in Halachah 11, a person who is a guest at the home of others need not share in the lighting of the candles if he knows that candles are being lit in his own home."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.1,A person who performs the mitzvah in a beautiful and conscientious manner should light candles for every member of the household -," <i>Shabbat</i> 21a.</p>
<p>From the Rambam's statements, it appears that the additional light is kindled by the master of of the household and not by each of the members of the household themselves. Even according to this interpretation, however, the custom of each child lighting Chanukah lights is valuable as an expression of <i>chinuch</i>, training them in the observance of the mitzvot."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.1,A person who is even more conscientious in his performance of the mitzvah than this and observes the mitzvah in the most desirable manner -, <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) describes such a person as <i>mehadrin min hamehadrin</i>.
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.4,When a candleholder has two openings -, and a wick is kindled in both of them
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.4,[The following rules apply when] one fills a bowl with oil and surrounds it with wicks: If one covers it with a utensil -," The flames from each of the lights will not merge together. Therefore,"
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.4,If one does not cover it with a utensil -," The flames from each of the lights may merge together as a single flame. Therefore,"
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.5,The Chanukah candles should not be kindled before sunset. -," Most commentaries interpret the Rambam's intent as the time when the sun disappears from the horizon. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 672:1) interpret ""sunset"" in this context as referring to the time when there is no sunlight visible - i.e., the appearance of three stars. Many of the later authorities, however, accept the Rambam's ruling. (See the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 672.)</p>
<p>The candles should not be lit before sunset, since their purpose is to publicize the Chanukah miracles. During the daytime, no one will notice them and this purpose will not be served."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.5,One should not light later -," At night, it is customary to kindle lights. Therefore, if a person lights the candles at this time, an onlooker may err and think that he is lighting for his own needs and not for the sake of the mitzvah. Nevertheless, on Saturday night, when there is no alternative, we light the candles after the appearance of the stars."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.5,"Should one forget, or even if one purposely did not light at sunset -", although the most appropriate time for fulfilling the mitzvah has passed
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.5,How long a duration of time is this? Approximately half an hour or slightly more than that. -," Thus, according to the Rambam, after half an hour past sunset, kindling the candles no longer fulfills a mitzvah. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 672:2) states that in the present age, since it is customary to light inside one's house (see Halachah 8 and commentary), the essential element of publicizing the Chanukah miracle is to involve one's own family in the candle lighting. Therefore, one fulfills the mitzvah as long as the members of one's household are awake.</p>
<p>The Ramah, nevertheless, counsels that at the outset, one should try to adhere to the stricter view. In light of these statements, the common practice of lighting the Chanukah candles well after nightfall should be examined. Is it correct to refrain willfully from fulfilling the mitzvah in the most desirable manner, and perhaps, according to the Rambam, not to fulfill it at all?"
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.5,One should place enough oil in the lamp -," When one lights the candles, they should have the amount of oil mentioned. It is improper to light with a smaller amount of oil and add more afterwards. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 675:2.)"
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.5,"If one lit it and it became extinguished, one need not light it a second time. -"," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 673:2) prefaces this law by stating the principle, ""kindling fulfills the mitzvah."" Although the Chanukah candles should burn for half an hour, one fulfills the mitzvah only when lighting them. Thus, one must light them in a manner that - barring any unexpected events - they will be able to burn for a half an hour - e.g., they must have a sufficient amount of oil to burn for that period and they must not be placed where they could be extinguished by the wind. Once a person has taken these precautions, however, he has no further obligation.</p>
<p>Note, however, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:27, which states that it is proper to relight the candles so that they will burn for the desired time."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.5,one may extinguish it or remove it -," While the candles are burning, however, they should not be moved. See also Halachah 9 and commentary."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.6,All oils and all wicks are acceptable for use in the Chanukah lamps -," This is a contrast to the Sabbath laws. As explained in Chapter 2 of the tractate of <i>Shabbat</i> and Chapter 5 of the Rambam's <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, there are certain oils and wicks that are unacceptable for use for the Sabbath candles."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.6,and even those wicks that do not hold the light well. -," Here also, these wicks were forbidden for use for the Sabbath candles lest one tilt the light.</p>
<p>Although all wicks are acceptable, it is customary to use wicks of flax or of cotton (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:2)."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.6,with oils and wicks that are forbidden to be used for the Sabbath lights. -," Needless to say, the prohibition against using these candles for the Sabbath lights still remains in effect."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.6,it is forbidden to use the Chanukah candles [for one's own purposes] -," During the week, this prohibition applies only during the first half hour that the candles are burning. Afterwards, their mitzvah is completed, as stated in the previous halachah."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.7,It is a mitzvah to place -," As is obvious from Halachah 9, the Chanukah lamp should be placed outside before being lit.</p>
<p>""IR1200<b>the Chanukah lamp at the outside of the entrance to one's home -</b> As mentioned previously, the mitzvah of lighting Chanukah candles was instituted for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle. Therefore, the candles should be placed at the outside of one's dwelling to attract the attention of the passersby in the public domain (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 21b).</p>
<p>In a spiritual sense, this points to the potential possessed by the Chanukah candles to spread light beyond the normal limits of holiness. Generally, mitzvot are performed within a home or synagogue. In this instance, the nature of the mitzvah is to spread light to the public domain, to illuminate the darkness of the world at large.</p>
<p>""IX <b>within the handbreadth that is closest to the doorway -</b> If the candelabrum were placed any further away, it would not be obvious that the owner of the home placed it there for the purpose of kindling Chanukah lights (<i>ibid.</i>)."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.7,so that the mezuzah will be on the right side -, as is required (see <i>Hilchot Mezuzah</i> 6:12)
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.7,When a person lives in a second storey apartment -," The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:5) qualifies this to mean a second storey apartment that does not have a private entrance to the public domain or a courtyard. If the apartment has such an entrance, the Chanukah lamp should be lit at that entrance."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.7,If [a person] places a Chanukah lamp more than twenty cubits -," a cubit is between 18 and 24 inches, according to the varying Rabbinic opinions. Thus the Rambam is speaking about a height between thirty and forty feet."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.8,"In a time of danger, a person may place a Chanukah lamp inside his house -"," <i>Shabbat</i> 21b mentions this leniency. According to <i>Tosafot</i>, the danger refers to the persecutions of the Jews of Babylon by the ruling Persians for lighting candles mentioned in <i>Shabbat</i> 45a. Needless to say, there have been countless other periods of persecution in Jewish history.</p>
<p>It is, however, significant that even in times when there was no obvious danger, the custom has been to light the Chanukah candles inside our homes. Even in the present day, when there is little danger of persecution in most places where Jews are located, it is not customary to light the Chanukah candles at the entrance to the home in most communities."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.8,"[Therefore,] another lamp must be burning in the house to provide light for one's [mundane] activities. -"," As mentioned in Halachah 6, it is forbidden to use the light of the Chanukah lamp for a mundane purpose. Since it is very likely that there will be some activity carried out in the house while the candles are burning, an additional light should be kindled. Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:14, which explains that the present custom is to kindle an additional light near the Chanukah candles, besides the light that is ordinarily burning in the room.</p>
<p>This light, called the <i>shamash</i>, should be placed apart from the Chanukah candles so that it can be distinguished from them (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 673:1). Often, many commercially produced Chanukah lamps fail to make a sufficient distinction between this candle and the Chanukah lights themselves."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.9,"A Chanukah lamp that was kindled by a deaf-mute, a mentally incapable person, a minor, or a gentile is of no consequence. -"," i.e., it does not constitute fulfillment of the mitzvah. All these four individuals are not obligated to fulfill mitzvot. Therefore, their kindling of the Chanukah lamp cannot fulfill the obligation instituted by our Sages.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Nissim mentions that a minor who is of the age when he is obligated to be trained in the fulfillment of the commandments may kindle the Chanukah lamps on behalf of the household. This opinion is not, however, accepted by other authorities, although they do mention that a child should be trained in the observance of the mitzvah of Chanukah candles as part of his process of education (<i>chinuch</i>).</p>
<p>Although the Rambam does not mention the latter concept explicitly, nevertheless, it is expected that he would agree. (See <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 11:10.)"
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.9,"Should the [Chanukah lamp] be kindled inside and then taken and placed at the entrance of one's home while it is still burning, it is of no consequence. -"," <i>Shabbat</i> 22b explains that even those opinions that do not accept the principle, ""Kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah and not placing it down,"" would accept this law, because it would appear that one is carrying the lamp as a torch and using it to light the way."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.9,If one held a candle and stood in one place -," The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 675:3 states that this restriction applies only when one holds the Chanukah lamp for the full half an hour that it is required to burn. If, however, one held it while lighting it and placed it down, one is considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah.</p>
<p>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 675:7, however, quotes other opinions, which do not accept this principle, and states that one should light the candles when the candelabrum is positioned in its place."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.9,since -, another factor is involved
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.9,"When a lamp was burning through the entire [Sabbath] day, one may extinguish the light -"," To fulfill the mitzvah for the present night, one must extinguish the light. The word ""may"" is used only because there is no obligation to kindle one's Chanukah lights in this manner."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.9,Kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah and not placing it down. -," <i>Shabbat</i> 23a derives this principle from the blessing we recite before lighting the candles, which mentions the commandment ""to kindle the Chanukah lights.""</p>
<p>There are two dimensions to every mitzvah: the performance of the deed itself (the <i>po'al</i>) - in this instance, the deed of kindling the Chanukah lights - and the effect of that performance (the <i>nif'al</i>), the fact that these lights are burning. This principle emphasizes that it is the kindling of the lights which is the focus of the mitzvah.</p>
<p>This is significant, for one might think that since the purpose of the mitzvah is <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, communicating the Chanukah miracles, what is most important is the fact that the lights are burning; how they are lit is of no consequence. This principle shows, however, that for <i>pirsumei nisa</i> to take place, the Chanukah lights must be kindled as prescribed by our Sages (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>)."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.10,When a courtyard has two entrances from two different directions -," Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 23a, clarifies that the entrances need not be on opposite sides, as long as they are different - e.g, north and east"
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.10,"[Were one to light at only one entrance,] the passersby from the other direction might say, ""A Chanukah light had not been placed down."" -"," At present, however, when it is customary to light inside one's home, it is sufficient even for a person with such a courtyard to kindle a single Chanukah lamp (Ramah, <i>loc. cit.</i>)."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.11,A guest -," i.e., a person who is not a permanent member of the household, even though he eats at the family table (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 677:4).</p>
<p><i>Shabbat</i> 23a, the source for this halachah, concerns itself with <i>yeshivah</i> students. Rabbi Zeira states, ""When we were students at the academy, I contributed pennies to my host's candles. After I took a wife, I said, 'This is not necessary.' The same laws, however, apply to other guests."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.11,"If, however, he has no home in which [Chanukah lights] are being kindled -"," The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 677:1 states that a person must be certain that his wife is lighting the candles at home. If the possibility exists that she will not do so, one should kindle Chanukah lights and recite a blessing."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.11,He should share -," He is not required to pay the cost of half the oil. It is sufficient for him to give a few pennies towards its cost (<i>Shabbat, loc. cit.; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 677:1)."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.11,If he is staying in a private dwelling -," more specifically, if the dwelling where he is staying has a private entrance (<i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>)"
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.11,even though [Chanukah lights] are being kindled for him at home -," and thus, he would ordinarily have no obligation to kindle these lights"
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.13,When a person has only a single prutah -," A <i>prutah</i> is worth .05 gram of silver, approximately 5-10 cents in today's currency. It is a significant commentary on the inflation in food costs to note that either a cup of wine or a measure of oil could be purchased for that amount."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.13,"and lighting the Chanukah lamp, he should give precedence to purchasing oil to kindle the Chanukah lamp over [purchasing] wine to recite kiddush. -"," In this instance, he should recite <i>kiddush</i> over bread, as stated in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:9. If a person has the choice between purchasing bread for his Sabbath meal or oil for his Chanukah lamp, the bread is given priority (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 678:4)."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.14,"If [a person has the opportunity to fulfill only one of two mitzvot,] lighting a lamp for one's home [i.e., Sabbath candles] -"," Perhaps the Rambam uses the expression ""lighting a lamp for one's home,"" rather than the expression ""the Sabbath lamp"" to emphasize that the focus is on how the Sabbath lamp leads to peace in the home."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.14,"the lamp for one's home receives priority, since it generates peace within the home. -"," <i>Shabbat</i> 23b associates the Sabbath candles with peace, explaining that they prevent the members of the household from stumbling over obstacles, and also allow them to avoid the discomfort of sitting in darkness.</p>
<p>Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:1, the Rambam mentions that the Sabbath candles contribute to the atmosphere of <i>oneg Shabbat</i>, Sabbath pleasure. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:5, he mentions them as being associated with activities carried out in honor of the Sabbath (<i>k'vod Shabbat</i>). In the laws of the Sabbath itself, the Rambam does not mention the connection between the Sabbath candles and peace within the home.</p>
<p>This relates to the concept mentioned previously, that the peace generated by the Sabbath candles relates to the Torah as a whole and not to the Sabbath in particular (<i>Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.</i>)."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.14,to create peace between a husband and his wife. -," The Rambam is referring to the process of testing a <i>sotah</i>, a woman suspected of committing adultery. A curse against her containing God's name is written on a scroll. The text is rubbed out in water, and the water is given to the woman to drink. If she indeed committed adultery, she will die. (See <a href=""/9933#v11"">Numbers 5:11</a>-31; <i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 3:8-10.)"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.1,"the Holy One, blessed be He, does not reject the prayers of the many. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 8a cites <a href=""/16276#v19"">Psalms 55:19</a>: ""He delivered my soul in peace from the battle against me, for there were many who strove with me,"" as the prooftext for this concept."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.1,and should not pray alone whenever he is able to pray with the community. -," i.e., though praying without a <i>minyan</i> is permissible, one should do so only when he has no other alternative.</p>
<p>One should always spend the early morning and evening [hours] in the synagogue - i.e., one should be found in the synagogue at the times of the three Daily Prayers; <i>Shacharit</i> in the morning, <i>Minchah</i> in the late afternoon and <i>Maariv</i> at night.</p>
<p>The Rambam uses the word ישכים - to rise early. Perhaps he is alluding to <i>Berachot</i> 47b which states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">One should always rise early and go to the synagogue in order to merit being counted among the first ten present. Even if 100 people come after him, he receives the reward of all of them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps he is referring to his statement, <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:11, that one should recite the <i>Shema</i> before sunrise."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.1,at all times -," The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains: Prayer which is recited with the proper intentions outside the synagogue may be accepted, but there is no guarantee that prayer will be accepted at all times..."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.2,"It is a mitzvah to run to the synagogue as [<a href=""/16160#v3"">Hoshea 6:3</a>] states: ""Let us know. Let us run to know God."" -", The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) adds that it is also a mitzvah to run to perform other commandments.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.2,"When one enters a synagogue he should go in the distance of two doorways and then pray, -"," Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 8a) explains that we are obligated to enter the distance of two doorways widthwise in order not to appear anxious to leave. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) explains that this refers to a distance of eight handbreadths.</p>
<p>The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> interprets the Talmud's statement, ""the measure of two doorways"" as a matter of time, not distance. One should wait a few moments after entering the synagogue before he starts to pray.</p>
<p>The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> also states that according to the interpretation that the ""measure of two doorways"" refers to actual distance, this requirement only applies when the synagogue is located near the public thoroughfare. If it is not, one may pray near the door. Rabbenu Yonah also mentions that a person whose fixed place for prayer in the synagogue is beside the door does not violate this requirement. It is obvious that he is sitting there not because of his desire to leave quickly, but because it is his seat in the synagogue."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.3,A study hall is greater -," i.e., it is a more auspicious place to pray."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.3,"Even though [some of the] great Sages [lived in] cities where many synagogues were located, they would pray only in the place where they studied Torah. -"," <i>Berachot</i> 30b relates: ""Even though there were thirteen synagogues in Tiberias, Rav Ami and Rav Assi would pray only between the pillars in the study hall.""</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 8a interprets the phrase ""the gates of Zion"" in <a href=""/16308#v2"">Psalms 87:2</a>: ""God loves the gates of Zion above all the dwellings of Jacob"" as referring to ""the gates of those who are בהלכה המצויינים (distinguished by the halachah studied there)"" and states that they receive the highest degree of Divine attention.</p>
<p>The Talmud continues: Abbaye says: ""Originally, I would study in my house and pray in the synagogue. After hearing this, I pray only where I study."""
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.4,"What is implied by [the term,] communal prayer? One [person] prays aloud and all [the others] listen. -"," With this statement, the Rambam touches on a point debated both by the Sages of the Talmud and the later Rabbis. The mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 33b, states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Just as the leader of the congregation is obligated [to pray], each individual is obligated. Rabban Gamliel states: ""The leader of the congregation fulfills the obligation on behalf of the community.""</p>
<p>The Talmud (34b) elaborates on the difference of opinion:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">They asked Rabban Gamliel: ""According to your opinion, why does the community pray?""<br/>
He replied: ""In order to allow the leader of the community to prepare his prayers.""<br/>
Rabban Gamliel asked them: ""According to your opinion, why does the leader of the congregation pray aloud?""<br/>
They replied: ""In order to allow those who are not knowledgeable to fulfill their obligation.""<br/>
He told them: ""Just as he fulfills the obligation on behalf of those who are not knowledgeable, he fulfills it on behalf of those who are knowledgeable.""</p>
<p>The Sages of the Talmud continued to debate the issue. The ultimate decision accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, the Rambam (See Halachah 9), and Rabbenu Asher, is that during the entire year, the Sages' opinion is accepted. However, on Rosh HaShanah, because of the complexity of the blessings (See Halachah 10), Rabban Gamliel's opinion prevails.</p>
<p>Both Rabban Gamliel and the Sages agree that the practice of communal prayer involves two elements:<br/>
a) the silent prayers of many individuals; and<br/>
b) the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br/>
They differ, however, as to which of these elements is considered of primary importance. According to the Sages, the essential element of communal prayer is that ten or more people recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the same time. According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.</p>
<p>[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]</p>
<p>The Rambam's statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.</p>
<p>In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam's statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan's</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9). By doing so, one will have both the advantages of individual and communal prayer."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.4,adult -," Males who have reached the age of thirteen years and a day and manifested signs of physical maturity. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:19.)</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this halachah from <i>Berachot</i> 47b-48a which allows for the inclusion of a child in the <i>zimmun</i> for the grace after meals. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:7.) We assume that this leniency was granted only in regard to grace, but not in regard to prayer. See also <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 91:3.</p>
<p>Many Halachic authorities do not accept this conclusion. In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon rules that a child may be counted as the tenth in a <i>minyan</i>. Similarly, the <i>Ba'al HaMe'or</i> holds that even up to four minors may be counted in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted. There are opinions that in such a case, the minor must be at least six years old, understand that prayer is service to God, and hold a <i>chumash</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 55:5, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 55:5)."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.4,The leader of the congregation is [counted as] one of them. -," Though there is no explicit source to this effect, a number of midrashim (e.g., <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 23:4) lead to this conclusion.</p>
<p>One of the communal rites listed in <i>Megillah</i> 23b which requires a <i>minyan</i> is ברכת אבלים - the blessing one utters to those in mourning. For the recitation of that blessing, the presence of ten men other than the mourner himself is required. (See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 13:1.) Perhaps the Rambam feels that this statement is necessary to clearly distinguish between the different requirements of a <i>minyan</i> for prayer and ברכת אבלים."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.4,provided the majority of the ten have not prayed. -<i>Soferim</i> 10:7 states:<br/>,"</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Our Sages in the West say [that <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>barchu</i> may be recited] even with seven. They explain their position [based on <a href=""/15813#v2"">Judges 5:2</a>]: ""In the time of tumult in Israel when the people volunteered themselves, blessed be God."" [The number of people correspond] to the number of words [in the verse which describes the blessing of God].<br/>
There are those who say only six [are required], since ברכו is the sixth word [of the above verse].</p>
<p>The Rambam differentiates between the ruling regarding prayer and his statements in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:8 where he writes that it is necessary that seven people out of ten eat bread in order to constitute a <i>minyan</i> for <i>zimmun</i>, for ""a noticeable majority"" is required.</p>
<p>There are two views quoted in the name of Rabbenu Tam (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> 23b); one, requiring a minimum of seven people who have not prayed for a <i>minyan</i> just as seven who have eaten bread are required for a <i>minyan</i> in regard to grace after meals and, another, requiring, only five. However, the Rambam's opinion is universally accepted as halachah.</p>
<p>Similarly, we should not recite Kedushah, - See Chapter 7, Halachah 17.</p>
<p>In the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is customary to recite three verses in the <i>Kedushah</i>:<br/>
a) ""Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the entire earth is full of His glory"" (<a href=""/15937#v3"">Isaiah 6:3)</a>;<br/>

<p>The commentaries debate the definition of <i>Kedushah</i> and therefore, question which passage the Rambam requires to be omitted when one prays alone. The Rambam's statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, appear to define <i>Kedushah</i> as only the first of these three verses."

However, note one of the Rambam's responsa which states that, on Sabbaths and festivals, rather than begin with silent prayer, the <i>chazan</i> should begin by reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> out loud together with <i>Kedushah</i>. Those who do not know how to pray should listen to his prayers with the intention of fulfilling their obligation. Those who know how to pray should recite their prayers, word by word, together with the <i>chazan</i>."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.11,Only a person of great stature within the community in both wisdom -, Torah knowledge
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.11,should be appointed -, The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> mentions that this applies only to the appointment of a permanent <i>chazan</i> and does not apply to someone who leads the congregation in prayer on occasion. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 53:6) mentions this in regard to a <i>chazan</i> having a full beard.
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.11,"If he is an older man, -"," Though the Hebrew, זקן, is often used to connote a wise man (See <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 6:1), this translation has been chosen based on the later statements of this halachah."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.11,"to appoint as the leader of the congregation, someone who has a pleasant voice -"," so that listening to his prayers will be enjoyable.</p>
<p>Throughout the generations, in their responsa, our Rabbis have chided the people for putting a pleasant voice at the top of their priorities for a <i>chazan</i>. [Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 53:5) who states that it is preferable to appoint a boy of thirteen who understands his prayers as <i>chazan</i> rather than an older man with a pleasant voice who does not know what he is saying. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 53:11).]</p>
<p>In particular, this applies regarding the High Holiday services. These days of sincere prayer should not be turned into concerts of ritual music. Instead, attempts should be made to find a <i>chazan</i> who can truly serve as a spiritual leader. If he also has a pleasant voice, it is obviously more desirable."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.11,A person who does not have a full beard -," The Rabbis have explained that this simply refers to a person of intermediate age. Therefore, in one of his responsa, the Rambam states that a person who is physically incapable of growing a beard may serve as <i>chazan</i> and the requirement of a beard is only mentioned as a sign of ""a full state of knowledge which one [usually] reaches at the age when one's beard begins to grow."" See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 53:8).</p>
<p>However, a beard is also considered a sign of commitment to Jewish practice. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 12:7) associates shaving with the practices of gentile priests. Many Rabbis have strongly encouraged growing a beard even when there is no question of violating the prohibition against shaving. (See <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> 7, <i>Shibolei Leket</i> Vol. II, 41.)</p>
<p>However, in communities where removing one's facial hair in a permitted manner is an accepted practice, the lack of a beard is not considered as a deterrent against a person serving as a <i>chazan</i>."

Rashi explains that such mispronunciations will cause blessings to be read as curses. For example, if the word, יאר, the first word of the second priestly blessing, פניו אליך ‘ה יאר, is read with an ע instead of an א, it becomes a curse."

There is an added undesirable factor in eating matzah in this manner. Preferably, no other substances should be eaten with the matzah, so that only its taste will be sensed. (Indeed, were he to chew both the matzah and the maror, he would not fulfill his obligation (See <i>Pesachim</i> 115a). To insure that nothing negate the taste of the matzah, in many communities it is customary not to dip the matzah in salt when eating it at the seder)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.2,If he wrapped them in fibers or the like and swallowed them --," the matzah, maror, and fibers"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.3,A person who eats matzah without the intention [to fulfill the mitzvah] --," This halachah touches on a question left unresolved by the Talmud (see <i>Pesachim</i> 114b), and which has become a source of debate and discussion among the Rabbis in subsequent generations. Does a person who performs the deed of a mitzvah, without the intention to carry out God's command, fulfill his obligation, or not?"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.3,fulfills his obligation --," It appears that the Rambam does not require a person to have the intention to fulfill a mitzvah, for in this instance the only reason the person ate the matzah was the coercion of the gentiles. Nevertheless, the commentaries qualify the Rambam's statements, based on <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person who occupies himself with blowing shofar to learn does not fulfill his obligation... one does not fulfill his obligation until both the person hearing [the shofar] and the one sounding it intend to fulfill the obligation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In resolution, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage from <i>Keritot</i> 19b.</p>
<p>Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only מתעסק (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the present context, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him. In contrast, since his body did not benefit from hearing the shofar, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears the shofar blown in the proper manner.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 475:4) quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> opinion as regards <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> adds the explanation mentioned in the name of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. (It must be noted that the <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries do not accept this decision). In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 589:8, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes the Rambam's decision concerning blowing the shofar, stating that a מתעסק does not fulfill the mitzvah. Similar decisions are rendered concerning <i>kriat shema</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60) and lulav and etrog (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651)."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.3,is obligated to eat another [, כזית] — to fulfill the mitzvah because
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.4,A person does not fulfill the obligation of eating matzah unless he partakes [of matzah made] from one of the five species --," wheat, rye, barley, oats, and spelt, as stated in Halachah 5:1."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.4,"as [<a href=""/9980#v3"">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>] --"," In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 1:2), the Rambam cites two verses while explaining this principle: <a href=""/9873#v18"">Exodus 12:18</a>, ""in the evening, you shall eat matzot"" and the verse cited here. Similarly, certain manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> contain both verses. The fact that the mitzvah to eat matzah is derived from the verse in Exodus and not the verse in Deuteronomy tends to support the text which quotes both verses. However, <i>Pesachim</i> 35a, the source for the exegesis of this verse, only mentions one verse."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.4,may be eaten as matzah to fulfill one's obligation --," as evident from the following halachah, the actual dough used to make the matzah need not have the potential to become leavened. However, the species of grain used as flour must be fit to become leavened. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, Halachah 5.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.5,A person who makes dough from wheat and rice --, combining the two species in one matzah

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.5,"However, [the dough] should not be kneaded with wine, oil, honey, or milk, because of the requirement for poor man's bread, as explained above --"," in Halachah 5:20. There is a slight difficulty with this statement. The halachah cited states that only water should be used for the matzah. The Radbaz (Vol. III, Responsum 1074) states that only the four liquids mentioned here may not be used, for only they change the taste of the matzah appreciably. However, the Ra'avad and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:1) forbid the use of matzah made with any liquid other than water for use at the seder."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.5,One cannot fulfill his obligation with matzah made from thin bran or coarse --," as mentioned above, there is a debate among the Rabbis which Hebrew term is appropriate to which type of bran."

Similarly, Rabbenu Manoach mentions matzah dipped in wine. Nevertheless, the Ra'avad and others maintain that other foods would nullify the taste of matzah, and they permit soaking the matzah only in water. They draw support from the Rambam's statements in Halachah 10 and maintain that he also accepts this restriction.</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> and the other Ashkenazic authorities favor the latter opinion. However, they do maintain that a sick person who could not eat a sufficient quantity of matzah soaked in water may soak his matzah in wine."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.6,"However, a person cannot fulfill his obligation with matzah that has been cooked --"," even if cooked in water alone,"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.7,"A person cannot fulfill his obligation by eating matzah which is forbidden to him; for example, a person who ate [matzah made from] tevel --"," produce from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> from which the agricultural requirements — separation of the <i>terumah</i> (a portion given to priests), <i>ma'aser rishon</i> (the first tithe), and <i>ma'aser sheni</i> (the second tithe) — have not been fulfilled."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.7,or [matzah] that was stolen --," The Jerusalem Talmud, Challah 1:9, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matzah that was stolen: one may not recite a blessing upon it. Rav Oshiah states: This is derived from <a href=""/16231#v3"">Psalms 10:3</a>: ""The greedy's blessing revolts God.""</p>
<p>However, one might think this is true only in the beginning; ultimately (i.e., after eating the matzah), he is obligated to pay him money (and thus the matzah itself is no longer the property of the original owner.)</p>
<p>Rabbi Yochanan states: ""A mitzvah is not a sin."" Rabbi Yossi states: ""A sin is not a mitzvah."" Rabbi Illa said: ""Only when the mitzvot are performed as prescribed are they mitzvot.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 454:4) quotes the Rambam's statements exactly. Nevertheless, Rabbi Akiva Eiger maintains that since the stolen object no longer belongs to the original owners once it has been eaten, one may fulfill the mitzvah of matzah in this manner. All authorities agree that a person who stole grain or flour can fulfill his obligation with matzah made from it.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach maintains that this instance is not dependent on the general rulings governing mitzvot performed with forbidden objects. Rather, <i>Pesachim</i> 38a draws an analogy between the mitzvot of matzah and Challah. Since there is an explicit teaching requiring a person to own the dough he uses for Challah, it thus follows that the matzah he uses must also be his undisputed property."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.7,may be used to fulfill one's obligation --, to eat matzah on Pesach.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.8,The priests --, and their households
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.8,or terumah --," <a href=""/9943#v19"">Numbers 15:19</a>, 18:12 commands that before tithes are given to the Levites, a certain portion of the grain should be separated and given to the priests. This portion, referred to as <i>terumah</i>, may be eaten only by the priests and their households."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.8,"Similarly, a person may fulfill his obligation with matzah","</p>
<p>[made] from ma'aser sheni — <a href=""/9978#v22"">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>-23 commands: ""Take a [second] tithe of all the crops... You must eat this before God, your Lord, in the place that He will choose (Jerusalem)."""

<p>Thus the actual produce separated as <i>ma'aser sheni</i> need not be taken to Jerusalem, but may be eaten elsewhere."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.9,Loaves from the thanksgiving offering --," as explained in <a href=""/9908#v12"">Leviticus 7:12</a> and commentaries, the thanksgiving offering was accompanied by forty loaves of bread. Thirty were matzah, and thus were kosher for use on Pesach."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.9,is also watched with the intention of [being used for a] sacrifice --," Hence, it may not be used to fulfill the mitzvah of matzah."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.9,that were made to be sold in the marketplace --, for others to use

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.10,A minor old enough to eat bread] should be trained in [the fulfillment of] mitzvot --," From the Rambam's phraseology, we learn that the mitzvah of training one's children to fulfill mitzvot is incumbent upon the parents. Neither the Torah nor the Sages placed any responsibilities on the children themselves. Rather, the parents are charged with teaching their children to follow the Torah's guidelines (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)."

However, matzah that is made with wine, oil, or honey may not be used to fulfill the mitzvah, and hence may be eaten at this time. (As mentioned above, such matzah is generally not eaten in the Ashkenazic community.)"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.12,in order for there to be a distinction between [partaking of it as food] and eating it on the evening [of the fifteen as a mitzvah.] --, The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pesachim</i> 10:1) states that a person who eats matzah on the day before Pesach can be compared to a man who has relations with his betrothed in her father's house before the wedding.
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.12,until his soul expires --," This phrase has provoked much controversy among the commentators. The Tashbaytz (Vol. II, Responsum 51) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a wondrous statement... If the intention is that after he eats, he should be beaten... a Rabbinic prohibition will be punished more severely than a Torah prohibition... for such a penalty is not found with regard to a Torah prohibition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, some commentaries advise striking this phrase from the text, maintaining that it was a later addition which was not made by the Rambam himself. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Manoach justifies this phrase, explaining that it refers to a situation where a person obstinately refuses to accept the prohibition. As long as he does not promise to obey the Sages' decree, the authorities must continue administering punishment."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.1",Everyone is obligated to hear -," Though the Rambam's statements are based on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a, he makes a slight emendation, adding the expression ""to hear,"" in order to emphasize that the mitzvah is hearing, not blowing, the shofar."

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.1",A person who is half slave and half free -," In <i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 7:4, the Rambam explains that a slave can reach this status in one of three ways:</p>

<p>c) a slave belonged to two masters; one freed him and one did not.</p>

<p>Such a slave is considered as having two different natures included in the same person. Thus, the aspect of him which is a free man is obligated to hear the shofar, and the aspect which is a slave is not. See also Halachah 3."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.1",and an androgynous -," a term borrowed from the Greek, in which <i>andro</i> means ""man,"" and <i>gynous</i> ""woman."" It refers to person who has both male and female sexual organs. The Sages were unsure whether to consider such a person a male or a female. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:24 and also the commentary on the following halachah.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.2",Whoever is not [himself] obligated regarding this matter -," i.e., those mentioned in the previous halachah, a שוטה (a mentally unstable individual) and a חרש (a deaf person). In contrast, a blind person is obligated to hear the shofar."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.2",for one who is obligated. -," However, a male who has already fulfilled his obligation to hear the shofar can blow the shofar for a colleague (Rabbenu Manoach)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.2","An androgynous can facilitate the performance of the mitzvah for one of his kind, -"," i.e., another <i>androgynous</i>"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.2","A tumtum cannot facilitate the performance of the mitzvah [for anyone], whether of his kind or not of his kind, for -"," in his case, the doubt is not about the general category, but an individual question about the particular <i>tumtum's</i> nature"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.3",A person who is half slave and half free cannot even facilitate the performance of the mitzvah -, by blowing the shofar
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.3",because the aspect of himself which is a slave cannot facilitate the performance of the mitzvah for the aspect of himself which is free. -," Every activity performed by such an individual is considered as a combined effort carried out by both aspects of his being. The aspect of his being which is a free man is obligated to hear shofar blown by one who is obligated to perform the mitzvah. Hence, the <i>teki'ot</i> he blows himself include the influence of his slave side, and are not sufficient to facilitate his performance of the mitzvah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.4",A person who occupies himself with blowing the shofar in order to learn -, without the intention of fulfilling the mitzvah of hearing the shofar
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.4",from a person who blows it casually -, without the intention of facilitating his colleague's performance of the mitzvah
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.4","If the person hearing had the intention of fulfilling his obligation, but the person blowing did not have the intention of facilitating the latter's performance of the mitzvah -"," <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28b quotes Rabbi Zeira as instructing Shamaya: ""Have me in mind and blow for me."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.4","Rather, both the person hearing and the one allowing him to hear -"," i.e., the person blowing the shofar"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.5",If a person blew the shofar with the intention of enabling all those hearing his blowing to perform the mitzvah -," The blower need not have each individual in mind. However, as the previous halachah states, he must have the intention that his blowing enable people to fulfill their obligation to hear shofar. If he blows without that intention, their listening is of no consequence."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.5","even though the person blowing did not have a specific intention that this individual would hear his blowing, nor did he know about him - the listener has fulfilled his obligation, because the blower had in mind all those who heard him. -", <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a derives this principle by contrasting the law mentioned in the previous halachah with the law mentioned in this halachah's latter clause.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.6",If the festival of Rosh Hashanah falls on the Sabbath -," According to the fixed calendar we use, Rosh Hashanah never falls on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday (<i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 7:1). Thus, the second day of Rosh Hashanah will never fall on the Sabbath. However, it is not at all infrequent for the first day of Rosh Hashanah to fall on the Sabbath."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.6",[This law was enacted] even though blowing [the shofar] was forbidden only as sh'vut. -," See the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4 for a definition of the term <i>sh'vut</i>. <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b equates the blowing of the shofar with removing bread from the oven. It appears from <i>Shabbat</i> 117b that the removal of bread from the oven was forbidden only because it is ""a weekday act,"" not in the spirit of the Sabbath. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 588:4.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.6","If so, why is the shofar not sounded? Because of a decree [of the Sages] lest a person take it in his hands and carry it to a colleague so that the latter can blow for him -"," The Rambam alters the expression used by <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b, which states: ""perhaps he will take it to a skilled person so that the latter will teach him."" Perhaps, the emendation was made because it is more likely that a person would desire that his colleague blow for him than begin to teach him on Rosh Hashanah itself."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.6",and thus violate a prohibition punishable by being stoned to death -, as is the commission of all Shabbat <i>melachot</i> (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 1:1-2.)
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.7",Children who have not reached an age at which they can be educated -, Rabbenu Manoach explains that this refers to children of six or seven.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.7","which is not the festival of Rosh Hashanah, so that they will learn [to blow]. -"," This halachah is not directly related to the laws of Rosh Hashanah, but rather to the laws of the Sabbath. If a child has not reached the age where he can be educated concerning the mitzvot, his parents are not required to prevent him from violating any of the mitzvot (<i>Yevamot</i> 114a).</p>
<p>The law stated here represents a reversal of the Rambam's understanding of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33a from that in his commentary on the Mishnah. Indeed, his change in interpretation caused the Ra'avad to object to this halachah. It is interesting to note that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:9) and the primary interpretation mentioned in the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif) - sources which the Rambam relies upon heavily - follow the Rambam's initial approach."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.7",in the blowing of shofar] on the festival. -, even though the blowing of the shofar is prohibited on the Sabbath.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.8","When [the Sages] decreed not to sound [the shofar] on the Sabbath, they applied that decree only to places which lacked a court. -"," The Sages forbade sounding the shofar on the Sabbath lest someone carry it in a forbidden manner, as explained in the previous halachah. However, that decree was not applied to places where the Sanhedrin, Israel's supreme court, held its sessions. The influence of the court would be felt throughout the entire city and its surroundings. Hence, the people would be more scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot. (See the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:1 and the following halachah.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.8",everyone -," i.e., not only was the shofar sounded at the seat of the Sanhedrin and on the Temple mount, but throughout the city; even private individuals were allowed to blow the shofar (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 30a)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.8",[This did not apply] to the people of Jerusalem alone. -, The influence of the Sanhedrin could be felt even on the outskirts of the city.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.8",of Jerusalem -, There were a number of smaller villages surrounding Jerusalem which met all the requirements specified below.
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.8","hear the shofar blown in Jerusalem - i.e., excluding those on the mountaintops -"," Since they were situated on the mountaintops, they could see the city even from afar. However, the sound would not carry that far."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.8",from the city -," The exclusions mentioned by the Rambam are quoted from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid., based on the text of the Mishnah. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:1) interprets the Mishnah slightly differently."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.9","At present, while the Temple is destroyed, wherever a court whose judges received semichah -"," <i>Semichah</i> is the term used to refer to the permission granted to a judge to act in that capacity. Only a judge who himself possesses <i>semichah</i> can convey this distinction to a colleague. Moses gave Joshua and the seventy elders <i>semichah</i>, and they began a chain that stretched over many generations, ending several hundred years after the destruction of the Temple. (See <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 4:1-2.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.9",permanently holds sessions -," i.e., if, on Rosh Hashanah, the court held special sessions in a city where it was not normally located, the shofar would not be sounded. (See the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:1.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.9","Furthermore, the shofar is sounded on the Sabbath only in a court that has sanctified the new moon. -"," Originally, the months were sanctified by the courts after hearing the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon. (See <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i>, Chapters 1 and 2.)"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.9","Also, the shofar is sounded only in the presence of a high court -"," Our translation of בית דין גדול is based on the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who explains that in this context the term refers to an established court of judges with <i>semichah</i>, and not the Supreme Sanhedrin, as is sometimes the case. Indeed, authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from Yemen omit the word גדול from the above expression."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.9",Even after they -, the judges
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.9","However, outside the court, the shofar may not be sounded. -"," In this aspect, there was a difference between the sounding of the shofar on the Sabbath between Jerusalem and Yavneh. In Jerusalem, the influence of the Temple and the court was felt so strongly that even outside the presence of the court, the shofar could be sounded. In contrast, in Yavneh and other cities where courts were located, the shofar was sounded only in the presence of a court (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.)."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.10","In the present age, when we celebrate Rosh Hashanah in the exile for two days -", There is a slight imprecision with the Rambam's statements. Rosh Hashanah was celebrated for two days throughout almost the totality of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> even while the Temple was standing. It was impossible to notify the people in most of the land (for the messengers were not allowed to travel more than two thousand cubits beyond Jerusalem) whether or not the court had substantiated the testimony of the witnesses on the day when Rosh Hashanah was expected to fall. (See <i>Beitzah</i> 4b-5a; <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 5:7-8.)
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.10",If the first day -," As mentioned above, according to the fixed calendar which we employ at present, it is impossible for the second day of Rosh Hashanah to fall on the Sabbath."
Fasts 5.1,There are days when the entire Jewish people -, All healthy adult men and women
Fasts 5.1,because of the calamities that occurred to them then -," Here, the Rambam employs the same principle he developed at the beginning of this text regarding fasts instituted because of difficulties of an immediate nature, with regard to these fasts which were instituted for these national calamities.</p>
<p>Fasting in and of itself is not a purpose. Fasting can, however, serve"
Fasts 5.1,"This will serve as a reminder of our wicked conduct and that of our ancestors, which resembles our present conduct and therefore brought these calamities upon them and upon us. -"," Although these tragedies took place in previous generations, we share the responsibility for them. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 1:1) states, ""Every generation in which the Temple is not rebuilt should consider it as if it was destroyed in its days."""
Fasts 5.2,These days are the following: -," The Rambam lists these fasts, not in the order in which the events which they commemorate transpired, nor according to the order in which they are mentioned in <a href=""/16212#v19"">Zechariah 8:19</a> (see Halachah 4), but rather in the order of the year, beginning from the month of Tishrei."
Fasts 5.2,was slain -," According to the Radak (<a href=""/16038#v1"">Jeremiah 41:1)</a>, Gedaliah was slain on Rosh HaShanah. Because a fast could not be held on that sacred day, the commemoration of his murder was postponed until the first available weekday."
Fasts 5.2,"The Tenth of Tevet. This is the day Nebuchadnezzar, the wicked, the King of Babylon, camped -"," The Hebrew term םמך, which the Rambam [and the prophet <a href=""/16122#v2"">Ezekiel (24:2)</a>] employ, usually has a positive connotation, meaning ""support."" Perhaps this is also an allusion to the concept that ultimately these commemorative fasts have a positive intent, as mentioned at the conclusion of the chapter."
Fasts 5.2,The Seventeenth of Tammuz. Five tragedies took place on this day -," <i>Ta'anit</i> 29a states: Undesirable events are gathered together on a day appropriate for them. The spiritual nature of the day is such, that the potential for such tragedies to occur is greater."
Fasts 5.2,"b) In the First Temple, the offering of the daily sacrifices -"," The <i>korban tamid</i> (<a href=""/9956#v1"">Numbers 28:1</a>-8)"
Fasts 5.2,c) [The walls of] Jerusalem were breached in [the war leading to] the destruction of the Second Temple; -," <a href=""/16036#v2"">Jeremiah 39:2</a> states that in the destruction of the First Temple, Jerusalem's walls fell to the Babylonian conquerors on the ninth of Tammuz. Nevertheless, it is the destruction of the city by the Romans that we commemorate by fasting, because the effects of that destruction are more severe (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 549:2). The Rabbis did not institute a fast for the Ninth of Tammuz as well, for it was felt that this would be an excessive burden for the people (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 549:4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:8, because of the many difficulties suffered by the Jewish people, they miscalculated the date, and, even during the destruction of the First Temple, it was on the Seventeenth of Tammuz that Jerusalem's walls were breached."
Fasts 5.2,burned a Torah scroll -," The Meiri identifies this as the Torah scroll written by Ezra the Scribe. This scroll was kept in the Temple Courtyard and was used to check the precision of the other scrolls. In this manner, he attempted to undermine the entire Torah tradition."
Fasts 5.3,"On the Ninth of Av, five tragedies occurred -"," Here, also, we see the reflection of the concept mentioned above, that undesirable events are gathered together on a day appropriate for them."
Fasts 5.3,The First and the Second Temples were destroyed -," <i>Ta'anit</i> 29a reconciles a seeming contradiction in chronology between <a href=""/15931#v8"">II Kings 25:8</a>-9 and <a href=""/16049#v12"">Jeremiah 52:12</a>-13, explaining that the Babylonians first entered the Temple on the seventh of Av. They reveled and wrought havoc there until the afternoon of the ninth of Av, when they set fire to the building. The fire continued burning throughout the tenth of Av.</p>
<p>The Sages (<i>ibid.</i>) do not cite a specific source for the tradition that the Second Temple was also destroyed on that day. Nevertheless, the tradition is universally accepted."
Fasts 5.3,They were ruled by a great king whom the entire Jewish people and the leading Sages considered to be the Messianic king. -," See the Rambam's comments concerning Bar Kochva, <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 11:3."
Fasts 5.3,"On that day designated for retribution, the wicked Tineius Rufus -", a Roman officer
Fasts 5.5,And the entire Jewish people follow the custom of fasting at these times and on the Thirteenth of Adar -," The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this phrase to mean that our obligation to fast on these days is a custom accepted by the Jewish people after the destruction of the Second Temple. As mentioned above, others interpret this obligation as stemming from the exegesis of the verse from Zechariah mentioned in the previous halachah, as found in <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 18b.</p>
<p>Our translation follows the standard published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. Many authoritative manuscripts make a small change in the wording, which would cause the lines to be rendered as: ""And in these times, the entire Jewish people follow the custom of fasting on the Thirteenth of Adar."""
Fasts 5.5,"as mentioned [in <a href=""/16482#v31"">Esther 9:31</a>]: ""the matter of the fasts and the outcries."" -"," The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 141:2 writes that the commemoration of this fast makes us conscious of how God ""hears each person's prayer in his time of distress when he fasts and repents... as He did on behalf of our ancestors in those days.""</p>
<p>The fast of the Thirteenth of Adar is also referred to as <i>Ta'anit Esther</i>, ""the fast of Esther.""</p>
<p>When the fast of Esther became a formal part of Jewish observance is a matter of question. It is not mentioned in the Talmud. Furthermore, <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i>, a text which mentions all the fasts and festivals observed in the Talmudic era, does not mention this fast and speaks of the thirteenth of Adar, the day on which the fast of Esther is observed, as a day of celebration, the Day of Nicanor, marking the defeat of the Greek general of that name in the Hasmonean wars. It was not until after the destruction of the Temple that the observance of the dates mentioned in <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i> was nullified. This would appear to indicate that the observance of the Fast of Esther was of later origin.</p>
<p>In contrast, there is evidence pointing to the establishment of the Fast of Esther early in the Talmudic period. The <i>Sheiltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon, <i>Parshat Vayakhel</i> 67, speak of the observance of the Fast of Esther in the time of the Mishnah. Even if this teaching is not accepted as historical fact, we can glean from it that in Rav Achai's time, shortly after the conclusion of the Talmud, the fast was already a long-standing custom.</p>
<p>Significantly, because of the difference in status between it and the other commemorative fasts, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 686:2) rules far more leniently in regard to this fast than in regard to the others."
Fasts 5.5,"and held on Thursday, which is the eleventh of Adar. -"," As the Rambam mentions, if the date of a commemorative fast falls on Friday, the fast is held on that day. Nevertheless, it is improper for a fast that is not scheduled for such a day to be held then, since this is not proper reverence for the Sabbath (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>)."
Fasts 5.5,"If [the dates of] these fasts fall on Friday, we should fast on Friday. -"," According to the fixed calendar we follow at present, this is a rare occurrence. Only the Tenth of Tevet (in the northern hemisphere a relatively short fast) can fall on Friday. Even this does not happen frequently."
Fasts 5.5,The passage Vay'chal -," beginning <a href=""/9893#v11"">Exodus 32:11</a>."
Fasts 5.6,When the month of Av enters -," Significantly, the Rambam does not mention any restrictions from the period beginning the Seventeenth of Tammuz. During this period, it is the Askenazic custom (see Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 551:2,4; <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 122:1-3) to observe certain restrictions - e.g., prohibitions against marrying, against reciting the blessing <i>Shehecheyanu</i>, and against cutting one's hair. From the beginning of Av, however, other restrictions are also added."
Fasts 5.6,During the week of Tish'ah B'Av -," from the Sabbath before the fast onward.</p>
<p>According to Ashkenazic custom, all the activities mentioned by the Rambam are forbidden from Rosh Chodesh Av onward."
Fasts 5.6,to do laundry -," it is customary to observe this prohibition even if one does not intend to wear the garment until after the fast (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 551:3)."
Fasts 5.6,even one of linen -," Linen garments will not appear as distinguished after washing as those of other fabrics (<i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 551)."
Fasts 5.6,It has already been accepted as a Jewish custom not to eat meat -," or fowl. <i>Bava Batra</i> 60b states that it would have been proper for the Jews to refrain from eating meat and drinking wine at all times in mourning over the loss of the opportunity to partake of the sacrificial meat and the loss of the wine libations. The Sages felt, however, that such a decree would be too stringent for the people to observe and hence, did not institute it."
Fasts 5.7,All [the restrictions of] Tish'ah B'Av -, mentioned in Halachot 10 and 11
Fasts 5.7,[it is forbidden to eat] between sunset and the appearance of the stars -," <i>Shabbat</i> 34b explains that the Sages were undecided whether this period of time, known as <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>, should be considered to be part of the night or the day. Hence, it is necessary to be stringent both at the entry and the departure of a day associated with halachic restrictions."
Fasts 5.7,One should not eat meat or drink wine at the meal before the fast. -," the <i>seudah hamafseket</i>. Even a person who does not observe the custom of refraining from these foods during the week of Tish'ah B'Av (or the Nine Days according to Ashkenazic custom), should refrain from partaking of them in this meal. This meal should be characterized by mourning and sadness, and these foods bring happiness.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:25) associates <a href=""/16130#v27"">Ezekiel 32:27</a>: ""And their sins will be upon their bones"" with eating meat and drinking wine at this meal."
Fasts 5.7,One may eat salted meat that was slaughtered more than three days previously. -," The prohibition against eating meat was derived from the fact that with the Temple's destruction, the sacrifices were nullified. Since no sacrificial meat could be eaten on the third day and afterwards, this restriction does not apply to such meat (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 552:5).</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:2) and the later authorities explain that, at present, it is customary to refrain from partaking of even these foods at this meal."
Fasts 5.8,When does the -, need to observe the restrictions mentioned
Fasts 5.8,"If, however, one eats a meal before noon, although this is the last meal one eats before the fast, one may eat all that one desires. -"," For then, one is still far removed from the fast itself."
Fasts 5.8,"one may eat and drink to the full extent of one's needs, and one may serve even a meal resembling Solomon's feasts at one's table. -"," There are some authorities (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>) who recommend observing certain practices associated with mourning at the third Sabbath meal. Their opinions are not, however, accepted as halachah.</p>
<p>There is, however, one aspect in which this third Sabbath meal differs from the way this meal is eaten throughout the year. Generally, we are allowed to continue this meal into the night. When the fast of Tish'ah B'Av begins on Sunday, however, we must cease eating at sunset. (See Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:10.)"
Fasts 5.10,Pregnant women and those who are nursing -, although absolved from fasting on the other commemorative fasts
Fasts 5.10,"[On this day,] it is forbidden to wash in either hot or cold water -"," for the sake of pleasure. One may, however, wash one's hands to remove filth or for ritual purposes. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and commentaries, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 544:9-10.)"
Fasts 5.10,"Similarly, anointing oneself for the sake of pleasure -", in contrast to anointment for hygienic or medicinal reasons
Fasts 5.10,shoes -," is forbidden. One may, however, wear shoes made from other materials. Even leather shoes are permitted in certain instances. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:17.)"
Fasts 5.10,as on Yom Kippur. -," With this phrase, the Rambam refers the reader to his discussion of these prohibitions and the leniencies that may be granted in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i>."
Fasts 5.10,one may work. -," If, however, a person desires to refrain from working because of the unique nature of the day, he may."
Fasts 5.10,Torah scholars everywhere should remain idle on this day. -," For they should set examples to the people at large. Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:6, where he writes that ""Performing work on this day is very disgraceful."""
Fasts 5.11,Torah scholars -," Indeed, this applies also the people as a whole. Torah scholars are mentioned because they are expected to be more sensitive to the tragedy of our loss on Tish'ah B'Av.</p>
<p>The Rambam's choice of wording is based on his interpretation of the <i>Tosefta, Ta'anit</i> 3:11, ""<i>Chaverim</i> should not exchange greetings on Tish'ah B'Av,"" for the term <i>chaverim</i> is often used as a reference to Torah scholars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:20), however, interprets <i>chaverim</i> in its literal sense, that it means ""friends."""
Fasts 5.11,"Instead, they should sit in agony and frustration like mourners. -"," Nothing should be done to distract one's attention from the loss.</p>
<p>With the above expression, the Rambam also explains the rationale for these laws. When the Sages ordained the commemoration of Tish'ah B'Av, they structured its observance to resemble Yom Kippur in certain contexts, and to resemble the laws of mourning in others."
Fasts 5.11,"weakly, in a somber tone. -"," So that he also appreciates the nature of the day. See also Chapter 3, Halachah 8."
Fasts 5.11,One may study only -," Torah works that are somber in nature - e.g.,"
Fasts 5.11,Eichah -, the Book of Lamentations for the Temple's destruction. This text is read communally on Tish'ah B'Av and may be studied by individuals as well.
Fasts 5.11,Children should not study in school on this day. -," for they also derive happiness from their study (<i>Ta'anit, ibid.</i>)."
Fasts 5.19,All these [commemorative] fasts will be nullified in the Messianic era -," With the conclusion of the exile, there will be no need to mark the dates that led to it with mourning and fasting. Thus the Rambam writes at the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Megillah</i>: ""All memories of the difficulties [endured by our people] will be nullified as [<a href=""/15996#v16"">Isaiah 65:16</a>] states: 'For the former difficulties will be forgotten.'</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, fasting is not an end in its own right, but a means to motivate the Jews to return to God and correct the faults in their behavior. The coming of the redemption will be a sign that the service of repentance is complete, and thus there will be no further need for fasting."
Fasts 5.19,into holidays and days of rejoicing and celebration -," There is no possibility for the existence of an entity that is genuinely negative in nature. All those factors that appear negative represent hidden good, and furthermore, a good so powerful that the only way it can be revealed in this world is through qualities that outwardly appear negative. Their inner nature, however, is good, and in the era of the redemption when the world will be refined to the extent that it can accept this great good, this nature will be revealed."
