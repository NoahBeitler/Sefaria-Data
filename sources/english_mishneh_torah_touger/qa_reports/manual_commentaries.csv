Accordingly, the respect due to the Sabbath adds importance to the diversion of our attention from drinking implied by the statement, ""Let us recite <i>kiddush</i>."" In contrast, <i>havdalah</i> marks the beginning of the week, which we are not required to treat with such distinction. Thus, as <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:12 states, a person is not required to interrupt his meal at nightfall on Saturday, but may continue and recite <i>havdalah</i> when he concludes eating (Radbaz).
24. <i>Berachot</i> 59b emphasizes that this blessing is recited only when one drinks in a company. When one drinks alone, this blessing should not be recited, because it praises God for ""being good"" - i.e., to me - and ""doing good"" - for others (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 175:4).<br>
25. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) notes that the Sages instituted this blessing only for different types of wine and not for different types of bread or meat, since wine has two positive qualities: It satisfies a person's appetite and lifts his spirits.<br>
26. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), states that this blessing should be recited only when the second type of wine is better than the first. If the first type of wine is better, no blessing should be recited. The commentaries maintain that the Rambam differs and maintains that the blessing should be recited whenever one changes types of wine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 175:2-3) rules that if one knows that the second type of wine is of a lesser quality than the first, the blessing should not be recited.

Blessings 4.11,Berachot - Chapter 4,"Foods that are eaten within the meal, because of the meal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are quoted, with slight changes, from <i>Berachot</i> 41b. In his commentary on this passage, Rashi defines this first category of foods as relishes eaten with bread. He explains that other foods - e.g., cereals or vegetables - although they are eaten as part of a meal, require an independent blessing.
<i>Tosafot</i> differs, and maintains that any food that is eaten as part of a meal - e.g., the foods mentioned by Rashi, meat or fish - is included in this category. Even if they are not eaten with bread, merely at the same meal, they
</i>, do not require a blessing beforehand or afterward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries question whether the Rambam's position follows that of Rashi or <i>Tosafot</i>. The following sentence (which is the Rambam's addition to <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) sheds light on the question.
</i>. Rather, the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> that is recited in the beginning and the grace recited afterward include everything, because everything is secondary to the meal.<br>F<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This sentence explains the rationale for this ruling. These foods are not eaten casually during the day, but rather are eaten only as part of a meal, with the intent of satiating one's appetite. Accordingly, they are considered as secondary to bread, which is the primary element of the meal (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 177:1). Accordingly, we follow the ruling mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods.
This explanation appears to indicate that the Rambam follows<i>Tosafot's</i> interpretation. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 171:1) also rules accordingly. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:1, however, postulates that it is logical to assume that this ruling applies only when bread is eaten throughout the meal. If only a small amount of bread is eaten at the beginning of a meal, and no bread is eaten while the main course is being eaten, it is questionable whether the blessing over the bread covers these foods.
</i>oods that are eaten within the meal, but do not come because of the meal, require a blessing before partaking of them, but do not require a blessing afterward.<br>Foods that are eaten after the meal, whether because of the meal or independent of the meal, require a blessing beforehand and afterward.","Foods that are eaten within the meal, but do not come because of the meal"," This refers to fruits and the like, which are not satisfying food and are eaten throughout the day, frequently outside the context of a meal, but at times within the context of a meal. This indicates that they are not necessarily connected with the meal and, therefore, are not included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. Accordingly, they

",and eats a," כזית — The Rambam requires that a כזית be eaten, because the Rabbis instituted the custom of eating the vegetable.

Others interpret the passage as follows: the children ask without necessarily phrasing the questions precisely, and then the leader recites the standard text. Perhaps this is the source for the custom followed by many, where, after the child recites the four questions, the leader of the Seder, and, at times, each of the assembled, also recites the questions.

",Why is this night different from all other nights?,"
On all other nights, we are not required to dip even once. On this night, we dip twice? — The first three of these four questions are recorded in the Mishnah. It must be noted that the commonly accepted text of the Haggadah follows a different order, quoting that mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a. The order mentioned by the Rambam is found in the Jerusalem Talmud and the codifications of Rabbenu Asher and Rav Yitzchak Alfasi.
Perhaps, the reason for this order is that the first three questions follow the pattern the child sees at the Seder: first we dip (<i>karpas</i>,) then we eat matzah, and then we eat maror.
It must be noted that the expression ""twice"" represents somewhat of a question to the Rambam, who also requires the matzah and the sandwich to be dipped in <i>charoset</i>.

The <i>Emek HaSh'eylah</i> explains that if one forgot to recite a blessing over the <i>Chaggigah</i>, one might think that the blessing recited over the Paschal sacrifice would suffice for the previous mitzvah as well. Hence, this opinion must be negated.
</i> for] the [<i>Chaggigah</i>] offering. [C<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This follows the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Nevertheless, <i>Pesachim</i> 121a quotes Rabbi Yishmael, who offers an alternate opinion.
<i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains these Sages' difference of opinion as follows: The blood of the Paschal sacrifice is to be poured out against the base of the Temple altar. In contrast, the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> should be sprinkled on the two opposite corners of the altar.
Rabbi Yishmael maintains that בדיעבד (after the fact), were a person to pour the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering on the base of the altar, he would be considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Hence, the blessing for the Pesach offering can apply to the <i>Chaggigah</i> as well.
In contrast, Rabbi Akiva maintains that even ""after the fact,"" the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is not acceptable if its blood is not sprinkled on the altar as prescribed. Accordingly, the blessing for the Pesach offering has no connection to the <i>Chaggigah</i> at all.
The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's decision. In <i>Hilchot P'sulei HaMukdashim</i> 2:2, the Rambam writes: ""Whenever [blood] is prescribed to be presented [on the altar] by sprinkling, and it was presented by pouring, one has fulfilled his obligation,"" accepting the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. If so, his acceptance of Rabbi Akiva's opinion here appears to present a contradiction.
Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Tz'lach, Pesachim</i> ibid.) attempts to resolve the issue, explaining that the Rambam follows the interpretation of Rav Chayim HaCohen (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> ibid.), who favored a different text of the Talmud and, accordingly, an alternate interpretation of the difference in opinion between the two Sages.
Rav Chayim maintains that Rabbi Yishmael considers the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering as secondary to the Paschal sacrifice. (See also Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7.) Hence, reciting a blessing over the Paschal sacrifice, the essential element (עיקר) of the evening, also fulfills the requirement for the secondary element (טפל), the <i>Chaggigah</i>. Indeed, regarding the blessings recited over food, the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:5) that whenever there are two foods, one essential and one secondary, it is only necessary to recite a blessing over the essential food. A blessing is not required for the secondary item.
This interpretation itself presents a question: Since the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted only for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice and is not an obligation in its own right, it can be considered as ""secondary"" to the Pesach sacrifice. If so, what is the rationale for Rabbi Akiva's opinion?
It can be explained that Rabbi Akiva never considers one mitzvah as secondary to another. We may use the labels ""primary"" and ""secondary"" in regard to matters dependent on our will, but not in regard to mitzvot which we fulfill in obedience to God's desires. Therefore, though the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted because of the Paschal sacrifice, once it has been instituted, it must be considered as a mitzvah in its own right, with its own importance. Hence, it requires a unique blessing of its own (R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch Haggadah).
</i>onversely, the blessing for the <i>Chaggigah</i>] offering does not free one of [the obligation of the blessing for] the Paschal sacrifice.","[Conversely, the blessing for the Chaggigah] offering does not free one of [the obligation of the blessing for] the Paschal sacrifice"," Both Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael agree with this decision.
This law can also be explained within the context of the discussion of ""primary"" and ""secondary"" mentioned above. Since the Paschal sacrifice follows the <i>Chagigah</i> offering, for the Paschal sacrifice should be eaten when satisfied, one might presume that it is considered as ""secondary"" to the <i>Chagigah</i>. Hence, the Sages must negate this presumption.

<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot,</i> loc. cit.), however, explain that the Talmud ultimately does not accept the interpretation that the obligation is derived from the Torah, and maintain that the obligation to recite blessings is Rabbinic in origin. Even according to these opinions, it appears that the Sages ordained the recitation of blessings rather early in our national history.

Blessings 1.11,Berachot - Chapter 1,"Whenever a person listens to the entire recitation of a blessing with the intention of fulfilling his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:3) rules that the person reciting the blessing also must intend that the listener fulfill his obligation by hearing the blessing.
The <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> 213 explain that this ruling points to a question of a larger scope: Do mitzvot of the Rabbis require intention, or is it possible to fulfill one's obligation by performing the required act without any intent.
According to the latter view, although the person reciting the blessing does not have the intention of fulfilling the obligation of the listener, since ""one who listens is considered as though he responded,"" the listener is considered to have recited the blessing, and thus to have fulfilled his obligation.
In contrast, the former view requires that one have a conscious desire to fulfill one's obligation when fulfilling a Rabbinic obligation. Since the person reciting the blessing did not have such an intention on behalf of the listener, the listener cannot fulfill his obligation.

W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13, 213:1), this applies to all blessings. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:1) differs, however, and explains that with regard to blessings for mitzvot, the principle stated by the Rambam is acceptable. With regard to blessings for deriving benefit, however, different rules apply, and a person can fulfill his obligation to recite a blessing by listening to someone else's blessing only when they intentionally sit down to break bread or drink wine together. See the commentary on the following halachah.
<i>Sukkah</i> 38b states:
What is the source which teaches that a person who listens is considered as if he responded?<br>
[II Kings 22:16] mentions: ""all the words of the scroll read by the king."" Did Josaiah [the king] read them? Shafan read them.... Thus, this teaches that a person who listens is considered as if he responded.

Thus, with this statement, the Rambam is explaining that, although a person can fulfill his obligation by listening without answering <i>Amen</i>, when he answers he is considered as if he actually recited the blessing himself (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

This is the preferred manner for the group to bless their food, because ""within the multitude of people is the glory of the king"" (Proverbs 14:28 .
<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 167:18 relates that today, even when eating a meal as a group, it is customary for each person to recite the blessing over bread himself, so that an interruption is not made between the recitation of the blessing and partaking of the food.

This reflects the position of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13). The <i>Magen Avraham</i>, however, differs, and maintains that one cannot fulfill his obligation to recite blessings that involve benefit unless one had the intention of eating together with the other person and responding to his blessings.

The reason we do not respond to a gentile's blessing is that we assume that although he mentions God's name, his blessing is directed toward the alien deity in which he believes.

These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits.

</i>, to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At the conclusion of Chapter 4 of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the Rambam writes:
When a man weighs his actions constantly and directs them towards their midpoints, he will be on the most elevated human plane possible. He will thereby approach God and grasp His will. This is the most perfect path in the service of God.
Constant introspection is a necessary element in any program of personal and spiritual growth. Even when a person has the highest goals, unless he frequently looks himself squarely in the mirror and examines his behavior, he may make gross errors.

</i> One who shuns pride<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At first glance, the choice of pride as an example is rather problematic, because in Chapter 2, Halachah 3, the Rambam states:
There are traits for which it is forbidden for a person to follow an intermediate path.... Such a trait is pride...<br>
The proper path is not that a person should merely be humble, but rather hold himself very lowly...<br>
Therefore, our Sages commanded: ""Be very, very humble of spirit.""
It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary on the halachah cited above.
Possibly, it is the exaggerated contrasts in this set of traits that make it the most fitting example to demonstrate the principle of the middle path that the Rambam espouses. These gross differences allow for the possibility of clear distinctions.
</i> and turns to the other extreme<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> emphasizes that one need not actually adopt the other extreme, but rather, he should tend his behavior in that direction.

</i>. However, if he separates himself [from pride] only to the extent that he reaches the mean and displays humility, he is called wise. This is the quality of wisdom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 5:6, the Rambam contrasts the wise and the pious:
A boor is one who lacks both intellectual and ethical development...<br>
A wise man possesses both these qualities in a complete way, as is fitting.<br>
<i>A pious man is a wise man</i> who increases his piety - i.e., his emotional development - until he tends toward one extreme, as explained in Chapter 4 [of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>], and his deeds exceed his wisdom.
Thus, the wise man is one whose ethical behavior has been developed to the point at which it reflects his intellectual sophistication. He is able to appreciate the mean of each trait and express it within the context of his daily life. The pious man also possesses this quality, but due to his desire for ultimate self-refinement, he is willing to sacrifice himself and tend slightly to the extreme in certain instances.
Although in this halachah, the Rambam differentiates between the middle path - the path of the wise - and ""beyond the measure of the law"" - the path of the pious, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11 he describes how, ""according to the greatness of the Sage, should be the care he takes to go beyond the measure of the law."" Thus, it appears that a truly wise man will ultimately seek pious ways.

Human Dispositions 1.6,De'ot - Chapter 1,"[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (Exodus 14:2  and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.
It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:
[Deuteronomy 13:5 states]: ""You shall walk after God, your Lord."" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: ""Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire"" (Deuteronomy 4:24 ?<br>
Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.<br>

God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;<br>
God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;<br>
God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.
In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.
There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.
Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the ""resemblance of God"" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.

Rather, the third trait mentioned is ""piety."" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.
</i>n a similar manner, the prophets called God by other titles: ""Slow to anger,"" ""Abundant in kindness,"" ""Righteous,"" ""Just,"" ""Perfect,"" ""Almighty,"" ""Powerful,"" and the like. [They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths. A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him to the extent of his ability.","In a similar manner, the prophets"," The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.

For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man's emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.
This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).
This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions.

First, that not only a garment which is generally worn at night, but even one which is worn primarily during the day, should not have <i>techelet</i> attached to it, lest one wear it during the night.
This also sheds light on a more involved issue. There is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if the exclusion of wearing tzitzit at night applies to all tzitzit, or if it applies only to garments which are worn primarily at night. According to the latter opinion, garments worn primarily at night do not require tzitzit, even when worn during the day. In contrast, a garment which is worn primarily during the day requires tzitzit, even during the night and one does not transgress the prohibition against <i>sha'atnez</i> when wearing it at that time.
By altering the terminology used by the Talmud, the Rambam indicates his acceptance of the first perspective. Rabbenu Asher is the primary exponent of the second position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 18:1) mentions both views without reaching a conclusion.

The contention that the obligation is on the child himself is supported by <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who has eaten only a small meal can fulfill his obligation to recite the grace by answering ""Amen"" to the blessings recited by a child who has reached the age of education.

""Out of love"" refers to a love for the image and its service, while ""out of fear"" means fear of what the deity can do to the person.
Rav Kapach explains the Rambam's position, justifying the need for such a difference in interpretation. Most idolaters do not worship their images out of a genuine conviction that they are the true god, but rather for the benefit they feel this service will bring them. Therefore, were a person to serve an idol with this intent in mind, the Rambam would hold him liable. In contrast, were he to serve out of fear, he is not considered to be acting on his own volition, and hence is not held responsible.

</i>, he is not held liable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since he did not accept the deity as a god.
Although the Rambam's opinion is questioned by many other authorities, it is based on an established tradition of Talmudic interpretation. This halachah is based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 61b. That passage is also quoted in <i>Shabbat</i> 72b. Rabbenu Chanan'el, one of the foremost commentators in the generations between the Geonim and the Rambam, interprets the latter passage using the same concepts _ and almost the same phraseology _ as employed by the Rambam here.
The Ra'avad and others challenge the Rambam's interpretation and explain that ""out of love"" and ""out of fear"" mean: motivated by the love or fear of the person who tries to influence one to worship the false deity. The Rambam cannot accept this interpretation, because in <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 5:4, he states that a person who is forced to serve false gods is not held liable for his deeds (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
The fact that a person is not held liable for such service does not at all minimize the seriousness of the prohibition involved. In no way is one allowed to serve false gods for such reasons. Even with regard to the Ra'avad's interpretation ""out of fear"" - i.e., out of fear of a person - the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 150:3) prohibits performing any act that might be interpreted as idol worship - e.g., bowing to a ruler who is wearing an image.
</i>.<br>One who embraces a false deity, kisses it, sweeps before it, mops before it, washes it, anoints it, dresses it, places shoes upon it, or performs any similar act of deference violates a negative commandment, as [implied by Exodus 20:5]: ""Do not serve them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This commandment is described in Halachot 2 and 3.
</i>."" Such acts are also ""service."" The offender is, nevertheless, not<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> executed, as is one who worships a false deity, nor is he
</i> liable for lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah].<br>If one of the above services was the accepted mode of worship [of a particular deity] and a person performed this service as an act of worship, he is liable [for execution].","punished by lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah]"," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that punishment is not given because this prohibition is a לאו שבכללות - i.e., it includes many different forbidden acts. Lashes are not given for the violation of such a prohibition, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3.
To explain: The prohibition, ""Do not serve them,"" is twofold in nature. It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.
Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes. Since, in essence, this prohibition is not associated with lashes, even the many transgressions of a lesser nature which are also included within this prohibition are also not punishable in this manner (Rav Kapach).

He resolves that difficulty, explaining that in Halachah 5, the person intended to throw the stone at the idol. Since that act constitutes worship of this deity, he is held liable.

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 150:5 notes that many communities are not stringent in the observance of this law and quotes sources which explain that since buildings owned by gentiles are often taller than the synagogue, the synagogue is not likely to be the tallest building in the city in any case.

However, once chametz belonging to a Jew becomes prohibited, that Jew no longer has the authority to sell it. Thus, the purchaser will never really become the legal owner of the chametz (See Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 35a; <i>Tosefot, Chullin</i> 4b).
The <i>Or Sameach</i> questions how a person can become liable even for chametz purchased from a gentile, but resolves the issue based on the commentary of Rabbenu Nissim (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, Chapter 3).
</i> or [caused flour] to become leavened, and thus committed a deed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> raises a significant question: A person is not liable for lashes for violating any prohibition which he can correct by fulfilling a positive commandment (לעשה לאו הניתק): For example, if a person violates the prohibition against taking both a mother bird and her eggs, he can free himself from the punishment of lashes by sending away the mother bird.
<i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 29b) states that the prohibition against chametz being seen in one's property falls into the above category, because one can correct the violation of this prohibition by fulfilling the positive commandment to destroy chametz. Thus, it appears that a person can never be held liable for lashes for this transgression.
Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that of Rav Chayim Soloveitchik, who explains that <i>Tosefot's</i> statements apply only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who maintains that chametz must be destroyed by burning. However, according to the Sages (whose opinion is accepted by the Rambam, Halachah 3:11), who maintain that chametz can be destroyed by any means, not necessarily burning, the prohibition against possessing chametz is not considered a לאו הניתק לעשה.
What is the essential difference between these opinions: Rabbi Yehudah maintains that the fundamental aspect of the mitzvah to destroy chametz revolves upon the article itself (חפצה); it is a mitzvah to destroy chametz. In contrast, the Sages maintain that the mitzvah centers on the person (גברה); he is commanded to remove all chametz from his possession.
According to Rabbi Yehudah, since the commandment revolves around the chametz itself, its destruction directly ""corrects"" the sin of its possession. In contrast, according to the Sages, the positive commandment of ridding one's house of chametz is merely a reinforcement of the prohibition against its possession, and the fulfillment of the positive commandment does not have the power to ""correct"" the violation of the prohibition.

Nevertheless, this decision is a matter of debate among the commentators. The Ramban (<i>Hasagot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>) does not accept the Rambam's view, and explains that a person who consumes an olive size of chametz within the specific time period (פרס כדי אכילת) described below should be liable for כרת as described in Halachah 1. See also Halachah 4:8 and commentary.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> supports the Ramban's view, noting that in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:3, the Rambam himself explains that any person who eats a mixture containing an olive size of a forbidden food within this time period is liable, just as if he had eaten the forbidden food itself.
Based on the explanation of the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442), the <i>Drisha</i> and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> interpret the Rambam as referring to a mixture to which the chametz does not impart any flavor and is added only for consistency and color.
The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> offers a different interpretation, explaining that were chametz to be mixed with other foods, a person eating the mixture would be liable for כרת as the Ramban states. However, the Rambam is talking about an instance when flour was mixed with another substance and became leavened as part of the mixture, without ever becoming a distinct entity of its own. The Torah considers this as a different category of chametz and holds a person who eats it liable for a lesser punishment.

Just as the Torah requires a specific quantity, the size of an olive, as regards many of the mitzvot and prohibitions concerning eating, it also specifies a limited period in which this amount of food must be consumed: אבילת פרס כדי.
This measure is also a point of Rabbinic controversy. The Rambam defines it as the time it takes to eat three eggs (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 14:8). Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 44a) takes a more lenient view, defining it as the amount of time it takes to eat four eggs. As regards this matter as well, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 612:4) advises that whenever a question of Torah law is involved, the more stringent opinion should be observed. However, in questions of Rabbinic law, the more lenient view can be relied on.
In converting this figure to modern measures of time, there is also a difference of opinion. The shortest opinion limits this period to two minutes. The most commonly accepted view is four minutes and there are opinions of seven and eight minutes as well.

Rav Yitzchak ben Sheshet (Responsum 131) notes that the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 11:5) rules that one should recite the blessing ""...concerning the redemption of a son,"" implying that the mitzvah is not the father's, but the son's (merely that as an infant, the son cannot fulfill it). In contrast, in Chapter 3, Halachah 1, the Rambam states that a father should recite the blessing ""... to circumcise...,"" implying that the mitzvah is his.

</i>.""<br>A father<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and not a mother (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a)
</i> is commanded to circumcise his son<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although when the son reaches the age of <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he is obligated by the mitzvah. Until that time, the father is responsible for the fulfillment of the mitzvah.
The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 2) questions the extent of the father's responsibility. If the father does not circumcise his son before the latter reaches majority, is the father still charged with the mitzvah (together with the son) or is the son solely responsible for the mitzvah?
<i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (Vol. 11) explains that the question is dependent on a difference of opinion between the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. The Babylonian Talmud (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a) derives the mitzvah from the verse (Genesis 21:4 , ""And Avraham circumcised his son, Isaac."" This indicates that the mitzvah is primarily the father's (although after the son reaches adulthood, he also becomes responsible). In contrast, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7) quotes as a proof-text for the mitzvah (Leviticus 12:3 , ""On the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised."" The <i>Korban Eidah</i> explains that this implies the mitzvah is the son's. Since he is not able to perform it himself as a youth, however, his father is given the responsibility while the child is a minor.
<i>Likkutei Sichot</i> continues, explaining that the Rambam's position is obvious from his discussion of the blessings recited for the mitzvot in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i>, Chapter 11. In Halachah 11 of that chapter, the Rambam explains that if one performs a mitzvah on one's own behalf, one should use the form, ""who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us </i>, and a master, his slaves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, the responsibility for the mitzvah is surely the master's. This circumcision is one of the stages in the process by which the slave attains the status of <i>eved C'na'ani</i>, an intermediate rung between a gentile and a Jew. He is obligated to fulfill all the negative commandments and all those positive commandments that are not associated with a specific time. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 12:11.)
</i>. This applies both to those who are born in his home<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., a non-Jewish maidservant gave birth to a male child
</i> and to those purchased by him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Genesis 17:27, which relates that Abraham circumcised both these categories of servants.
</i>. If the father or the master transgressed and did not circumcise them, he negated the fulfillment of a positive commandment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:6):
If a person transgressed and did not circumcise his son or his servants born in his home... on the eighth day, he transgresses a very great and severe mitzvah, to which there is no comparison among the other mitzvot. He can never compensate for [the lack of fulfillment of] this mitzvah.<br>
His sin is much more severe than a person who did not build a sukkah on Sukkot, or one who did not eat matzah on Pesach.

The proof-text quoted mentions the eighth day. Nevertheless, <i>Yevamot</i> 72b uses the rules of Biblical exegesis to demonstrate that

H<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i>, Chapter 3, the Sanhedrin would send messengers to all Jewish communities to inform them when each new month had begun. The communities which received this information before the Sukkot festival celebrated the holidays for only one day. They would be allowed to take the lulav when the first day of Sukkot fell on the Sabbath.
<i>Sukkot</i> 41b relates:

They would bring their lulavim to the Temple Mount [on Friday]. The attendants would take them from them and place them on benches. The elders would place their lulavim in chambers. They would teach them to say: ""Whoever receives my lulav may consider it as a gift.""
In the morning, they would arise and come [to the Temple]. The attendants would throw [the lulavim] to the people. They would grab them from one another and even come to violence. When the court saw that the situation was becoming dangerous, they ordained that each person should take [the lulav] in his own home.

The Willow Branches Placed Around The Temple Altar

How was this mitzvah performed?<br>On each of the seven days [of the festival], branches of willows were brought a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> from Motza, a small town slightly west of Jerusalem (<i>Sukkah</i> 45a).
</i>nd stood upright near the altar w<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From this fact, Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> conclude that the willows were taken by priests only because Israelites were not allowed to approach the Temple altar.
</i>ith their tops bent over the altar. When they would bring them and arrange them [near the altar,] a series of [shofar blasts] - <i>teki'ah, teru'ah,</i> and <i>teki'ah</i> - were sounded.<br>When the Sabbath fell in the midst of the festival, the willows would not be arranged [near the altar] unless the seventh day fell on the Sabbath. [On such an occasion,] the willows were arranged [near the altar], to publicize the fact that [taking] them is a mitzvah.",with their tops bent over the altar," These willow branches were eleven cubits high and were placed on the base of the altar.
Afterwards, they would be taken by the people, as stated in the following halachah. Rabbenu Manoach maintains that the priests would take the willow branches and give them to the people because Israelites were not allowed to approach the altar, as above. However, he notes that Rav Yitzchak ibn Giat's description of the mitzvah could be interpreted to mean that the Israelites themselves were permitted to approach the altar on this occasion.

The Willow Branches Placed Around The Temple Altar

How was this mitzvah performed?<br>On each of the seven days [of the festival], branches of willows were brought a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> from Motza, a small town slightly west of Jerusalem (<i>Sukkah</i> 45a).
</i>nd stood upright near the altar w<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These willow branches were eleven cubits high and were placed on the base of the altar.
Afterwards, they would be taken by the people, as stated in the following halachah. Rabbenu Manoach maintains that the priests would take the willow branches and give them to the people because Israelites were not allowed to approach the altar, as above. However, he notes that Rav Yitzchak ibn Giat's description of the mitzvah could be interpreted to mean that the Israelites themselves were permitted to approach the altar on this occasion.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From this fact, Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> conclude that the willows were taken by priests only because Israelites were not allowed to approach the Temple altar.
</i>ith their tops bent over the altar. When they would bring them and arrange them [near the altar,] a series of [shofar blasts] - <i>teki'ah, teru'ah,</i> and <i>teki'ah</i> - were sounded.<br>W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as an expression of happiness (<i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i>, ibid.). The shofar was also sounded in connection with the communal sacrifices and other rites carried out in the Temple.
</i>hen the Sabbath fell in the midst of the festival, the willows would not be arranged [near the altar] unless the seventh day fell on the Sabbath. [On such an occasion,] the willows were arranged [near the altar], to publicize the fact that [taking] them is a mitzvah.","When the Sabbath fell in the midst of the festival, the willows would not be arranged [near the altar]"," on the Sabbath, since the mitzvah of lulav was negated on such an occasion (Halachah 13). Indeed, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 4:3), the Rambam writes that the reason the mitzvah of taking the willow on the Sabbath was negated was so that people would not extend the leniency and take the lulav as well.

Once David was anointed, he acquired the crown of royalty. Afterwards, the kingship belongs to him and his male descendants, forever.

Similarly, on the verse from Deuteronomy quoted below, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 59a comments: ""It is our inheritance and not theirs.""
[Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that the same passage in <i>Sanhedrin</i> also describes the high levels which a gentile can attain by studying the rules of the seven general laws of human behavior given to Noah and his descendants.

Nevertheless, although, as the above verse implies, each Jew has an inherent connection to Torah, effort must be expended in order to reveal and develop that connection. In that vein, <i>Avot</i> 2:15 counsels: ""Prepare yourself to study Torah, for it is not an inheritance."" Therefore, the Rambam continues...

b) A commitment to devote oneself to Torah study that has no limitations.
The first aspect reflects a commitment that takes into consideration man's perspective, and, hence, is limited in scope.

(See <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 3:1.) Nor does he necessarily stipulate that ""a life of difficulty"" is a prerequisite for complete involvement in Torah study. However, it is often the only path with which one can attain that goal.
Frequently, earning enough to live a life of comfort takes so much time that one will not be able to devote himself to Torah study in a fitting manner. Furthermore, indulgence in comfort often leads a person to preoccupation with his own needs and desires. Suddenly, he becomes faced with an entire host of ""necessities,"" without which he cannot continue.

These convictions are also expressed in <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'yim</i> 10:18, which states:
Even a dignified Sage who becomes poor should work in a profession, even a degrading profession, rather than seek public assistance. It is better to skin the hides of dead animals than to tell the people, ""I am a Sage, support me.""<br>

Though the Rambam quotes many examples of sages who performed simple labors to earn their livelihood, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains how none of them can be taken to be conclusive proof of the Rambam's position.
For example, the Rambam quotes <i>Yoma</i> 35b, which relates how Hillel would do simple work to earn his sustenance. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Talmud's statements about Hillel were made before his greatness was appreciated. There is no proof that he continued working as a common laborer afterwards.
The practice of taking payment for Torah study has its source in <i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i> 106a, which relates that individuals who give up the opportunity to earn their livelihood in other professions so that they can teach Torah or serve as judges are able to receive remuneration, because, in essence, they are not receiving payment for their Torah, but for their time.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> concludes:
It is possible to explain that our master's intention is that a person should not cast off the yoke of labor in order to receive his livelihood from others in order to study. Rather, first, he should learn a profession with which he can sustain himself. If that is sufficient for him, it is good. If not, he may receive his livelihood from the community...<br>
Even if this is not our master's intention, as apparent from his Commentary on the Mishnah, whenever one is in doubt about the halachah, one should follow the custom. We have seen all the Sages of Israel, both before and after our master, accepting their livelihood from the community.<br>

Even a dignified Sage who becomes poor should work in a profession, even a degrading profession, rather than seek public assistance. It is better to skin the hides of dead animals than to tell the people, ""I am a Sage, support me.""<br>
Our greatest Sages were wood-choppers, porters, water-drawers... They did not ask anything from the public and refused to accept anything that was given to them.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> takes issue with the Rambam's statements and states that there is no prohibition against a Torah Sage receiving support from others. Though the Rambam quotes many examples of sages who performed simple labors to earn their livelihood, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains how none of them can be taken to be conclusive proof of the Rambam's position.
For example, the Rambam quotes <i>Yoma</i> 35b, which relates how Hillel would do simple work to earn his sustenance. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Talmud's statements about Hillel were made before his greatness was appreciated. There is no proof that he continued working as a common laborer afterwards.
The practice of taking payment for Torah study has its source in <i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i> 106a, which relates that individuals who give up the opportunity to earn their livelihood in other professions so that they can teach Torah or serve as judges are able to receive remuneration, because, in essence, they are not receiving payment for their Torah, but for their time.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> concludes:
It is possible to explain that our master's intention is that a person should not cast off the yoke of labor in order to receive his livelihood from others in order to study. Rather, first, he should learn a profession with which he can sustain himself. If that is sufficient for him, it is good. If not, he may receive his livelihood from the community...<br>
Even if this is not our master's intention, as apparent from his Commentary on the Mishnah, whenever one is in doubt about the halachah, one should follow the custom. We have seen all the Sages of Israel, both before and after our master, accepting their livelihood from the community.<br>
Furthermore, even if the halachah followed our master..., it is possible that all the sages of the [previous] generations agreed to do so because...if the livelihood of the scholars and the teachers were not available, they would not be able to labor in Torah as is fitting, and the Torah would be forgotten, Heaven forbid. Since it is available, they are able to study, ""and Torah is magnified and becomes stronger.""
These ideas are quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:5). It must be noted that even the Rambam (Chapter 6, Halachah 10, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>ibid.,Hilchot De'ot</i> 6:2) allows a person to give a sage money to invest, or to afford him other benefits in commerce and trade.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 5, and <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 1:4, the Rambam mentions the severity of the sin of desecrating God's name.
</i>ishonors the Torah, extinguishes the light of faith, brings evil upon himself, and forfeits the life of the world to come, for it is forbidden to derive benefit from the words of Torah in this world.<br>Our Sages declared:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avot</i> 4:5.
</i> ""Whoever benefits from the words of Torah forfeits his life in the world<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quoted above refers to the Rambam's commentary on this Mishnah. Major portions of the Rambam's statements are cited in our commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 7.
</i>."" Also, they commanded and declared:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avot, ibid.</i> The Rambam reverses the order of the statements in the Mishnah, perhaps, because the first clause is more explicit. Alternatively, because chronologically, Hillel, the author of the latter clause, preceded Rabbi Tzadok, the author of the former.
</i> ""Do not make them a crown to magnify oneself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a source of honor,

Also, they commanded and declared: ""Love work and despise Rabbinic positions<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam writes: ""Without work, it will be difficult for him for him, and he will steal and cheat. Seeking positions of honor will bring about challenges.""
Similarly, <i>Avot</i> 2:2 teaches:
</i>."" All Torah that is not accompanied by work will eventually be negated and lead to sin. U<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> That Mishnah begins: ""Torah is beautiful when accompanied by work.""
</i>ltimately, such a person will steal from others.","Ultimately, such a person will steal from others"," The commentaries cite <i>Kiddushin</i> 29a: ""Whoever does not teach his son a profession is as if he taught him to steal,"" as the source for the Rambam's statements.

The Rambam (see the Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>ibid.</i>) holds the very opposite. The common people will respect a person who honestly earns his livelihood and will look down on a person who derives his income from charity.

The children should not neglect [their studies] at all, except at the end of the day on the eve of the Sabbaths and festivals<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., they should study on the mornings of these days, but not in the afternoons.
The commentaries have questioned the source for the Rambam's statements. Some have pointed to <i>Sukkah</i> 28a, which praises Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai for never leaving the house of study except on the eve of Pesach and the eve of Yom Kippur. Similarly, <i>Pesachim</i> 109a applies such praise to Rabbi Akiva. However, it is difficult to say that these are the sources for the Rambam's statements. Firstly, the passages refer to adults and not to children. Also, the fact that these passages cite the behavior of these Sages as worthy of praise seems to imply that it was exceptional and not the rule followed by most.
</i> and on the festivals themselves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for study might disturb a child's conception of the air of rejoicing and celebration that must accompany the festivals. It must be noted that the Rambam suggests that adults use some of their time on the festivals to study (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 6:19).
</i>. On the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> They should not cease their studies. Nevertheless...
</i>, they should not begin new material<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for grasping it may involve difficulty and strain, which should be avoided on the Sabbath. (See <i>Nedarim</i> 37a.)
</i>. However, they should review what was learned already<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for this does not involve tremendous strain.
</i>.<br>The children should never be interrupted from their studies, even for the building of the Temple<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 119b makes this statement in the context of its description of the great merit of the children's study, as mentioned in the previous halachah. Indeed, this appears to be the Rambam's logic in the entire halachah. Since children's study is so important, no unnecessary interruptions should be made.
</i>.","This rigorous schedule of study is not followed today. Among the reasons given are the different goals for Torah study at present from those in the previous generations, as described in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 12. Alternatively, if today youth were subjected to such a schedule, they might rebel and no value would come of it.<br>","

A stolen article whose form has not changed...even though its owner has despaired of its recovery...must be returned to its owner.

Thus, the article is not considered to belong to the thief, and he may not use it to fulfill the mitzvah. However, if the thief performed a deed which changed the appearance of the lulav or any of the other species, he is considered to have acquired it and may fulfill the mitzvah with it.

In these instances, the nullification of the <i>ashera</i> will not cause it to be permitted for use; rather, it must be totally destroyed. Hence, it is considered to have no size at all, and, therefore, may not be used for the mitzvah (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). (See also the Commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 3.)
Alternatively, since the <i>ashera</i> itself was worshiped, it may no longer be used for a mitzvah. A parallel can be found in <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 1:11, which relates that the wool of a sheep that was worshiped may not be used for tzitzit, although that wool does not become prohibited.

In this context, only a stolen sukkah is disqualified and a borrowed sukkah is permitted (<i>Sukkah</i> 27b).
Since in both cases, the source for the exclusion is the same phrase, one might ask why the laws pertaining to each are different. Many explain that since, as explained in the commentary to that halachah, the Torah includes a special verse to teach us that a borrowed sukkah is permitted, the scope of the exclusion implied by ""for yourself"" is limited.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 637:3 explains that since the person owning the sukkah grants his colleague the use of it, the borrowed sukkah can be considered ""as his own."" Since a person has to treat a sukkah as his permanent dwelling for the seven days of the holiday, it follows that the sukkah was lent for that purpose. Thus, while a person is using it, he may consider it ""as his own,"" i.e., just like his own dwelling. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 19.

If he does not return it, he does not fulfill his obligation, because it is as though it were stolen.<br>[On the first day,] a lulav should not be given to a minor, since, according to Torah law, a minor can acquire articles but cannot transfer them to others. Thus, [the minor's] return of the article is not considered to be a return [from a legal perspective].<br>The above applies to the lulav and to each of the other species of the four taken with it.

He quotes the Rashba, who explains that since the etrog was purchased with the intent that it be used by each member of that community, implicit in their agreement is that, on the first day, it will belong to each individual entirely at the time he uses it to fulfill the mitzvah.
The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 648:7) quotes this statement as halachah. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 648:10 raises questions concerning it and suggests that each member of the community should grant his colleague his share as a present.
</i>.<br>Should brothers purchase etrogim from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet: If one of them takes an etrog with the intent of fulfilling his obligation, [the following rules apply:] If he could eat it without the other brothers objecting, he has fulfilled his obligation. If they would object, he does not fulfill his obligation until they give him their share [in the etrog] as a present.<br>If one brother bought an etrog and another a quince, or together they bought an etrog, a pomegranate, and a quince from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet, one cannot fulfill one's obligation with the etrog until the others give him their share [in it] as a present, even though they would not object to his [use of it].","Should brothers purchased etrogim from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet:"," This is the case mentioned in <i>Bava Batra</i> (ibid.), from which the above principle is derived. In such an instance, the estate is considered to be the mutual property of all the brothers concerned.

The Rambam's interpretation of the mishnah is not accepted by other authorities. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>) rules that only complicated activities are forbidden and simple acts, e.g., a snack or a normal haircut are permitted.
This disagreement finds expression in the rulings of the later authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) quotes the Rambam's view. The Ramah brings a third opinion (of the <i>Ba'al HaMa'or</i>) which rules that even a large meal is permissible before <i>Minchah Gedolah</i>, and that a snack is permissible even before <i>Minchah K'tanah</i>. He adds that perhaps the reason for this leniency is that since it was customary to call people to synagogue, it is unlikely that they would not forget to go.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 6,"When is the beginning of a haircut?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Halachah 5, the Rambam taught us that if one had already begun his involvement in any of these activities, he need not stop in order to recite <i>Minchah</i>.

From that point on, even though no hair has actually been cut, he is considered involved in the haircut, so that he need not stop to pray.

This is based on the Rambam's interpetation of <i>Shabbat</i> 9b: ""When he removes his מעפרתו from himself."" Rashi, in his commentary on that passage, offers a different interpretation - one's outermost garment, i.e., the first garment removed. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) rules in line with Rashi's position.

This was not the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
It is interesting to note that in his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions only the halachah of washing one's hands. Since the Mishnah was written in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, its interpretation must be in line with the customs and realities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam focuses on the actual halachah. Hence, he defines the beginning of eating in line with both positions, one relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the other to Babylonia.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 9b records a disagreement between Rav and Rabbi Chanina. Rav states that washing one's hands constitutes the beginning of eating, whereas Rabbi Chanina is of the opinion that loosening one's belt before eating is the beginning of the meal. The Talmud concludes that there is no real argument. Rav described the halachah for inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and Rabbi Chanina, for those of Babylonia.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 9b states simply: ""When he ties between his shoulders."" In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that it is when he ties his belt in order to work with the skins. Evidently this means the belt around his apron. There is a version of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah which mentions also that he begins working with the skins. This is, however, hard to understand in light of his commentary here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.
</i>.<br>When is the beginning of eating? For those who live in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is when one washes his hands.

If they were [already] sitting, it is when the adversaries begin to make their claims.",When is the beginning of judgment?

This applies only to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues, whose full time occupation was the study of Torah, but we stop studying to recite the <i>Shema</i> and to pray.
Rashi explains that anyone who interrupts his studies in order to work, must also interrupt his studies in order to pray.
</i>, and he is involved in the study of Torah at the time of prayer, he need not stop, since the commandment of the study of Torah is greater that the commandment of prayer.<br>Anyone involved in efforts for the welfare of the community is like one involved in Torah study.","and he is involved in the study of Torah at the time of prayer, he need not stop, since the commandment of the study of Torah is greater than the commandment of prayer"," In <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:3, the Rambam states: ""There is no commandment among all the commandments that is equal to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah is equal to all the other commandments, since study brings one to action. Therefore, study comes before action at all times.""
A person involved in Torah study achieves a level of unity with God that is unparalleled by any other activity. One's intellect and God's wisdom become inextricably linked, until they are indistinguishable during the moments of one's actual involvement in study. On this basis, we can understand the description of Torah with the metaphor of bread (Proverbs 9:5, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13). After bread is consumed by a person, it becomes assimilated into his blood and becomes part of the person himself. Similarly, when Torah is studied, it becomes absorbed into the person's character and becomes an integral part of his being (<i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 5).
As explained in the introduction to this text, prayer focuses on our attempt to relate to the Godliness that permeates our worldly existence. Though this is an extremely significant service, the connection established through Torah study is more complete. Thus, <i>Shabbat</i> 10a records how Ravvah rebuked Rav Hamnuna for neglecting his Torah studies to prolong his prayers. By doing he was ""abandoning eternal life for transcient life."" Therefore, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues whose commitment to Torah was all encompassing were not required to interrupt their studies for prayer.

Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> explain that the distinction between <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and the <i>Amidah</i> is based on the fact that the recital of the <i>Shema</i> is a Torah obligation. Some commentaries explain that this explanation would even be acceptable according to the Rambam. Though he holds that the <i>Amidah</i> is also a Torah obligation (see Chapter 1, Halachah 1), it is only necessary to pray once daily in order to fulfill one's Torah obligation. Therefore, one may be more lenient in granting an exemption from the <i>Amidah</i>, since the Torah obligation may have already been fulfilled or may be fulfilled by another <i>Amidah</i> later in the day.
However, the Rambam, himself, offers a different explanation in his commentary on the Mishnah. There, he states that since one is troubled (לבו טרוד) by the burial, he is exempt from the <i>Amidah</i>. This seems to be a function of the greater need for intention in the <i>Amidah</i> rather than its non-Torah status.

Hence, if no interruption is made between the two, it is unnecessary - and therefore, we are forbidden - to recite a second blessing.
This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:5) and is followed by all Sephardic authorities and some Ashkenazic authorities. The majority of the Ashkenazic community follows the opinion of Rabbenu Asher (quoted by the Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) which maintains that the two blessings should be recited even when no interruption is made between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>.
This opinion agrees that the blessing ""...to put on <i>tefillin</i>"" also applies to the head <i>tefillin</i>. Therefore, even according to this opinion, it is forbidden to make an interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>; nevertheless, the Sages instituted a second blessing in recognition of the unique importance and holiness of the head <i>tefillin</i>.

Rabbi Yosse HaG'lili interprets the verse as referring to <i>tefillin</i>, and explains that it teaches that <i>tefillin</i> should not be worn at night, nor on Sabbaths and holidays.

Though he maintains that <i>tefillin</i> should be worn at night, he agrees that they should not be worn on Sabbaths and holidays, and derives that concept from the verse, ""And they shall be a sign....""
The Rambam quotes the proof-texts cited by both the differing opinions because each one clearly alludes to the halachic principles he seeks to express (Radbaz, Vol. V, Responsum 1693). For this same reason, he sees no difficulty in quoting the verse, ""And you shall observe these statutes..."" in <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 1:7 according to the interpretation of Rabbi Akiva.

On the contrary, in Talmudic times (see Halachah 25), <i>tefillin</i> would be worn throughout the day, even during one's involvement in mundane affairs.
Accordingly, the Rabbis (see <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 28:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 44:3) explain that here, by ""diversion of attention,"" the Rabbis meant that a person's mind should not become focused on frivolous matters or on his bodily needs to the extent that he forgets about the fear of God. Thus, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 38:4) states that a person who cannot control himself from thinking about lewd things should not put on <i>tefillin</i>, and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 38:8 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 38:30 free a person who is troubled by cold from the obligation of wearing <i>tefillin</i>.
The <i>Sha'agat Arieh</i> (Responsum 39), however, interprets the Rambam's words very strictly and maintains that, according to the Rambam, even the slightest diversion of attention from <i>tefillin</i> is forbidden.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.1","Shofar, Sukkah, vLulav - Chapter 4","These are the required measurements of a sukkah: Its height<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., the height of its inner space, without including the height of the <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Eruvin</i> 3b)
</i> should not be less than ten handbreadths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> anything less is not considered to be a dwelling fit for human habitation (See <i>Sukkah</i> 4a.) <i>Sukkah</i> 4b-5a derives the concept as follows: The ark and the <i>kaporet</i> covering it were ten handbreadths high. This constituted a line of demarcation between the place where the <i>Shechinah</i> was manifest and the area below it. Thus, we see that a height of ten handbreadths is sufficient for an independent area.
Rabbenu Manoach establishes a closer relationship between the above concept and a sukkah, noting that Exodus 25:20 describes how the wings of the cherubs ""shall shield the <i>kaporet</i>,"" using the verb סככים, which has the same root as the word <i>s'chach</i>. The beginning of the height of the cherub's ""shield,"" ten cubits, is the minimum of the height for our <i>s'chach</i>.

Hence, it is unfit to serve as a sukkah, which must be of a temporary nature. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 2a and the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah.)[ It must be noted that any structure less than 20 cubits high can serve as a sukkah even if its walls are of a permanent nature.]
A cubit is 48 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 57.6 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.
</i>. Its area should not be less than seven handbreadths by seven handbreadths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the minimum size necessary to contain a person's head, the majority of his body [6 handbreadths by six handbreadths], and a small table [a handbreadth by a handbreadth] (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:8). A handbreadth is 8 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 9.6 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.
The Rambam explains the requirement of seven handbreadths by seven hand breadths as follows: The first three hand breadths are not of consequence because of the principle of <i>l'vud</i> and four additional handbreadths are required since the smallest area of halachic consequence is four cubits by four cubits (Commentary, to the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1).
If the sukkah is not seven handbreadths in either length or width, it is invalid, even if its area equals 49 square handbreadths. If it is round in shape, it must be sufficiently large to encompass a square seven by seven (See Halachah 7). This size is required because if either of the dimensions were less, it would not be considered a dwelling fit for human habitation (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 634:1-2; <i>Magen Avraham; Taz</i>).

The Rabbis have posed an abstract question: Is the minimum requirement for a sukkah three walls (including one which is incomplete), or must a sukkah have four walls, however, the Torah was lenient enough to consider a sukkah of this nature as comparable to one of four walls.
The <i>Marcheshet</i> brings support for the latter view, quoting <i>Sukkah</i> 7b, which states that since the third wall only a handbreadth in size is considered to be a wall with regard to the laws of sukkah, it is also considered to be a wall with regard to the laws regarding a private domain on the Sabbath.

</i>: If they are more than three handbreadths above the earth, they are invalid<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 16a records a difference of opinion between the Sages whether a ""hanging partition"" - i.e., a partition that is not connected to the earth - is kosher. The halachah does not accept such a partition, because animals can crawl under it. (See <i>Shabbat</i> 97a.) Nevertheless...
</i>; if the distance is less than that<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> three handbreadths
</i>, they are kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Because of the principle of <i>l'vud</i>, it is considered as if they actually reach the ground.
</i>.<br>[The following rules apply] should the walls be connected to the earth, without reaching the <i>s'chach</i>: I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> they are considered to be a viable partition. Therefore...
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the accompanying diagram.
</i>f they are ten handbreadths high, they are kosher even though are removed several cubits from the roof, provided they are positioned below the end of the roof. If the roof was separated from the wall by more than three handbreadths, it is invalid; less than this amount is kosher.<br>

A Sukkah Whose Walls Do Not Reach
The S'chach<br><br>
A) The Width Of The Sukkah; At Least Seven
Handbreadths<br>
B) The Length Of The Sukkah; At Least Seven
Hand breadths<br>
C) The Total Height Of The Sukkah; More
Than Ten Handbreadths<br>
D) The Minimum Height Of The Walls. Ten
Handbreadths<br>
E) The Space Between The Wall And The
S'chach

If one suspended a partition which is slightly more than four handbreadths high at a distance of less than three handbreadths from the earth and a distance of less than three handbreadths from the roof, it is kosher.

",they are kosher even though they are removed several cubits from the roof," We say גוד אסיק מחיצתא - ""Pull up and raise the partition;"" i.e., it is considered as if the partition has been extended upward and reaches the <i>s'chach</i>. See <i>Sukkah</i> 4b for an additional discussion of this concept.
Though this concept is accepted, we do not say מחיצתא גוד אחית - ""Pull down and extend the partition."" Hence, in the first clause of this halachah, the partition is not acceptable until it reaches three cubits of the ground.
[It is possible to distinguish between the two cases as follows. A partition on the ground that must be extended upward serves as a functional divider. In contrast, a partition hanging downward cannot adequately fulfill its purpose unless it reaches within three handbreadths of the ground. (See also the <i>Or Sameach's</i> resolution of a difficulty arising from <i>Eruvin</i> 79a.)]

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.5","Shofar, Sukkah, vLulav - Chapter 4","When a person constructs his sukkah among the trees<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah does not deal with the problem of the branches and leaves of the trees interfering with the <i>s'chach</i>. That issue is dealt with in Chapter 5, Halachah 12. Rabbenu Manoach and others have also raised questions whether the <i>s'chach</i> should be supported by the trees. (See the commentary on the following halachah.)
</i>, using the trees as walls, it is kosher if<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the following two conditions are met

</i>ith hay and straw, tying them so that they will not be shaken by the wind.

[This is necessary,] for any partition that cannot stand before a normal land wind is not considered to be a partition.",with hay and straw," weaving them together so that the wall would be a solid continuum (<i>Sukkah</i> 24b)

",it is kosher. - for the fact that the roof is slanted does not disqualify the sukkah.,"
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Manoach, and others explain that though leniency is taken and such a sukkah is allowed, it must still possess all the dimensions required of a kosher sukkah mentioned in Halachah 1 of this chapter. Accordingly, at least six handbreadths of the slanted roof must itself be kosher for use as <i>s'chach</i>, and it must be more than 16 handbreadths long, so that it will be of the required height. When the Sukkah meets these qualifications, one is permitted to eat and sleep within it. (See also Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 631:10.)

A Sukkah That Was Hollowed Out From

A) Ground Level<br>
B) The Depth Of The Area Hollowed
Out; For Example, Two Handbreadths<br>
C) The Height Of The Wall Above The
Ground, Eight Handbreadths<br>
D) The Distance Between The Hollowed
Out Area And The Wall, Less Than Three
Handbreadths<br>
E) The Length Of The Hollowed Out
Portion; At Least Seven Handbreadths<br>
F) The Width Of The Hollowed Out Portion;
At Least Seven Handbreadths

[The following rule applies] when [the inner space of the sukkah] was less than ten [handbreadths high]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the minimum height required by Halachah 1.

</i>: If there are three handbreadths from the edge of the pit until the wall [of the sukkah], it is not acceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> One might assume that as long as there are less than four cubits between the edge of the pit and the sukkah, the sukkah would be kosher, because of the principle mentioned in the previous halachah; i.e., the ground of the sukkah would be considered to be an extension of the wall. Nevertheless, <i>Sukkah</i> 4a differentiates between the two cases. In the situation described in the previous halachah, the wall was of the proper size; the only question was its proximity to the sukkah. In this instance, there is no halachically acceptable wall to begin with.
</i>. If there is less than that [amount], it is kosher, because any [distance] less than three [handbreadths] is considered to be [insignificant, and the two entities are considered to be] adjacent [to each other], as explained in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>.","If there is less than that [amount], it is kosher - The"," <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 633:29 quotes authorities who maintain that only the area within the pit is kosher, and one does not fulfill the mitzvah of eating or sleeping in the sukkah by performing these activities in the portion covered by the <i>s'chach</i> outside the pit.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.16","Shofar, Sukkah, vLulav - Chapter 4","The walls of the sukkah are kosher [although made] from all [substances]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 12b) mentions many substances which are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> (as mentioned in the following chapter), and concludes ""all are fit to be used as walls.""
</i>. All that is necessary is a barrier of any kind<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 630:1) explains that one should take care not to use substances that have an unpleasant odor or substances that will shrivel during the holiday, and thus cause the walls to be less than the required measure.
</i>. Even living beings [may serve that purpose<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 630:11) states that an animal used for this purpose must be tied so that it will not run away.
</i>. Thus,] a person can create a wall [of the sukkah] by using a colleague so that he can eat, drink, and sleep in the sukkah, for which his colleague is serving as a wall<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> raises the question whether the person serving as the wall can also fulfill the mitzvah of eating in such a sukkah. He quotes a number of passages from which one might infer that he may.
</i> [even] on the holiday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The latter term refers to the first day of Sukkot - and in the Diaspora, the second day - and the day of Shemini Atzeret, when the laws prohibiting work and the Rabbinic ordinances extending those restrictions must be observed.
</i>.<br>The above applies when one employs the person as a wall without his conscious knowledge. However, it is forbidden to create [a wall by using a person]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explain that this refers only to the third wall of the sukkah. If a sukkah has three kosher walls, a person may employ a colleague to serve as the fourth wall on the holiday, even though the latter is conscious of what he is doing. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 630:12) states this as halachah.
</i> when the latter is conscious of the fact on the holiday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:23 states:

It is permitted to create a barrier of men, one standing next to the other, on the Sabbath, as long as the people who are standing are not conscious of the fact that they are serving as a barrier.

Although it is forbidden to create an enclosure on the Sabbath, since the person serving as the barrier is unaware of what he is doing, no transgression is involved. It is his intention, and not that of the person using the sukkah, which is significant (Ra'avad). In contrast, when the person serving as the wall is conscious of his acts, it is considered as if he has created a structure of substance (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 630:19).
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (ibid.) also states that leniency is granted only when humans serve as the walls. It is absolutely forbidden to create a wall using an animal on the holiday.
</i>. Nevertheless, it is permitted during the other days of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> with the exception of the Sabbath; i.e., there is no essential difficulty with the use of such a sukkah, the only problem is the Rabbinic prohibition mentioned above.
</i>.<br>Similarly, a person may create a fourth wall<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since a sukkah is kosher when it possesses only three walls, the addition of the fourth wall is not halachically significant. We are allowed to add to a temporary structure on the Sabbath.
</i> from utensils on the holiday. However, he should not create a third wall using utensils on the holiday, because, [by doing so], he is making the sukkah fit for use, and it is forbidden to create [even] a temporary tent on the holiday.","from utensils on the festival. However, he should not create a third wall using utensils"," It is permitted to create a utensil from human beings, because one does not normally create an enclosure in such a manner. In contrast, an enclosure is frequently made from utensils (Rabbenu Manoach).

According to the <i>Or Sameach</i>, who maintains that a gentile cannot cause property belonging to a Jew to become forbidden, this law can be explained as follows: Although the gentile's actions would not generally cause the brick to become forbidden, since the Jew indicated his desire to worship the brick, we assume that he is pleased with the gentile's act. Therefore, it becomes forbidden.
According to the <i>Beit Yosef's</i> opinion (see <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145), which maintains that a gentile can cause a Jew's property to become forbidden, this passage teaches us that the Jew's act is considered sufficient to cause the brick to become forbidden.

Because the question is left unresolved, the Rambam follows the more severe view.

The Kessef Mishneh emphasizes that the two interpretations are not contradictory and both are halachically applicable.
</i>",for definitely it was taken by a weasel or mouse," The rodent may have eaten the chametz or removed it from the premises entirely. Nevertheless, a new search is required, for it is also possible that some chametz was left within the house (<i>Pesachim</i> 9a).
As mentioned in Halachot 2 and 3, according to Torah law we need not do anything more than negate our ownership over our chametz. Nevertheless, the Sages also required that we search for chametz and destroy it completely. However, when a person does not nullify his chametz, the obligation to search takes on the severity of a Torah commandment.
This and the following halachot (8 through 13) deal with circumstances which raise questions whether a second search is required. Throughout these halachot, the Rambam makes no mention of whether the owner of the house previously nullified his chametz or not. This fact is extremely important, for different principles apply to an obligation required by Torah law from those that apply to one instituted by the Rabbis. Indeed, other Rabbinic authorities (some of whom are quoted in the commentaries to the various halachot) devote much attention to this issue, clarifying at length whether the laws apply:

a) only when a person had already nullified (or can still nullify) his chametz, or;
b) even when the search for chametz is required by Torah law.

Since the Rambam does not explicitly state his opinion on this matter, it is impossible to be sure which perspective he adopts. However, when the chapter is considered in its entirety, it appears that these halachot describe a situation where chametz has already been nullified. Unless specified to the contrary, this should be assumed to be the case. Nevertheless, certain of the leniencies are also applicable even when the search takes on the severity of a Torah obligation.

The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision, maintaining that one should recite the blessing only before partaking of a meal in the sukkah. This reflects the decision of the Ashkenazic authorities, who maintain that though the performance of all one's activities in the sukkah is a mitzvah, it is not customary to recite the blessing except when eating.

Hence, the blessing is not recited until one sits down, because previously it is not obvious that one wants to perform a significant activity in the sukkah.
The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision, maintaining that one should recite the blessing only before partaking of a meal in the sukkah. This reflects the decision of the Ashkenazic authorities, who maintain that though the performance of all one's activities in the sukkah is a mitzvah, it is not customary to recite the blessing except when eating. When reciting the blessing on that occasion, one should intend to include all other activities. (See <i>Tur</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:8.)

[Blessed are You...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to dwell in the sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that there is no limit to the number of times one recites the blessing each day. Nevertheless, if one left the sukkah for a brief interval or left with the intent of performing an activity which would improve the sukkah, that departure is not considered an interruption and no blessing is required upon one's return.

On the first night of the festival, one should first recite the blessing on the sukkah, and then the blessing for the occasion<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i>, which thanks God for enabling us to reach this occasion. This blessing is recited whenever one performs a mitzvah that can be fulfilled only from time to time (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:9).
That halachah and, similarly, <i>Sukkah</i> 46a, imply that, at the outset, one should recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> upon construction of the sukkah. Though the Rambam makes no mention of that concept here, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 641:1) states that one should have the construction of the sukkah in mind when reciting <i>shehecheyanu</i> at night.

(See <i>Bnei Binyamin</i>.)
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though one might presume that <i>shehecheyanu</i> would be recited first, since it is more frequent, precedence is given to <i>leishev basukkah</i>, because it is ""the mitzvah of the day"" (Rabbenu Manoach).

However, regarding obligations of a Rabbinic nature, one may opt towards leniency. Since the mitzvah is required by the Torah, even a person in doubt must perform it. However, the blessing is a Rabbinic requirement; hence, there is no necessity in reciting it. Furthermore, by reciting the blessing when one is not required, one uses God's name in vain.
This perspective is not accepted by all authorities. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Ashkenazic practice is to allow women and others who are not obligated in the performance of a mitzvah to recite a blessing when fulfilling it.
The above applies only regarding the doubts concerning the obligations of a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i>. However, on Shemini Atzeret, when there is a doubt concerning the obligation of the entire Jewish people even the Ashkenazic authorities would agree that a blessing should not be recited.

Torah Study 1.1,Talmud Torah - Chapter 1,"Women, slaves, and minors are free from the obligation of Torah study. Nevertheless, a father is obligated to teach his son Torah while he is a minor, as [Deuteronomy 11:19] states: ""And you shall teach them to your sons to speak about them.""<br>A woman is not obligated to teach her son, for only those who are obligated to learn are obligated to teach.","Women - <i>Kiddushin</i> 29b derives this concept from the use of the term <i>bineichem</i> - implying one's male offspring - in Deuteronomy 11:19, the verse which commands us to teach Torah to our children.

<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:14) quotes this law, but also states that women are obligated to study the laws pertaining to all the mitzvot that they are required to fulfill. (See also <i>Agur, Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2; <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i>, Introduction; and <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> 313.) This includes a large number of mitzvot - e.g., Shabbat, Niddah, and Kashrut - to the extent that many men would be proud if their Torah knowledge encompassed these areas. Furthermore, women are also obligated to perform ""spiritual"" mitzvot - e.g., to love God, fear Him, and believe in Him. Thus, they must also study those aspects of Torah which relate to these commandments. See also Halachah 13 and its commentary.

This verse emphasizes the fundamental connection a Jew has to Torah. As soon as an heir is born, he becomes the legal owner of the inheritance left to him. Thus, since the Torah is every Jew's inheritance, as soon as a child is born he acquires his full share. (See also Chapter 3, Halachah 1.)

The <i>Menorat HaMaor</i> and Rashi (Deuteronomy 11:19  emphasize that the child need not understand the verses he is reciting.

The latter can be interpreted to mean ""after completing five years"" - i.e., at the beginning of the sixth year. However, the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> (Positive Commandment 12) interprets the injunction from <i>Avot</i> to mean that when the child becomes five, his father teaches him to read at home, and when he becomes six or seven, he is taken to school. It is also possible to interpret the Rambam's words in this fashion.
[Indeed, that interpretation is more likely. Thought the above mentioned mishnah states: ""at eighteen, one should marry,"" the Rambam (<i>Hilchut Ishut</i> 15:2) states a man is obligated to marry at the age of seventeen.

In his responsum, the Rambam mentions that this halachah applies only to a house, as explicitly mentioned in the Talmud and not necessarily to a synagogue. However, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) quotes the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 251a), which requires a synagogue to have 12 windows, which correspond to the 12 <i>seraphim</i> in the Heavenly Court. He also quotes this law in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:4).
Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 34b) explains that windows are an aid to concentration, as one looks heavenward and is humbled. Rabbenu Yonah suggests that the light has a calming effect, allowing one to concentrate on his prayers.

Abraham is mentioned because, as can be inferred from Genesis 19:27, he had a fixed place for prayer.
The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 4:4, states that even in a synagogue, a person should have a fixed place for prayer and should not move from place to place.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 90:19 quotes this law. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> adds that within four cubits (approx. six feet) of one's place is also considered acceptable, since it is impossible to be in exactly the same spot at all times. Therefore, a person who finds a colleague sitting in one's place in the synagogue, may pray within four cubits of his place. This is preferable to embarrassing the person sitting in his seat, who might very well be a visitor and not be aware of which seats are occupied by regular congregants.
</i>. One should not pray in a destroyed building<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah is derived within the context of the following narrative (<i>Berachot</i> 3a):
Rabbi Yossi said: Once I was walking on the road and I entered one of the destroyed buildings of Jerusalem in order to pray. Eliyahu [the Prophet] of blessed memory came and waited for me by the entrance until I had finished praying.<br>
After I finished my prayer, he greeted me: ""Peace unto you, Rebbe.""<br>
I replied to him: ""Peace unto you, Rebbe and teacher.""<br>
He asked me: ""My son, why did you enter this destroyed building?""<br>
I answered him: ""To pray.""<br>
He told me: ""You should have prayed in the road.""
The Talmud mentions that one should never enter a destroyed building on any account. Nevertheless, since the Talmud made this statement regarding Rabbi Yossi's prayer, the Rambam teaches the laws concerning destroyed buildings here in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i>, nor [should one pray] behind a synagogue, unless he turns his face towards the synagogue.<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 6b states: ""Anyone praying behind a synagogue is called wicked,... this applies only when he faces away from the synagogue, but if he faces the synagogue there is no problem.""
Rashi (in <i>Berachot</i> 6b) states that by facing away from the synagogue when one prays, one appears to deny God who is worshiped within. Therefore, even if facing the synagogue requires one to turn away from Jerusalem, it is desirable.
<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Eruvin</i> 18b, explains that this refers to a person standing on the side of the door facing away from the synagogue, and thus towards the opposite direction of those worshipping inside. Therefore, he must simply turn the other way and solve the problem. <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> suggests that “behind a synagogue” may even refer to standing on the side of the synagogue and looking away.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:7) mentions all these possibilities and rules that one should refrain from praying in any of these places.
</i>t is forbidden to sit down next to someone in the midst of the <i>Amidah</i> or to pass in front of him, except at a distance of four cubits.",It is forbidden to sit down next to someone in the midst of the Amidah," <i>Berachot</i> 31b refers to Chanah's prayers for a son and her subsequent remarks to Eli, the priest: ""I am the woman who stood here with you"" (I Samuel 1:26 . This verses indicates that Eli, as well as Chanah, was standing at the time.
Rabbenu Yonah also mentions that this applies only to a person sitting idly, but one studying or reciting the <i>Shema</i> need not worry and may continue to sit.

Those working for daily wages are in effect paid by the hour and must use their time for their employer in the fullest manner possible.

The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 2:6, restricts the application of this Halachah. According to one version, the limitation exists only to יחיד על הציבור (an individual who is praying on behalf of the community). Another version states יחיד בציבור (an individual in a congregation).

One of the explanations offered by the Talmud for his behavior is that there was a stone floor in front of Rav, but not in front of the other congregants.

Rav Kapach mentions two possible extensions of the difference of opinion between the Rambam and the Ra'avad:
a) paper or carton - According to the Rambam, it may not be used because it no longer resembles a plant produced from the earth. According to the Ra'avad, it might be acceptable, since it is not subject to contracting ritual impurity.
b) cotton wool - It may be used for the purposes mentioned by the Ra'avad and thus, according to his opinion, would be subject to contracting ritual impurity. Nevertheless, its natural form is preserved. Hence, according to the Rambam's opinion, it would be acceptable. (It must be noted that the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 629:3 and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 629:5 maintain that after cotton has been combed, it is considered as though its form has been altered.)

It appears that the Rambam uses the same expression, but with different implications. Since he explicitly states that the sukkah must be constructed for the purpose of shade, one might infer that the expression ""according to law"" is intended to include other concepts. Thus, it can be a reference to the requirements for a sukkah's size and the nature of the materials used for the <i>s'chach</i>, as mentioned in this and the previous chapter.

An old sukkah: The School of Shammai deems it unacceptable, while the School of Hillel rules it kosher.

The commentaries explain that the term ""an old sukkah"" refers to any sukkah that was constructed for purposes other than the fulfillment of the mitzvah.
In its discussion of this law, the Jerusalem Talmud requires that one must make an addition or change to the <i>s'chach</i>. Though that decision is not quoted by the Rambam, Rabbenu Asher mentions it and it is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 636:1). Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 636:1 explains that this is a desirable and proper step, but the sukkah is acceptable even though no changes have been made.
</i>. However, it must be made for the purpose of shade<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Isaiah 4:6 states: ""It shall be a sukkah for shade from the heat...,"" thus defining the purpose of such a structure. A sukkah constructed for the purposes of modesty is not acceptable (Rabbenu Manoach).
</i>. Examples of this are sukkot made for gentiles, sukkot made for animals, and the like<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which are outside the entire framework of mitzvot. <i>Sukkah</i> 8b also mentions the sukkot made for shepherds and watchmen. Though the latter are obligated to keep the mitzvah of sukkah, they did not necessarily construct their sukkot with that intent in mind.
</i>.<br>In contrast, a sukkah that came about on its own accord<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., branches fell over a frame, and of course, any time a roof is covered for other purposes - e.g., the construction of a home, as mentioned in the previous halachah...
</i> is unacceptable, because it was not made for the purpose of shade.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i> Similarly, when a person hollows out a place in a heap of produce and thus makes a sukkah, it is not considered to be a sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkot</i> 12a explains that there is an added factor involved in this example. Deuteronomy 16:13 states: ""Make a [celebration of] the Sukkot holiday for seven days."" This refers to the construction of the sukkah and teaches that we must ""make"" a sukkah and not use what was already made. Therefore, despite the fact that the person hollowed out the space for the purpose of shade, the sukkah is not acceptable, because the produce was not originally placed there for that purpose.
We find a similar principle concerning <i>tzitzit</i>. Deuteronomy 22:12 states: ""Make yourself tassels on the four corners of your garments."" On the basis of this command, <i>Menachot</i> 40b teaches that it is unacceptable to tie <i>tzitzit</i> to a three-cornered garment and then cut a fourth corner, since we are required to make <i>tzitzit</i>, and not use what is already made.
</i>, because the produce was not piled there for this purpose. Accordingly, were one to create a space one handbreadth [high] and seven [handbreadths] in area for the purpose of a sukkah, and afterwards hollow it out till it reached ten [handbreadths], it is kosher, since its <i>s'chach</i> was placed for the purpose of shade.",for the produce was not piled there for this purpose," The <i>Ba'al Hamaor</i> writes that if, originally, a person were to pile produce with the intention that later he would hollow out a sukkah, the sukkah would be acceptable. However, this opinion is not accepted by other authorities.

The Top Of A Date-Palm

Small bundles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the reason for the addition of the adjective, noting that if the bundles contain fewer than twenty five units, they are permitted, as stated in the previous halachah. Others mention that this refers to bundles of small branches.
</i> that were tied together [to be sold] by number<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to be untied immediately thereafter (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 629:16).
</i> may be used as <i>s'chach</i>.<br>S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 13b relates that bundles of this nature were frequently used in Sura, and that the Sages permitted them to be used as <i>s'chach</i>.
</i>imilarly, if one cuts off the top of a date palm and the branches are bound to it, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>, because elements that are bound naturally are not considered to be bundles. Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side, and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>. A single tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together naturally.<br>Similarly, any knot which is not strong enough to hold when carried is not considered a knot [and the resulting bundle may be used as <i>s'chach</i>].","Similarly, if one cuts off the top of a date palm and the branches are bound to it, it may be used as s'chach, because elements that are bound naturally are not considered to be bundles"," The <i>Ba'al Hamaor</i> questions whether this principle applies only with regard to <i>s'chach</i>, where it is logical to assume that a more lenient position would be taken, since the entire question revolves around a Rabbinic decree, or whether it also applies in all cases where Torah law itself requires a bundle.

Small bundles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the reason for the addition of the adjective, noting that if the bundles contain fewer than twenty five units, they are permitted, as stated in the previous halachah. Others mention that this refers to bundles of small branches.
</i> that were tied together [to be sold] by number<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to be untied immediately thereafter (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 629:16).
</i> may be used as <i>s'chach</i>.<br>S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Ba'al Hamaor</i> questions whether this principle applies only with regard to <i>s'chach</i>, where it is logical to assume that a more lenient position would be taken, since the entire question revolves around a Rabbinic decree, or whether it also applies in all cases where Torah law itself requires a bundle.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 13b relates that bundles of this nature were frequently used in Sura, and that the Sages permitted them to be used as <i>s'chach</i>.
</i>imilarly, if one cuts off the top of a date palm and the branches are bound to it, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>, because elements that are bound naturally are not considered to be bundles. Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side, and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>. A single tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together naturally.<br>Similarly, any knot which is not strong enough to hold when carried is not considered a knot [and the resulting bundle may be used as <i>s'chach</i>].","Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as s'chach. A tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together naturally"," However, if one were to add even one branch and then tie them together, it would be considered to be a bundle (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 629:15).

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.12","Shofar, Sukkah, vLulav - Chapter 5","A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his home<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the sukkah is unacceptable. This applies only when the shade the tree produces exceeds the open area. However, if there is more open space under the tree than shade, the sukkah may be kosher.
The determination of whether such a sukkah is kosher depends on a number of principles, based on the interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 9b and 11a. The Rambam's interpretation of that passage, and thus the ground rules he establishes, differ from those accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1-2).
In the following halachah, the Rambam deals with the resolution of the question when no effort has been made to correct the problem of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>. As will be explained, there his interpretation is contested by other authorities. In this halachah, the Rambam describes the rulings which govern the situation when an effort has been made to rectify the situation by detaching the branches from their source of nurture. These are based on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 11a, and are also accepted by other Rabbinic authorities. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:2.)

Otherwise, it is unacceptable even though steps were taken to correct the disqualifying factors. This is based on the principle that one must make a sukkah and not use one which is already made.

Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, notes the apparent contradiction between this decision and Halachah 3, which states:

[When one uses] branches from a fig tree which contain figs,...We see if the waste is more than the food; then we may use them as <i>s'chach</i>.

Rav Avraham distinguishes between the two. In Halachah 3, the person does not intend to use the fruit for the purpose of shade; he merely wants to save the effort of removing it from the branches. Therefore, their presence may be nullified. In contrast, in this halachah the substances which are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> are being employed for the purpose of shade itself.

That passage reads:

A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his home...
Ravva said: ""The above applies only to a tree whose shade is greater than its open space. However, if its open space is greater than its shade, it is kosher.
What difference does it make if its open space is greater than its shade, the substance not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> will be combined with the kosher <i>s'chach</i> [and therefore, the sukkah will not be acceptable]?
Rav Pappa said: בשחבטן.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, the Ra'avad, and Rabbenu Manoach explain that the Rambam renders בשחבטן as ""when he separated them."" Thus, when the two substances were combined, the Rambam's opinion would be that the sukkah is not kosher, as explained in this clause of the halachah. When they are separate, the sukkah may be kosher according to the stipulations mentioned in the following clause of this halachah and the halachot to come.
(The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam renders בשחבטן as ""when he severed them."" However, that difference in interpretation does not result in a difference in halachah.)
Rashi and others interpret בשחבטן as ""when he lowered them (and mixed them together with the kosher <i>s'chach</i>)."" Thus, according to this opinion, the sukkah is acceptable when the kosher and non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> are mixed together. Thus, this view is diametrically opposed to the Rambam's, who maintains that such a mixture is of no avail.
As noted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1), there are two ways of understanding this interpretation of the passage. However, since both of them are not acceptable to the Rambam, their explanation will not be included here.

If there is less than that amount, we view it as though the wall has been made crooked - i.e., the substance that is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is considered part of the wall a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Nissim states that this law applies only when the walls reach all the way to the <i>s'chach</i>. Otherwise, it is impossible to consider the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> to be an extension of the walls. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Taz</i> quote more lenient positions and allow such a sukkah, even though the walls do not reach the <i>s'chach</i>.
</i>nd it is kosher. This concept is a halachah received by Moses on Mount Sinai.",and it is kosher," Though the sukkah as a whole is kosher, one may not eat or sleep under the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> if it is four handbreadths or more in size (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.). The rationale behind this decision is that the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> is considered to be part of the wall and not part of the <i>s'chach</i>.

In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam emphasizes that the word ""equivalent"" should be interpreted loosely, since there must be more kosher <i>s'chach</i> than the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>.

Blessings 3.10,Berachot - Chapter 3,"Before eating rice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this halachah, we have translated אורז as ""rice"" and דוחן as ""millet,"" based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shvi'it</i> 2:7. There is, however, debate concerning this manner among the halachic authorities. Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 37a) and the Maharil interpret אורז as ""millet."" With respect to these opinions, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 208:9 and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 208:11 suggest partaking of rice or millet only in the midst of a meal including bread. If either are eaten separately, the blessing <i>shehakol</i> should be recited beforehand because of the doubt involved.
In contrast, the <i>Sha'ar Tziyun</i> 208:31 rules that the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited before partaking of rice.

This applies only when no other ingredients are combined together with the rice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, the law regarding rice differs from that regarding cooked foods made from the five grains. As explained in Halachot 4-6, although quantitatively a food may contain a mixture of other ingredients, as long as the grain was intended to add flavor to the food, it is considered the primary ingredient. In contrast, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> is recited on a mixture of rice and other foods only when rice is quantitatively the primary element of the mixture. See <i>Shulchan Aruch (</i>14Orach Chayim13 208:7).
The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 208:9, however, maintains that the Rambam's words should be interpreted literally. Thus, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited only when rice is prepared by itself and not when eaten in combination with even a minority of other foods.

</i> the miracles and wonders wrought for our ancestors in Egypt on the night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.), the Rambam states ""the beginning of the night,"" implying that we should begin telling the story of the Exodus in the first portion of the night.
</i> of the fifteenth of Nisan<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the night of the plague of the firstborn, when Pharaoh gave the Jews permission to leave Egypt.
</i>, as [Exodus 13:3] states: ""Remember this day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the fifteenth of Nisan
</i>, on which you left Egypt<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> implying that we are commanded to commemorate the day of the Exodus.
</i>,"" just as [Exodus 20:8] states: ""Remember the Sabbath day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This addition is a quote from the <i>Mechiltah</i> and <i>Shemot Rabbah</i>. Nevertheless, the commentators have questioned its necessity. Some explain that the word זכור does not follow the grammatical form usually used for commandments, and hence the comparison with the Sabbath is valuable.
<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 21, explains that <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> states that the remembrance of the Sabbath is זכר למעשה בראשית, ""a commemoration of the work of creation."" The remembrance of the exodus, it continues, must also emphasize the wonders and miracles that God performed.
What is the common point between the Sabbath and the exodus? Both emphasize how God is above nature and, hence, can change nature according to His will.
This quality is also reflected in our service. At the very beginning of <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how the observance of the Sabbath is connected with a positive mitzvah: rest. A Jew steps beyond his weekday activities and devotes his energies to spiritual activites bond with God.
Similarly, the recollection of the exodus from Egypt must take us beyond our everyday activities to the extent that as stated in Halachah 7:6 ""He presents himself as if he, himself, is leaving the slavery of Egypt.""
</i>.""<br>From where [is it derived that this mitzvah is to be fulfilled on] the night of the fifteenth? The Torah teaches [Exodus 13:8]: ""And you shall tell your son on that day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> relating the story of the Exodus
</i>, saying: 'It is because of this<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mechiltah</i> interprets this as a reference to matzah and maror. Thus, the verse is
</i>...' [implying that the mitzvah i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> of relating the story of the exile

Whoever elaborates concerning the events which occurred and took place is worthy of praise.",[is to be fulfilled] when matzah and maror are placed before you," i.e., on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan, when it is a mitzvah to eat matzah, as explained in Halachah 6:1.

It is curious that the Rambam does not mention whether wine should be given to children below Bar-Mitzvah age. Many authorities maintain that it is unnecessary for the Rambam to mention this fact, for we can assume that the all-encompassing obligation to educate one's children in Torah practice applies in this regard as well. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 472:15 and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 472:25)
Other commentaries, however, maintain that the omission is significant. They note that in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 4:12, the Rambam writes that wine is harmful to young children.

the four exiles in which the Jews will suffer;
the four cups of retribution God will force the gentiles to drink in the Messianic age; and,

See also the Ramban (<i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i>), who mentions an opinion that the shofar, and not a trumpet, should be sounded in time of communal distress. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also notes this opinion and states that either instrument, a shofar or a trumpet, is acceptable, but that - outside of the Temple premises - only one of the two should be used in time of distress.

We are commanded to sound the trumpets in the Temple when offering sacrifices that are offered only at appointed times.... [Also,] we are commanded to sound the trumpets at a time of distress and difficulty when we pray to Him.

In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (and similarly in <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 384), the emphasis of the mitzvah is clearly on the sounding of the trumpets during the sacrifices. In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, when listing the 613 mitzvot at the beginning of the text, the Rambam mentions the sounding of the trumpets both for the sacrifices and in times of distress. Nevertheless, further on in the beginning of the text, when delineating the mitzvot according to subjects, he places the emphasis on crying out to God at a time of distress (seemingly, including crying out verbally and crying out with the trumpets in the same mitzvah). Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 3, where the Rambam mentions the practice of sounding the trumpets in connection with the offering of the sacrifices, he does not mention it as a component of this or any other specific mitzvah.
(Note also the commentary of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, which questions why these two different rites were included as a single mitzvah at the outset. Even in the Torah, they are included in two separate verses.)

See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:2-4. Significantly, although in practice, both types of notes were sounded, with regard to the sounding of the trumpets at the offerings, the Torah uses the verb ותקעתם, which refers to sounding a <i>teki'ah</i>, a single long note.

Nor is its observance dependent on the existence of the Temple, nor does the Rambam specify that it must be fulfilled only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (In this regard, there are differing opinions; see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:1) Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:1 questions: Why is the rite of sounding the trumpets (or shofarot) not observed at present?
The resolution of this question lies in the Rambam's words, ""any difficulty that arises which affects the community."" This rite should not be observed when an individual, or even a group of individuals, are in distress, but only when a ""community"" is affected.
<i>Pesachim</i> 54b explains that communal fasts are possible only within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There is no concept of taking such a unified communal act of this nature in the diaspora. Therefore, this mitzvah was not relevant in all the generations of our people's existence in the diaspora. (See also the <i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i> of the Ramban.)
A question arises, however, with regard to the situation at present, with the renewal of the Jewish settlement in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 11, there are opinions (see the gloss of the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> to the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575) that maintain that at present, the concept of community also applies in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
According to this view, without entering into the discussion regarding the halachic status of the present government, it would appear that it would be proper for this mitzvah to be observed, since its observance is not dependent on the Temple.

Nevertheless, <i>Ta'anit</i> 8b gives advice regarding such a situation as well, counselling one to vow to fast in the future.

Although a community may observe a fast on some of these days, as stated in Halachah 7, an individual may not. (See also Halachah 12.)
Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, which raises questions about this decision, citing <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:9, where the Rambam states:

If a person vowed to fast for several days, and those days included Chanukah and Purim, his vow is nullified and he should not fast. [The celebration of] these days was instituted by the Rabbis, and hence, it should be reinforced.

One might infer that on the other days that should be celebrated because of the Torah's decree, a vow to fast takes precedence. Some commentaries, however, differentiate between a vow to fast and a commitment to fast made in the afternoon service of the preceding day, as mentioned in the following halachah. In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 578:1) rules that one should not fast on these days.

Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 288:5) explains that at present, it is customary to fast on the Sabbath only for certain disturbing dreams, since we are not as aware of the proper interpretation of dreams as were the Sages of the previous generations.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that although the Ra'avad's rationale is generally applicable, if - in fact - the distressing situation passes before noon, the fast may be halted.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also states two reasons for the difference between an individual fast and a communal fast:
a) Leniency was granted to the community because of the greater scale of the difficulty involved in such a fast;
b) When the court called the communal fast, it had in mind that were the community's prayers to be answered, the fast could be terminated.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 569:1) rules that if the Torah scholars and the majority of the members of the community desire to continue the fast, all the members of the community are obligated to abide by their decision.

The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that even after food is completely cooked, one should not stir it.

If, by contrast, one put down the pot, another came - According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this is the key phrase in understanding the difference between the first clause and the second.

Accordingly, since the actions of the persons mentioned first could not bring about cooking in their own right, they are not held liable.

</i> and his son, Solomon<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> who built the Temple and added to the blessing instituted by his father, acknowledgement of ""the great and holy house on which Your name is called"" (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).
There is a slight difficulty with these statements. The first three blessings are considered to have been instituted by the Torah. If so, how can the authorship of the latter two of them be attributed to Joshua, David, and Solomon, who lived in later generations?
The Ramban in his <i>Hasagot</i> explains that, although the fundamental obligation to recite these blessings originates in the Torah, the basic form of the text of these blessings was ordained by each of these prophets in his time. Beforehand, each person would recite the grace in his own words. (See also the commentary on the following halachah.)
The Ramban also explains that, after the destruction of the Temple, a prayer that it be rebuilt was included in the third blessing. In this context, it is also worthy to question whether Ezra and the Men of the Great Assembly also made any changes in the grace when they arranged all the prayers and blessings, as mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 5 and commentary. (See <i>Kochba d'Shavit</i>.)
</i>; and the fourth by the Sages of the <i>Mishnah</i>.",and the fourth by the Sages of the <i>Megillah</i>," <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates that the Sages instituted this blessing on the day the Romans granted permission for the dead of Beitar to be buried. This city had served as the capital of Bar Kochba's revolt against Rome and had exacted a heavy toll of legionnaires while making a valiant defense. When the city finally fell, the Romans slew hundreds of thousands mercilessly, the extent of the carnage staggering all chroniclers. As a further measure of punishment to its inhabitants, they refused to allow them to be buried.
Years passed before such permission was granted. When the Romans finally granted the Sages permission to bury these people, they were amazed at the wondrous miracle their eyes beheld. The corpses had remained whole. They had neither rotted, nor been eaten by predators. In appreciation of this Divine kindness, the Sages instituted this blessing, praising God for being ""good"" (for preventing them from rotting) and ""doing good"" (for allowing the corpses to be buried).

These three, however, are unique in that they refer to the establishment of a covenant regarding the bond between the Jews and the Torah.<br>
1. <i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions both these possibilities. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam quotes the former expression.<br>
2. The beginning of a blessing must share the same theme as its conclusion. Nevertheless, the rebuilding of Jerusalem shares a connection with God's showing mercy to the people of Israel, since the rebuilding of Jerusalem is an expression of God's mercy to the Jewish people (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>
3. Although <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that two different concepts should not be mentioned in the conclusion of a blessing, this version of the blessing does not contradict that rule. The intent is a single request that Israel be granted the ultimate comfort, the rebuilding of Jerusalem.<br>
4. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 48b, mentions another reason for the mention of the House of David. It was David who conquered Jerusalem and established the holiness of the city.<br>
 5. Since an integral element of our celebration of the Sabbath and festivals is eating festive meals, the sacred element of the day should be mentioned in the grace recited after partaking of those meals. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the day does not require a blessing in its own right, nor is it made the essential element of the third blessing. Therefore, one begins and concludes that blessing in the same manner as is done during the week (Rashi, <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 48b).<br>
6. The order in which these alternatives are mentioned in this halachah is the reverse of that mentioned in the previous halachah. It can be explained that in the previous halachah, the Rambam mentioned the text he considered most appropriate first. The order he mentions in this halachah, however, is closer to the expression used by our Sages in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this halachah.<br>
7. Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. With regard to Rosh HaShanah, see the commentary on Halachah 13.<br>
8. <i>Shabbat</i> 24a explains that since an additional sacrifice (<i>korban musaf</i>) is offered on these days, they possess an element of sanctity that is worthy of mention. As obvious from the contrast of Halachah 12 to Halachah 13, however, there is a difference between the obligation to mention these days and the obligation to mention Sabbaths and festivals.<br>
 9. Since Chanukah and Purim are Rabbinic holidays which are not associated with an additional sacrificial offering, they are not mentioned in the third blessing. The second blessing is more appropriate for the mention of the miracles of these holidays, since it is an expression of thanks to God (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a).
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> note that from <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it would appear that while permission is granted to mention Chanukah and Purim in the second blessing, it is not an obligation to do so. In contrast, the Rambam requires that they be mentioned. They explain that since the Sages of the Talmud were wont to mention these holidays in grace, and the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 7:6) considers their mention a binding obligation, the Rambam established their mention as a requirement. See also Halachah 13 and commentary.<br>
10. Precedence is given to the Sabbath because it occurs more frequently than the festivals and is on a higher spiritual level (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>
 11. ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, 16King13 of the Universe, the God, who is our Father and our 16King13... the 16King13 who is good."" The reason for this stress on God's sovereignty in this blessing is that the blessing recited previously mentions the sovereignty of the House of David, and the Sages wanted to emphasize how all earthly kings are subordinate to a higher authority (<i>Berachot</i> 49a).<br>
12. The blessing mentioned is quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46a. That source also contains additions to the blessing that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi would recite.<br>
 13. The Rambam's words are quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46b, which relates that Mar Zutra recited this blessing.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 379:14) relates that this blessing should be recited throughout the seven days of mourning by the mourners and by all who recite grace together with him when there is a <i>zimun</i>. Other opinions (based on <i>Ketubot</i> 8a) state that this blessing should be recited only when ten people recite grace together. The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 207:7 writes that it is Ashkenazic custom to rely on this opinion, and hence, this blessing is generally not recited.<br>
14. <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates several additions Mar Zutra made on the above occasion.<br>
15. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam includes several requests beginning with the word <i>Harachaman</i> (May the Merciful One...) in his text of grace. These requests were additions to the grace made by the Geonim, who lived in the era subsequent to the Talmud.<br>
 16. This refers to the final blessing quoted in Halachah 11.<br>
17. <i>Nisu'in</i> (marriage) is marked by the entry of a bride and groom into a private chamber together. This ceremony is referred to as <i>chuppah</i> and is accompanied by a celebration. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 10, and commentaries.
As mentioned at the conclusion of the following halachah, according to the Rambam this blessing is recited only when ten adult males are present. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:4) differs and maintains that it should be recited even when fewer than ten people are present. Note the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:7) who states that today this blessing is never recited alone. If ""new faces"" - people who had not attended the wedding celebrations previously - are present, all seven blessings are recited. If no ""new faces"" are present (although ten males are), the meal is considered like a meal eaten by the bridegroom alone, and the blessing is not recited.<br>
18. The same laws applying to a widow or widower apply to a person who has been divorced. Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:12, the Rambam states that even if a woman has been married before, her husband should celebrate with her for three days.<br>
19. Surely, this also applies when neither the bride nor groom have been married before. <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states: ""The Sages ordained that everyone who marries a maiden should celebrate with her for seven days.""
The differences between the time limits mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, are worthy of comparison. See the commentary on that halachah.<br>
20. <i>Ketubot</i> 8a states that after the first day of the wedding celebrations, Rav Ashi would recite the wedding blessings only when ""new faces"" were present. In his responsa, the Rambam's son states that his father required only two ""new faces."" Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 64:7 who requires only one ""new face."" The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> write that on the Sabbath the presence of new guests is not necessary, since the Sabbath itself is considered as ""guests.""<br>
21. <i>Ketubot</i> 7b derives this rule from the account of the wedding between Ruth and Boaz. Ruth 4:2 relates that Boaz invited ten men to witness the marriage.<br>
<br>
 22. Only six blessings are mentioned below; the seventh blessing is the blessing over the wine. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:4.)<br>
23. Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 7b) explains that this blessing is in praise of the creation of Adam, the first man.
In <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, where the text of the wedding blessings is repeated, this blessing follows the blessing ""who has created all things for His glory."" This order is the sequence in which these blessings are recited today. It appears more appropriate, particularly according to Rashi's commentary (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which explains that the blessing ""who has created all things..."" is not directly connected to the wedding itself, but rather is recited in appreciation of the guests who have come to celebrate together with the new couple.
[The repetition of the text of the blessings in two separate halachot, something very out of character for the Rambam in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has aroused the attention of the commentaries. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the text of the blessings here was added by the printers, and not by the Rambam himself.]<br>
24. Despite the fact that this blessing follows two (or three) blessings which begin with ""Blessed...,"" it also begins with ""Blessed...."" Among the explanations offered is that the first blessings are short, and if the line ""Blessed..."" were not mentioned, they would appear as a single blessing (<i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>
25. Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as a reference to the creation of woman, who was created from man (""his own self""), and gives him the potential for reproduction (""a structure that will last for all time"").<br>
26. ""The barren one"" refers to Jerusalem. Psalms 137:6 states: ""Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy."" Thus, at the height of the wedding celebration, we recall the holy city and pray that it be rebuilt.<br>
 27. This is a prayer that the bride and groom enjoy the happiness experienced by Adam in Eve before the first sin.
Several manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> mention a different conclusion for this blessing, ""Blessed are You, God, who brings joy to His people, Israel, and rebuilds Jerusalem."" (In this context, note the commentary of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)<br>
28. The blessing joins our wishes for the happiness of the particular couple with our hope for the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The ultimate marriage relationship is the bond between God and the Jewish people, which will be realized in the Messianic age. Thus, the two themes, marriage and redemption, share an intrinsic link.<br>
29. Rashi, <i>Ketubot</i> 8a, explains the difference between the last two blessings. The fifth of the blessings concludes with a request that the bride and groom enjoy a lifetime of happiness and success together. The sixth and final blessing concludes with a request that they find happiness in each other, that their wedding joy be extended throughout their lives. Alternatively, the final blessing is a blessing for the Jewish people as a whole who find fulfillment in married life.

In these halachot, he does not mention this prohibition in the manner in which he usually introduces one of the 613 mitzvot in this text, because he introduced this prohibition previously in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, mentioning it in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:6. The inclusion of this mitzvah in those halachot is appropriate, because it is one of the foundations of our faith.

The Torah warns us about this, saying [Deuteronomy 4:19]: ""Lest you lift your eyes heavenward and see the sun, the moon, and the stars... [and bow down and worship them], the entities which God apportioned to all the nations."" - As mentioned in the previous chapter, there are some authorities who, using this verse as a proof-text, do not prohibit gentiles from worshiping false gods with this intent. However, all authorities agree that Jews may not worship in this manner.

In contrast, the existence of the stars and the spheres remains constant.

For this reason, [Deuteronomy 11:16] commands: ""Be very careful - The words ""Be very careful"" imply a prohibition stemming from the Torah. In Halachah 3, the Rambam describes the prohibition involved in harboring such thoughts.

The Rambam explains the reason for these prohibitions:
In general, people have limited powers of understanding, and not all minds are capable of appreciating the truth in its fullness. - See also <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:12, 4:11,13, where the Rambam mentions the restrictions placed on the study of deeper spiritual concepts lest one err in his conception.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 47) defines this mitzvah as follows:
</i>.<br>In general, people have limited powers of understanding, and not all minds are capable of appreciating the truth in its fullness.

He explains that this also applies to the oral law. He reiterates this concept in his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.
</i><br>Since he may not know the guidelines with which to evaluate [ideas that will lead him] to the truth in its fullness, he may come to heresy. The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: ""Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality"" - i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth.<br>Our Sages [interpreted this warning]: ""After your hearts,"" this refers to heresy; ""after your eyes,"" this refers to immorality. This prohibition - though [severe,] causing a person to be prevented [from attaining a portion] in the world to come - is not punishable by lashes.","Since he might not know the guidelines with which to evaluate [ideas that will lead him] to the truth in its fullness, he might come to heresy"," The Rambam's statements should be interpreted, not as a restriction of one's thinking processes, but rather a call to structure our thoughts according to the guidelines provided for us by the Torah.
In this context, it is worthy to refer to <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13:
I maintain that it is not proper for a person to stroll in the <i>Pardes</i> (study Torah's mystic secrets) unless he has filled his belly with bread and meat. ""Bread and meat"" refer to the knowledge of what is permitted and what is forbidden, and similar matters concerning other mitzvot. Even though the Sages referred to these as ""a small matter"" - since our Sages said: ""'A great matter,' this is <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah</i>. 'A small matter,' this is the debates of Abbaye and Ravva"" - nevertheless, it is fitting for them to be given precedence, because they settle a person's mind.
Thus, the Rambam teaches that a person should not embark on the study of deep spiritual questions until he has gained the intellectual maturity which comes from Torah study. Even after a person gains such maturity, there is no need for him to concern himself with the study of idol worship because there is no value which he can derive from such study.
<b>The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: ""Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality"" -</b> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 47) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 387) counts this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
<b>i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth. -</b> Instead, he should follow a structured pattern for intellectual growth and development prescribed by a Torah master.
<b>Our Sages -</b> <i>Sifre, Sh'lach</i>. (See also <i>Berachot</i> 12b.)
<b>[interpreted this warning]: ""After your hearts,"" this refers to heresy -</b> For a more precise definition of the term <i>minut</i>, see Halachah 5 and the commentary.
<b>""after your eyes,"" this refers to immorality. -</b> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains:
Their intent in mentioning ""immorality"" was the pursuit of pleasure and physical desire, [to the extent that] one's mind is constantly preoccupied with such thoughts.
<b>This prohibition - though [severe,] causing a person to be prevented [from attaining a portion] in the world to come -</b> In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam includes among the categories of those who have no portion in the world to come: ""nonbelievers, heretics, those who deny the Torah,... those who cause the many to sin, and those who depart from the ways of the community."" Following the whims of one's heart can lead to the transgression of these prohibitions.
<b>is not punishable by lashes -</b> because it does not involve a deed.
There is some difficulty with the Rambam's statements. The transgression of both of the prohibitions mentioned in this halachah involves thought and can also involve deed. Just as the commentaries suggested several deeds which violate the first prohibition, similar acts could be performed which violate the latter prohibition. The Rambam, however, appears to imply that there is no way that the latter prohibition could be transgressed in a manner warranting punishment.

The Rambam's words seem to allude to a resolution of this difficulty. The miraculous lighting of the <i>Menorah</i> began on the twenty-fifth of Kislev and continued for eight days.
[Note, however, the <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 670:1), who explains that, according to the Rambam, the first day of the celebration was instituted in appreciation of the military victories, while the remaining seven came in recognition of the miracle of the <i>Menorah</i>.]

Lighting the candles on these days is a Rabbinic mitzvah, like the reading of the Megillah.",as days of happiness," an acknowledgement of God's miracles in a material context in appreciation of the military victories.
As the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Purim</i>, Chapter 2, ""happiness"" is associated with feasting. In this context, the <i>Yam shel Shlomo, Bava Kama</i> 7:37, explains that according to the Rambam - in contrast to the rulings of the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 670:2) - the festive meals customarily served on Chanukah can be considered to be feasts associated with a mitzvah.

A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Megillah</i> 17a,b equates the reading of <i>Hallel</i> with the reading of the Megillah in this respect. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)
Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 422:26, which explains that there are authorities who rule that proper sequence is required only within a particular psalm. The order of the psalms themselves, however, may be altered. This view, however, is not accepted by most authorities, and the prevailing practice is to follow their ruling.
See also <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:11, where the Rambam states that it is not absolutely necessary to read the different passages of the <i>Shema</i> in order. On the other hand, there the Rambam explains his decision, stating that the passages of the <i>Shema</i> are not found in this order in the Torah. In contrast, the psalms of <i>Hallel</i> are recited in the order they are found in the Bible.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although <i>Hallel</i> is recited directly after the morning service, it is not an integral part of the prayer service and may be recited at other times. See <i>Megillah</i> 20b, which derives an allusion to this concept from the exegesis of Psalms 118:24: ""This is the day which God wrought; let us rejoice and exult in it."" Our ""rejoicing and exultation,"" the recitation of <i>Hallel</i>, may be carried out throughout the entire day.
</i> person who reads <i>Hallel</i> in improper sequence does not fulfill his obligation. If a person reads and pauses, reads and pauses, even if he pauses for a time long enough to complete the entire [<i>Hallel</i>], he fulfills his obligation.<br>O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 34b, we can conclude that the laws that apply to the reading of the Megillah also apply to the reading of <i>Hallel</i>. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.)
As mentioned in the commentary on that halachah, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 65:1) rules that should a person be forced to refrain from completing the <i>Shema</i> because the place in which he is located contains filth, he does not fulfill his obligation if he waited the amount of time required to recite the <i>Shema</i> in its entirety. The commentaries question if this law applies with regard to the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> as well. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 422:25.)
</i>n the days when the entire <i>Hallel</i> is recited, one may make an interruption between chapters. Within a [single] chapter, however, one may not make an interruption. On the days when <i>Hallel</i> is read while skipping portions, one may make an interruption even within a chapter.",On the days when the entire Hallel is recited," the recitation of the <i>Hallel</i> has the strength of a Rabbinic commandment. Hence, the laws governing it are more severe.

b) assure the Jewish owner of receiving the goods in return, or their monetary equivalent

Rav Chayim Soloveitchik (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:1) differentiates between the two cases as follows. Chametz itself is a forbidden substance. Hence, it must be spoiled to the point that a dog cannot benefit from it. In contrast, the other substances are merely mixtures of chametz. They are only forbidden because they contain the taste of chametz. Hence, once that taste is no longer suitable for human consumption, there is no reason why they should remain forbidden.
He continues relating that, as stated in Halachot 11 and 12, chametz that is obviously designated for purposes other than food can be used even though it has not become spoiled. Thus, one could explain that once the chametz in the above mixtures becomes unfit for human consumption, it is clearly not food.

He also quotes a responsum of Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, who explicitly states that a priest may rely on his morning washing.
Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:6), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the opinion of Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Sotah</i> 39a), who require the priests to have their hands washed a second time as an additional measure of holiness.

Who should they bless? Their brethren in the north and the south - i.e., those outside the synagogue. Even though they were unable to attend the synagogue, since they were prevented by forces beyond their control, they are included within the blessing.
The Rambam's statements are taken from <i>Sotah</i> 38b and the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:4. However, the Rambam's choice of phraseology is more restrictive, mentioning only ""the people in the north and the south,"" while these sources state, ""their brethren in the fields.""
According to his grandson, Rav Yitzchak HaNagid, this restriction was intentional. Since in the Rambam's time the Jews lived mostly to the east or west of Jerusalem, in most synagogues the <i>heichal</i> would be pointed in that direction, and thus, depending on the location of the synagogue, the people standing in one of these directions would be standing behind the priests.

This does not mean a sphere which represents the sun, or a hemisphere which represents the moon, but rather the images which the astrologers [i.e., those following Greek mythology] attribute to the stars... - e.g., Saturn is represented as a dark old man of venerable age, Venus is represented as a beautiful maiden adorned with gold, and the sun is represented as a king with a diadem sitting in a chariot.

The Ramah states that since paganism is not common at present, we assume that these forms were made for artistic purposes. Hence, it is not forbidden to benefit from an article even if it contains pagan images. One may not, however, keep such an article in one's possession. He adds that even at present, certain individuals are stringent with themselves and do not benefit from an article containing the three forms mentioned above.

In contrast, the three forms mentioned above are generally made for the purpose of worship.<br>","

For example, the prohibition against eating certain forbidden foods (e.g., non-kosher meat, fats, mixtures of meat and milk) is lifted when these substances become mixed with 60 times their amount of other substances. The prohibitions against <i>terumah</i> (and any other substances which are also called <i>terumah</i>) are lifted when it becomes mixed with 100 times their amount of other substances and similarly, the prohibitions against <i>orlah</i> and <i>kilai hakerem</i> are lifted when these substances are mixed with 200 times their amount of other substances.
Because of the serious nature of the prohibition against idol worship, these principles do not apply and anything connected with it is forbidden, regardless of the proportion of the mixture the forbidden substances make up. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 5:8.)

It is, however, permissible to sit under the shade of its branches and its leaves. - This decision has been questioned by other authorities, who wonder why the Rambam distinguished between the tree's trunk and branches. On the surface, the same prohibition should apply to both of them.
The Rambam's decision is based on his interpretation of <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 48b, which is derived from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:8). The Talmud explains that even though the shade of an <i>asherah</i> is forbidden, צל הצל, literally, ""the shade of its shade,"" is permitted. The Jerusalem Talmud interprets 18לצ לצה as shade produced by the parts of the tree which would not touch the trunk if they fell.
[Rashi offers a different interpretation of <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid. His view is accepted by most commentaries. When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 142:9) does not differentiate between the shade produced by the trunk and that of its leaves.
If a person has another route - to reach his desired destination, which is no longer than the one which passes under the <i>asherah</i>. If the alternate route is longer, the person is not required to deviate from the path leading under the <i>asherah</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.).

Note, however, the Ramah's statements (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, ibid.), which permit one to pass under the <i>asherah's</i> shade, though not under the tree itself. According to his opinion, the prohibition stems from the impurity of idol worship.

Nevertheless, since there is no great difficulty in running for this short distance, the Rambam imposes this stringency on all people (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>","

The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> (and the <i>Turei Zahav, Yoreh De'ah</i> 142:12) explain that climbing on the tree or using it as support for a ladder would involve deriving benefit from the forbidden tree.
The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Me'ilah</i> 3:9, suggests a different interpretation. There, the Rambam specifically writes that when taking the nest - as stated in the final clause of this halachah - it permissible to climb up the tree in the normal manner. Therefore, it appears that one should knock down the chicks to see if they are capable of flying on their own or not. This explanation also clarifies why the Rambam does not mention in this halachah the need to knock down the chicks.

The coals and the heat produced by the initial fire, however, are not forbidden and one may bake with them. He does not make such statements here, because, as stated in Halachah 10, even the coals and ashes of an <i>asherah</i> are forbidden.
[Curiously, when mentioning these laws in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (142:4), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, substituting forbidden wood for <i>orlah</i>, without distinguishing between the different prohibitions. Accordingly the commentaries on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 145:5, <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 145:10) object to his decision.]

The Mishnah states that if such wood is used in a new oven, the oven may never be used again. In Talmudic times, the ovens were made of clay and the clay would not harden sufficiently until the oven was kindled once. Thus, since kindling the oven for the first time prepared it to be used on all subsequent occasions, some Rabbis forbade its use when this first kindling was made with a forbidden substance. This opinion is, nevertheless, not accepted as halachah. The Rambam's view is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i>, ibid. (See the explanation of זה וזה גורם in the following halachah.)
Furthermore, this prohibition is extended beyond the oven:

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.3,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 7,"When a person awakes after concluding his sleep<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., in the morning when he has completed his night's sleep.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> points out that although <i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one recites this blessing upon arising, the Rambam specifies that it be said only after concluding one's sleep. This makes it clear that a person who wakes up in the middle of the night and intends to return to sleep, need not recite this blessing.
</i>, while still in bed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Yonah (in his commentary to the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchok Alfasi) takes issue with this statement. He writes:
This is difficult to understand. Since [upon waking] one's hands are not clean, how is it possible that [the Rambam] says that one should recite these blessings [while still in bed]. The Talmud mentions this [practice. However, this is because the Sages] were particularly holy. They would wash their hands [at night before sleep] and would be able to maintain a state [of purity] such that they could recite the blessings in the morning in cleanliness. We, however, are unable to maintain this state of cleanliness. Therefore, it is proper that we recite them only after נטילת ידים (the washing of the hands).
This position is widely accepted and is the basis of our practice today. See the commentary to Halachah 9.
</i>, he says:
My Lord, t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:1, the Rambam writes:
All of the blessings begin with <i>Baruch</i> and conclude with <i>Baruch</i> except the final blessing of the blessings associated with the <i>Shema</i>, a blessing which follows directly after another blessing, and a blessing over fruit, those [blessings] which resemble it, or a blessing for mitzvot.
Given this statement, the commentaries wonder why this blessing does not begin with <i>Baruch</i>. Furthermore, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:5, the Rambam writes that, unless a blessing follows another blessing, it must mention God's sovereignty over the world and no such mention is made in this blessing.
The <i>Meiri</i> in his commentary to <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) offers the following resolution to these difficulties: Despite the fact that the entire period of a person's sleep divides between the recitation of <i>hamapil</i> and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i>, the sleep is not considered as an interruption and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is considered as following directly after <i>hamapil</i>. Accordingly, it is not required to begin with <i>Baruch</i> or mention God's sovereignty.
Other commentaries who follow different halachic perspectives than the Rambam offer these resolutions:<br>
1) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is a blessing of praise and prayer and does not require an opening phrase of blessing, in the same way that the blessing recited before travelling does not (<i>Tosafot, Pesachim</i> 104b).<br>
2) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is generally recited immediately after the blessing of אשר יצר and therefore can be considered as a blessing which follows another blessing.

</i> Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who gives the rooster understanding to distinguish between day and night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the crowing of the rooster generally heralds the dawn, the Sages established this blessing in response to it.
The word שכוי is translated as ""rooster"" based on <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26a which refers to Job 38:36: ""Who has put wisdom in the inward parts and [given] understanding to the rooster (שכוי).""
Rabbenu Asher (in his halachic commentary to <i>Berachot</i>) interprets שכוי as ""heart."" The heart is the source of understanding which allows man to distinguish between day and night.

In contrast, Rabbenu Yitzchok Alfasi interprets the Talmud's statement as referring to donning the <i>tallit</i>.
<i>Tosafot</i> and other Ashkenazic authorities maintain that this blessing should be reciting upon putting on a hat, yarmulke, or other headcovering.
</i>, he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who crowns Israel in glory<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) associates this blessing with the prohibition of walking four cubits with one's head uncovered (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b; See <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 5:6). Covering our heads symbolizes Israel's fear and awe before God's presence. This is their glory, as Isaiah 62:3 states: ""You shall be a crown of glory in the hand of God.""
</i>.<br>When he passes his hands over his eyes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In order to cause sleep to pass from their eyes, people often rub them vigorously.
Our text of <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states when ""one opens his eyes."" Many authorities favor this version over the text quoted by the Rambam (and Rav Yitzchok Alfasi) because <i>Shabbat</i> 108b warns of the dire consequences of touching one's eyes before washing one's hands in the morning. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46:2) suggests that people might have avoided the problem by cleaning their eyes with a cloth or rubbing their eyes with closed eyelids (<i>Sha'arei Teshuvah</i>).
</i>, he recites: [Blessed...] who opens the eyes of the blind<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing is based on Psalms 146:18 and can be interpreted as a statement of gratitude for more than our physical eyesight. We thank God for the ability to see His greatness in creation. These are our metaphorical ""eyes of reason.""
</i>.<br>When he sits up in his bed, he recites: [Blessed...] who unties those bound<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> thanking God for the ability to move our limbs after sleep.
</i>.<br>When he lowers his feet from the bed and rests them on the ground, he recites: [Blessed...] who spreads the earth over the waters<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing is based on Psalms 136:6: ""[Give thanks] to the One who spread the earth over the waters, for His lovingkindness is eternal.""
</i>.<br>When he stands up, he recites: [Blessed...] who straightens the bowed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is based on Psalms 146:8. This blessing expresses gratitude for the uniquely human characteristic of upright posture. It may also be interpreted as giving thanks to God, the source of salvation for those bowed and downtrodden.
The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) states that if one recites this blessing before the blessing ""who unties those bound,"" he should refrain from reciting the latter blessing. Though there is some difference of opinion about the matter, most later authorities accept the <i>Tur's</i> decision.
</i>.<br>When he washes his hands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:2, the Rambam specifically states that one should recite this blessing before washing one's hands so that the blessing will precede the performance of the mitzvah (<i>Pesachim</i> 7a). Rabbenu Yonah states that one should not recite this blessing until after washing one's hands because until one has washed his hands, he is not in a fit state to mention God's name (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 4:2). (According to others, the recitation of this blessing should be delayed until after drying one's hands.)
The Rambam obviously does not accept this rationale since he requires many blessings to be recited before the washing of the hands as above.
</i>, he recites: [Blessed...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although this washing was instituted by the Rabbis, this wording is appropriate, as is explained in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).
</i> regarding the washing of hands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This washing is required in preparation for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> and the morning service.
Based on the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. I, 169b, 184b), the Rabbis rule that, on washing in the morning, one pours water over his hands three times alternately, i.e., once over the right hand, once over the left hand, once more over the right, etc. This is done in order to remove the spirit of impurity that remains after sleep.
</i>.<br>When he washes his face<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note Chapter 4, Halachah 2, which states that a person must wash his face in the morning as a preparation for prayer.

May it be Your will, God, my Lord and Lord of my fathers, that You accustom me to the performance of [Your] commandments and do not accustom me to sins or transgressions. Cause the positive inclination to rule over me and not the evil inclination. Strengthen me in Your commandments and grant my portion in Your Torah. Allow me to find favor, lovingkindness, and mercy in Your eyes and the eyes of all who see me and bestow upon me benevolent kindnesses. Blessed are You, God, who bestows benevolent kindnesses.","Blessed are You, God, Our Lord, King of the universe, who removes the bonds of sleep from my eyes"," The last traces of drowsiness disappear when one washes his face (<i>Avudraham</i>).

Therefore, one should not recite ""Amen"" after hearing a colleague recite the opening sentence of the blessing (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 46:1). <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) states that one should say ""and may it be..."" to emphasize that the prayer is a single blessing.
<b>my Lord and Lord of my fathers, that You accustom me -</b> The Rambam, and similarly the <i>Tur</i>, use the first person singular, thus, making the prayer an individual statement. However, most siddurim use the first person plural, ""us.""
<b>to the performance of [Your] commandments and do not accustom me to sins or transgressions. Cause the positive inclination to rule over me and not the evil inclination. -</b> Though we always have free will, we ask God to strengthen our potential for making the proper choice (<i>Taz</i>).

Allow me to find favor, lovingkindness, and mercy in Your eyes and the eyes of all who see me and bestow upon me benevolent kindnesses.

You have made him [man] a little lower than angels.... You have given him dominion over the works of Your hands. You have put everything under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the sky and the fish of the seas.

He also allows a woman to wash her hands in order to feed her child.
The source for the Rambam's statements, <i>Yoma</i> 77b, explains that the reason for this leniency is the presence of <i>shivta</i> on her hands. Rashi interprets this as רוח רעה, the spirit of impurity which rests on our hands before the morning washing.
<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Yoma</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) rules that one does wash his hands upon rising in the morning on Yom Kippur since רוח רעה is considered like any filth and may be removed in its normal fashion. As apparent from the previous halachot, the Rambam does not consider רוח רעה as a significant factor and forbids such washing. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh, Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i>.)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 613:2) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion and states:
One washes his hands in the morning [on Yom Kippur] and recites על נטילת ידים. One should be careful to wash only the ends of the joints of his fingers.
The Ramah adds: ""And he should not intend to enjoy the washing, and do so [only] to remove the רוח רעה from his hands.""
</i>or the blessing ""who removes the bonds of sleep....""<br>One who does not relieve himself does not recite the blessing, ""who created man in wisdom...."" The same applies regarding the remainder of the blessings.","nor the blessing ""who removes the bonds of sleep"," which is associated with washing one's face. Since washing in this manner is prohibited on these days, one does not recite this blessing.
This ruling is also questioned by other halachic authorities. The Ra'avad states that since it is permissible to clean one's face if it is dirty, one may clean the dirt that collects in one's eyes overnight and recite the blessing associated with this washing.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 613:4 rules that one who is particularly fastidious may wash his face with water on the morning of Yom Kippur. The Ramah adds that the custom is to be very strict in this regard and not even to wash the eyes. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (basing himself on the <i>Bayit Chadash</i>) permits one to moisten his fingertips and clean the dirt from his eyes. All of these laws regarding Yom Kippur also apply to the ninth of Av.
One who does not relieve himself - in the morning.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 7,"One who rises to study Torah, whether the Written or Oral Law<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is debate in the Talmud about this matter. Some Sages did not require the recitation of a blessing for the study of certain portions of the Oral Law (See <i>Berachot</i> 11b). Nevertheless, the decision quoted by the Rambam is accepted by all halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:2 explains the reason for this decision, ""They [all portions of the Oral Law] are all Torah and were given to Moses at Mount Sinai.""
</i>, before he recites the <i>Shema</i>, s<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 11b states:
Once one has recited the <i>Shema</i>, he need not recite a blessing [for Torah study] since he has fulfilled his obligation with <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> (the second blessing before the <i>Shema</i>).
This blessing praises God for teaching our ancestors ""the laws that bring eternal life"" and includes our prayers that He ""grant our hearts understanding... to learn and to teach... all the teachings of Your Torah."" Therefore, <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> is considered as comparableáto the blessings recited before Torah study (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).
Rabbenu Asher quotes an opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) which states that the blessing of <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> can replace the blessings before the study of the Torah only when one studies immediately after reciting the <i>Shema</i> and <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. The Ra'avad and the Rashba, however, maintain that the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> is also considered as Torah study. Therefore, if one recites the <i>Shema</i> after <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i>, one is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.
The Rambam appears to follow the latter opinion, however, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:8) accepts Rabbenu Asher's view.

</i>hould wash his hands beforehand, recite [the following] three blessings, and then study<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Both here and in Halachah 11, the Rambam states that one must study immediately after reciting these blessings. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) explains the motivating principle: All blessings recited before the performance of a commandment must be followed immediately by the fulfillment of the commandment.
This position is, however, not universally accepted. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b), Rabbenu Yonah, and the Mordechai disagree and do not require the repetition of the blessings even if an interruption was made between their recitation and Torah study. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>,:9) warns against making such an interruption.
[The comparison of the blessings before Torah study to the blessings of the mitzvot is not universally accepted. In addition to the opinion of the Ramban mentioned in the following halachah, the <i>Levush</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) compares the blessings before Torah study to the blessings recited before partaking of food. Just as one thanks God for the satisfaction granted from food and other physical things, one blesses Him for the satisfaction derived from Torah study. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:1, <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> Vol. 14.]
</i>.<br>[These blessings] are:
[Blessed... universe,] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the words of Torah.<br>
A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are two different versions of this blessing:<br>
a) one which has its source in the published text of the Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 11b, and concludes: לעסוק בדברי תורה - ""to occupy [ourselves] in the words of Torah.""<br>
b) the version quoted by the Rambam: על דברי תורה - ""concerning the words of Torah."" This version is also found in the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon and the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchok Alfasi.
The siddurim of the Sephardim, Yemenites and Nusach Ari follow the Rambam's text, whereas Nusach Ashkenaz reads לעסוק בדברי תורה.<br>
[
In both versions, this blessing contains thirteen words corresponding to the thirteen principles of Biblical exegesis that apply to the Torah (יºג מדות שהתורה נדרשת בהן, <i>Shulchan Tahor</i>).]
</i>nd please, God, our Lord, make pleasant the words of Your Torah in our mouths and in the mouths of Your people, the entire House of Israel. May we, our offspring, and the offspring of Your people, be knowers of Your name and among those who occupy themselves with Your Torah. Blessed are You, God, who teaches Torah to His people, Israel.<br>
Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has chosen us from among all the nations and given us His Torah. Blessed are You, God, who gives the Torah.",And," The presence here of the Hebrew letter <i>vav</i> (ו) which is generally translated as ""and"" is the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis.
<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) explains that, according to <i>Rabbenu Tam</i>, any blessing that follows another blessing of only a single line must itself begin ""Blessed are You..."" and cannot be included in the phrase ""Blessed are You..."" in the first blessing. Therefore, since this paragraph does not begin ""Blessed are You...,"" it appears to be a continuation of the first blessing and not a blessing of its own. The <i>vav</i> - ""and"" - indicates the connection between the two paragraphs.
The Rambam, however, clearly states that the second paragraph is considered as a blessing in its own right and not a continuation of the first blessing. The <i>vav</i> would, therefore, appear to be superfluous. Though most printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include a <i>vav</i>, the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Yemenite manuscripts, and the Ramah's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> all lack a <i>vav</i>. (Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:5, which explains that even according to the opinion that the second paragraph is a separate blessing, adding the <i>vav</i> is in place.)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 47:6 rules that the <i>vav</i> should be recited. The Ramah adds that although the custom is not to say it, it should be said. Most siddurim of <i>Nusach Ashkenaz</i> and <i>Sefard</i> include the <i>vav</i>.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.11,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 7,"One is obligated to recite these three blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The nature of this obligation is debated among the commentaries. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) and others understand the Rambam as considering these blessings similar to any other blessing recited before the performance of a mitzvah and hence, of Rabbinic origin.
Nevertheless, <i>Berachot</i> 21a and <i>Yoma</i> 37a state that the obligation to recite a blessing on Torah study stems from the Torah itself. In keeping with this view, the Ramban (<i>Hosafot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, positive commandment 15) reckons the recitation of the blessings of the Torah as a separate mitzvah.
</i> every day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Perhaps with the words ""every day,"" the Rambam is implying that these blessings should be recited even if one does not sleep at night. See <i>Magen Avraham</i> 47:11.
The blessings are recited only once a day. In contrast to the blessings recited over other mitzvot, even if one interrupts his study and occupies himself with other matters, one need not recite a second blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 4:7 gives two reasons for this difference:<br>
1) The blessings before the Torah resemble the other morning blessings. A person enjoys the benefits associated with the morning blessings intermittently throughout the day, yet he only recites the blessings once in the morning. Similarly, though one may study at several different occasions in a single day, the blessings are recited only once daily.<br>
2) The obligation to study Torah is incumbent upon one throughout the entire day and, at all times, one's attention should be on one's studies.
</i>. Afterwards, one should read a few words of Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If these blessings are comparable to other blessings recited before the performance of mitzvot, the mitzvah (studying Torah) must also be fulfilled immediately after the recitation of the blessing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i>. [To fulfill this obligation,] the people adopted the custom of reading the Priestly Blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Priestly Blessing is found in Numbers 6:22-27. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b) also mentions the custom of reciting the Priestly Blessing each morning and Rav Amram Gaon includes the Priestly Blessing in his siddur.
The <i>Avudraham</i> mentions that the recitation of these verses arouses Divine blessing for the Jewish people. The <i>Even Yarchi</i> notes that the verses of the Priestly Blessing contain 60 letters, corresponding to the 60 tractates in the Talmud.
</i>. In certain places, they recite [the passage, (Numbers 28: 1-9)]: ""Command the children of Israel...,"" a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These verses describe the morning sacrifice offered daily in the Holy Temple. The <i>Machzor Vitri</i> (an early siddur of French origin) does not include the Priestly Blessing and mentions these verses instead.

The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:9) both understand the Priestly Blessing to be a fulfillment of the requirement to study Torah after the blessings. The verses of the Daily Sacrifice are recited later, with the intention that our recitation of these verses will compensate for our inability to actually offer these sacrifices (<i>Ta'anit</i> 27b, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 48).

(Note the statement of Rabbi Simlai, <i>Berachot</i> 32a, which suggests praising God before reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.)

They instituted a blessing before the [recitation of the] songs, Baruch She'amar..., - Tradition states that the <i>Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah</i> received this blessing and the blessing,<i>Yishtabach</i>, from Heaven. Therefore, our custom is to recite these blessings standing (<i>Or Zerua</i>).
The <i>Pri Chadash</i> takes issue with this view and maintains that these blessings were instituted by the <i>Geonim</i> after the conclusion of the Talmud. Though the <i>Or Zerua's</i> opinion is based only on ""tradition,"" the fact that the Jerusalem Talmud refers to these blessings, as mentioned below, indicates that they were recited during the Talmudic era.

Accordingly, it does not begin ""Blessed are You, God....""
Though the verses of פסוקי דזמרא are not considered an interruption between the blessings, idle conversation certainly would be.

Rabbi Meir used to say: ""One is obligated to recite 100 blessings every day as [implied by Deuteronomy 10:12]: 'And now Israel, what is it that God, your Lord, asks of you.'”
Rashi explains that the word, מה- ""what"" can be read as מאה - ""100"", allowing for the interpretation, ""And now Israel, 100 [blessings] is what God, your Lord, asks of you.""
The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) quotes Rav Natrunai Gaon who attributes the institution of this custom to King David.

The <i>Kedushah</i> recited when repeating the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is considered as a ""holy matter"" of this nature. (See <i>Berachot</i> 21b, <i>Megillah</i> 23b. See also Chapter 8, Halachah 4, and Chapter 9, Halachah 5 for a discussion of the text of <i>Kedushah</i>.)
In this halachah, the Rambam equates all three recitations of the <i>Kedushah</i> in the morning service. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 59) cites Rav Natrunai Gaon as also sharing this opinion. There is no specific Talmudic or Midrashic source to this effect. However, the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, 129b, 132b) also considers all three recitations of <i>Kedushah</i> to be bound by the same rulings.
Rabbenu Yonah quotes the opinion of the Ashkenazic authorities who distinguish between these recitations of <i>Kedushah</i>. They maintain that since, in the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, we liken ourselves to the angels and recite the same praises, a <i>minyan</i> is necessary. However, the other <i>Kedushot</i> are simply narrative descriptions of the praises uttered by the angels and therefore, do not require a <i>minyan</i>.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 59:3) quotes the Rambam's position. The Ramah concludes that even an individual should recite the blessing without deleting the <i>Kedushah</i>.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> writes that Rabbi Avraham, the Rambam's son, states that his father later changed his position regarding this halachah and wrote in a responsum that one should recite <i>Kedushah</i> even without a quorum of ten. This is also recorded by <i>Orchot Chayim</i>, Rashba, and Rabbenu Manoach. However, there are other responsa which indicate that the Rambam did not change his mind.

The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1) equates one who does not fulfill this practice to a loved one who knocks on the door of the king and then departs. When the king answers the door and sees no one there, he also turns away.

<b>adds supplications according to his ability -</b> In Chapter 9:5, the Rambam rules that one should recite the passage, <i>U'va l'Tzion go'el</i>.

Therefore, an individual recites only the supplications found at the end of that prayer.
In his Order of Prayers, the Rambam also mentions the custom of reciting the ""song of the day"" and of <i>eyn k'e-loheinu</i>.
<b>and departs to his own affairs. -</b> The <i>Tur</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 155:1) quote <i>Berachot</i> 64a which states that after prayer, one should proceed to Torah study. It is unclear why the Rambam does not mention this point.

However, it appears that this emendation was made by Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, and not the Rambam himself.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:1) permits the use of fruit juice. However, the Ramah (462:4) states that it is Ashkenazic custom not to use fruit juice for matzah on Pesach out of the fear that some water might perhaps be mixed together with it (see below). Nevertheless, he does allow leniency for people who are ill or sick and have difficulty eating normal matzah.
Among the present day applications of this concept is commercially produced ""egg matzah."" According to the above guidelines, in the Ashkenazic community, such matzah:

a) cannot be used in the Seder, as explained in the commentary to Halachah 6:2;
b) must contain only eggs and fruit juice, with no water whatsoever;
c) even so, should be eaten only by those with medical problems that prevent them from eating normal matzah.

The above is the source for the practice of eating <i>shemurah matzah</i>, matzah made from grain which has been watched to ensure that it did not become chametz and prepared with the intent that it be used for the mitzvah of eating matzah. The use of such matzah during the Seder is an absolute requirement (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 460), and it is advisable to use it throughout the holiday.
</i>. Therefore, our Sages declared: A person must be careful regarding the grain which he eats on Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 40a relates that Ravvah would tell the harvesters cutting wheat for Pesach: ""Have the intent that this grain be used for the mitzvah of matzah.""
</i> and [make sure] that no water has come in contact with it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The chronicles of Jewish community life in both Eastern Europe and North Africa relate how the harvest of the wheat used for matzah was always begun at noontime, long after the morning dew had risen.
</i> after it has been harvested<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Based on the above passage from <i>Pesachim</i>, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi and the Rambam require that the grain be watched from the time of harvesting onward. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Asher follows a more lenient policy and does not require the wheat to be watched until it is ground. [Rabbenu Nissim explains that even Rav Yitzchak Alfasi only recommended watching the matzah from harvesting as a pious measure, and not as an absolute rule.]
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 453:4) explains that it is preferable to use grain that has been watched from harvesting; as a minimum requirement, one must use grain that has been watched from the time it has been ground into flour. If there is no other alternative, one may buy flour in the marketplace and begin watching from the time the dough is kneaded.
The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> clarifies the latter point explaining that where grain is washed or submerged in water before grinding it into flour, such grain may not be used for matzah. (This practice is still common in many communities.) In practice, most <i>shemurah matzah</i> made at present is watched from the time the grain was harvested.

Since the wheat was constantly being agitated, it would not become leavened. In contrast, this halachah contains a more stringent ruling, for the grain was left at rest (<i>Tzafnat Paneach</i>).

Apparently, the Rambam's text of the Talmud did not contain that phrase. If a Jew knows that the grain has become leavened, he will surely take the necessary precautions so that it will not remain in his possession on Pesach.

That halachah specifically states that a sick person may be given chametz to eat as a remedy.
Furthermore, that halachah explains that if the sick person does not benefit from the forbidden substance in the normal manner, it may be used as a remedy even if there is no danger to life or limb. The Rambam gives the example of including chametz in a compress.
On that basis, Rabbenu Manoach questions why wheat cannot be used as a poultice as stated in our halachah. However, he resolves the issue by explaining that, in our case, the wheat would become chametz before it was applied to the wound.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 466:5 (and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>) emphasize that it is permitted to use grain as a remedy for a wound only if there is a question of danger to life or limb. Furthermore, this leniency is qualified as follows:
a) it must be an established medical fact that the remedy works;
b) effort must be made to reduce the chance of the grain becoming leavened to the greatest extent possible (e.g., preparing grain by boiling it in fruit juice which does not become leavened).

The Rambam's statements are accepted by Rabbenu Asher, Rabbenu Nissim, and most other authorities. Nevertheless, it is significant that Rav Hai Gaon, one of the major authorities who preceded the Rambam, offers a different explanation for Rabbi Abahu's actions.
Rav Hai Gaon maintains that it is impossible that a doubt existed among the Jewish people concerning such an important manner as sounding the shofar. Since the shofar was sounded each year, surely the tradition could have been maintained. Hence, he explains that all the different manners of sounding the shofar were acceptable and that Rabbi Abahu's contribution was the establishment of a uniform custom that included all the different practices common among the Jewish people. By mentioning the ""many years"" and ""exiles,"" the Rambam addresses himself to the question raised by Rav Hai Gaon.

Most other authorities (see <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 590:12) explain that this applies only if one sounds the shofar with an improper blast, intending to fulfill one's obligation. Otherwise, no significance at all is attached to the shofar blast and it is not considered an interruption.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.6","Shofar, Sukkah, vLulav - Chapter 3","If a person heard nine shofar blasts from nine men simultaneously<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At the same time, six blew <i>teki'ot</i> and three, <i>teru'ot</i>, so that the person could have heard the required number of shofar blasts
</i>, he has not fulfilled his obligation for a single blast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach gives two reasons for this decision:
a) because of the cacophony of sounds, the listener is unable to properly distinguish any one;
b) As stated in the previous halachah, one must hear the shofar blasts in the proper order, a <i>teki'ah</i> preceding and following a <i>teru'ah</i>; that requirement is not fulfilled in this instance.
Rashi, in his commentary on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34b, disagrees with the Rambam's decision, explaining that <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a states that even though two people blow the shofar simultaneously, since the mitzvah is dear to the hearer, he will concentrate sufficiently to differentiate between the sounds. Furthermore, the <i>Tosefta</i> 2:12 states specifically that one does fulfill one's obligation in this manner.
<i>Tosafot</i> disagrees with Rashi, mentioning the second reason stated by Rabbenu Manoach. It appears that the Rambam goes further and discounts Rashi's opinion entirely. According to <i>Tosafot</i>, the listener will have heard at least the first <i>teki'ah</i>, while the Rambam explicitly states ""he has not fulfilled his obligation for a single blast."" (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 588:3 quotes the Rambam's decision as halachah. The Ramah quotes the law from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a, allowing a person to fulfill his obligation even though he heard two people blowing the shofar at the same time, provided he heard the blasts in the proper order.
</i>. [If he heard] a <i>teki'ah</i> from one, a <i>teru'ah</i> from another, and another <i>teki'ah</i> from a third, in sequence, he has fulfilled his obligation.<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The fact that different people sounded the shofar does not prevent the fulfillment of the mitzvah.
</i>he above applies even if one heard [the shofar blasts] with interruptions, even if [the blowing was extended] over the entire day. A person does not fulfill his obligation until he hears all nine shofar blasts, for they are all [only] one mitzvah. Thus, they are dependent one on the other.","The above applies even if one heard [the shofar blasts] with interruptions, even if [the blowing was extended] over the entire day"," There is a certain redundancy with this statement, because the same principle was mentioned in the previous halachah. Nonetheless, the Rambam included it to emphasize that the passage of time is not considered an interruption even when the shofar is being blown by different people (Rabbenu Manoach).

There are specific prohibitions against drinking - e.g. a priest is not allowed to perform the priestly services while under the influence of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9-11). Similarly, numerous passages throughout the Prophets and Sacred Writings castigate drunkenness. These are also paralleled in the rabbinic literature, e.g. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70a, <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 12.

Woe to those judges who act with such affront to the Torah of Moses, who disgrace its laws and reduce it to the earth, bring it down to the dust and cause evil to themselves and their descendants in this world and the next.
Most commentaries cite <i>Pesachim</i> 49a as the source for the Rambam's statement, however, that passage does not mention intoxication. The <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. I, 110a, specifically associates drunkenness with the desecration of God's name.

<i>Nedarim</i> 20b emphasizes that the midnight hour also allows a person to rest from all his worldly involvement. The quiet of the hour prevents him from being disturbed by other thoughts and he is able to concentrate on his wife alone.
Despite the advantages of having relations at midnight, many contemporary authorities suggest that a couple not hold to this as a binding rule. If a couple have already begun thinking of sex, they should not be forced to wait until midnight to fulfill their desires.
He should not be excessively lightheaded, - Previously (Chapter 2, Halachah 7), the Rambam cited a mishnah (<i>Avot</i> 3:16) which links lightheadedness and immorality.

Human Dispositions 5.6,De'ot - Chapter 5,"Torah Sages conduct themselves with exceptional modesty<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With this statement, the Rambam establishes a connection with the previous halachah and sets the motif for what follows. Modesty is not simply a matter of dress, (this is discussed in halachah 9), but rather, an awareness of God which causes a person to cover head and body out of respect for the Divine Presence. The Rambam expands upon this concept in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Vol. III, Chapter 52):
He is constantly with us, observing us, as [Jeremiah 23:24] proclaims: 'Can a man hide himself in the secret places and I not see him,' says God."" Understand this well.<br>
Know that when perfect men comprehend this, they achieve such humility, such awe and fear of God and a sense of shame before Him... that their private behavior with their wives and in latrines is like their public conduct with other people.<br>
Know that they have forbidden a man to walk with an erect carriage, because: ""the entire world is filled with His glory"" (Isaiah 6:3 ... We are always in His presence... Thus, the greatest among the Sages found it difficult to bare their heads because the Divine Presence constantly hovers over man.
</i>. They do not demean themselves and do not bare their heads<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> 30a relates that Rabbi Chiya bar Abba once saw Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi taking his son to school while wearing a makeshift hat. When Rabbi Chiya asked him the reason he was wearing such a head-covering, he explained that he was forced to leave his home in a hurry and was not able to arrange his turban. Nevertheless, he found it preferable to wear even a makeshift head-covering, rather than go out bareheaded.
<i>Kiddushin</i> 31a quotes Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yeshoshua, as explaining that he would not walk four cubits bareheaded out of respect for ""the Divine Presence which is above my head."" (See also <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. III, p. 245b.) Similarly, <i>Shabbat</i> 156b relates that an astrologer told Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak's mother that he was destined to be a thief. From his earliest childhood, she trained him to avoid this fate. She would constantly tell him to cover his head ""so that the fear of God will be upon you.""
</i> or their bodies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (2:1) lays down the following general rule: Any portion of our bodies which is usually covered should not be revealed unless there is a specific reason for doing so.
Modesty, as understood in the present context, results from the awareness of the Divine Presence. The ordinary man experiences such awareness while at prayer when ""he is as if standing before the Divine Presence"" (<i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:16) and then he is required not to bare his head (ibid. 5:5) or various parts of his body; e.g., his chest (ibid. 4:7) and his feet (ibid. 5:5). As emphasized in Chapter 3, Halachah 3, a wise man should try to be conscious of the Divine Presence at all times and places. As a result, he will constantly be modest.
Though in Talmudic times and in the Rambam's era, personal modesty and covering one's head were considered the signs of a Sage (<i>Kiddushin</i> 8a) and a unique and special merit (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b), at present, both practices have been accepted as ordinary behavior for all observant Jews.
Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. - <i>Tamid</i> 27b quotes Rav as giving his son the following advice: ""Sit and reveal yourself. Cover yourself and stand.""
</i>.<br>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. He should not wipe himself clean with the right hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the right hand is used to tie <i>Tefillin</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 62a) and is given priority over the left hand regarding service in the Temple (<i>Zevachim</i> 24a), the installation ceremony of priests (Leviticus 8:23 , and other ritual manners, it is not proper that it be used for this function.
Many authorities maintain that this restriction only applies when one is cleaning oneself with one's hand alone, but not when one uses toilet paper.
</i>. He should stay away from all others and enter a chamber beyond a chamber, a cave within a cave, and relieve himself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 62b derives this law from I Samuel 24:3's description of the behavior of King Saul. Though it is forbidden to delay relieving oneself (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:31), our Sages did not give this prohibition precedence over the dictates of modesty (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 3:11).
</i>. If<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> no latrine is available and
</i> he [must] relieve himself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These restrictions only apply to defecation. The Sages feared that refraining from urination might be damaging (<i>Bechorot</i> 44b).
</i> behind a fence, he should move far enough away that no one can hear the sound if he breaks wind<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., even though an observer might see that he is squatting and thus, conclude that he is defecating, since the fence covers his lower body, there is no difficulty (<i>Berachot</i> 62a).

The Rambam clarifies the definition of what constitutes a primary category and what constitutes a derivative in Halachot 2-6.
See <i>Yereim</i> (249) who notes that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) derives the existence of thirty nine categories of work from the exegesis of Exodus 38:2. There is a question if this difference in sources creates a difference in law as well. See also the preface to <i>Eglei Tal,</i> which questions whether the definition of the categories of forbidden labor are taken from the activities necessary for the offering of the sacrifices in the Sanctuary, or merely the activities necessary for construction of the Sanctuary. (In this context, see Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 73a, which states that the forbidden labor of baking was not practiced in the Sanctuary although one of the offerings was the showbread which was baked each week.)

Some draw attention to the parallel found in the Mishnah's description of the number of lashes given a transgressor (<i>Makkot</i> 3:10).

Rashi explains that Rabbi Elazar was so immersed in his Torah study that he thought about it even against his will. Rabbenu Manoach quotes the Ra'avad as saying that in such a case, thoughts of Torah are permitted when at the latrine. <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>.) advises that people should force themselves to think of mundane matters in order to avoid thoughts of Torah in unclean places.

The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and states that since this attribute is used as a name only in relation to God, it may not be uttered in the latrine. Rabbenu Yonah quotes Psalms 112:4 as a source that uses the term רחום in relation to a righteous person, thereby refuting the Ra'avad.

One prohibits the <i>Shema</i> to be read near the excrement of dogs and pigs, and the other prohibits <i>Kri'at</i> Shema in the presence of these excrements only when skins are soaking in them. Ravvah prefers the second source, and the Rambam decides halachah in accordance with Ravvah's position.
Rashi explains that the idea of soaking skins applies only to the excrement of dogs and pigs, since it is a common practice to soak skins in them, but not to human feces, which is not used for such a purpose.

The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and quotes the Jerusalem Talmud, which includes donkey urine as one of those items that prohibit <i>Kri'at</i> Shema. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Talmud on which the Rambam based his decision most probably mentioned donkey dung (as mentioned in the previous comment) and not donkey urine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:6 reflects the position of the Ra'avad.
Rabbenu Asher points out that the Rambam mentions animal urine alone as not being problematic, thereby indicating that animal dung (e.g., cow or horse excrement) would be problematic. Rabbenu Asher himself sees no room to prohibit animal dung, since it is never mentioned in the Talmud as problematic. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> holds that the Rambam's position is that animal dung is prohibited only if its smell causes discomfort, and that the extent of this discomfort is somewhat subjective. Therefore, the Rambam did not mention it explicitly.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:4 rules in accordance with this understanding of the Rambam. (This is not surprising, since the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> were both written by Rav Yosef Karo.)

Rather, it is dependent on the measure established by the Sages, and this is the subject of debate by the Rabbinic authorities. The <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) explains that the Rambam considers an olive as one third the size of an egg (כביצה, a more familiar Talmudic measure). In terms of modern measurements, this olive size would be between 16.6 and 24 grams, according to various Halachic opinions.
<i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Chullin</i> 103a) differs, and defines a 18תיזכ (the size of an olive) as one half the size of an egg (between 25.6 and 36 grams according to the various opinions).

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that there is no Talmudic source for this distinction. Therefore, he explains that there is no difference between stationary and moving feces and that this halachah only applies to feces which are behind one. If the feces are in front of one, the <i>Shema</i> cannot be recited until they move out of sight.

With regard to what? With regard to gazing at it. Behold, Rav Sheshet says that anyone who stares even at the little finger of a woman is like one staring at her most private parts. Rather, it refers to his wife and to <i>Kri'at</i> Shema.
Rashi interprets this to mean that a man may not recite the <i>Shema</i> next to his wife if a handbreadth of her body is uncovered. Rabbenu Asher explains that this refers to any part of his wife's body that is usually covered and clothed.
<i>Berachot</i> also mentions a woman's hair and her voice as <i>ervah</i>.
The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> interprets this passage to mean that since these restrictions were established with respect to one's wife, any part of the body of a woman other than his wife would be problematic. Thus, the <i>Shema</i> should not be recited in her presence.

<i>Berachot</i> 25b reports a disagreement as to whether a heel may ""see"" or touch ערוה, and rules that though the heel may see ערוה, it cannot touch it. The rationale for this distinction is that the Torah was not given to angels. Rashi explains that this implies that we cannot be expected to maintain such a formidable level of care, because we were created with physical nakedness against our wills.
Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Yonah suggest that no part of the body may touch one's genitalia during <i>Kri'at</i> Shema, and that the heel is given only as an example. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 74:5 accepts this position.

The Rambam and the vast majority of <i>Rishonim</i> follow the second position, because the first opinion does not take into account the rule “One's heart shall not see his nakedness.” If one is sleeping with no clothes on, he may separate the top half of his body from the lower half.

However, as obvious from the discussion in that chapter, the precise text of the Haggadah was a matter of debate and question throughout the Talmudic period. A few centuries after the completion of the Talmud, Rav Amram Gaon composed a text of the Haggadah that was accepted internationally, throughout all Jewish communities. Approximately sixty years later, his successor, Rav Saadia Gaon, composed a Haggadah with some changes and emendations. These two texts served as the basis for the Rambam's Haggadah and for the subsequent texts published by other Sages. Only minor differences exist between the Haggadah we use today and that composed by Rav Amram Gaon.

</i>",Blessed be the Omnipresent," The use of the word מקום as a name for God is based on <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 68:9: ""He is the place of the world and the world is not His place.""
<b>who has given the Torah to Israel; blessed be He --</b> Our text of the Haggadah employs a slightly different version, mentioning four expressions of blessing to parallel the four sons.
<b>The Torah speaks of four sons --</b> This passage is found with certain emendations in the Jerusalem Talmud and in the Mechiltah.
<b>that God, our Lord, has commanded you --</b> Both the aforementioned sources state ""has commanded us,"" preventing comparison between the wise and wicked sons. Nevertheless, the Rambam (as well as Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon) found it more appropriate to quote the verse from the Torah verbatim.
<b>reply to him, [teaching him] the laws of Pesach... --</b> Our text of the Jerusalem Talmud includes this as the answer to the simple son. Other commentaries (See <i>P'nei David, Simchat HaRegel</i>) give this as the answer to the wicked son.
<b>dessert --</b> The literal meaning of the Greek word <i>afikoman</i>--see the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <b>Pesachim</b> 10:8.
<b>you should blunt his teeth and tell him...-</b> Exodus 12:27 states that the question asked by the wicked son should be answered differently: ""It is the Passover service to God..."" The <i>Zevach Pesach</i> explains that the Haggadah implies, in addition to the reply given in the Torah, that he be reprimanded strongly, ""blunt his teeth...""
<b>The simple son --</b> the Jerusalem Talmud uses the expression: ""the foolish son.""
<b>""You shall tell your son on that day."" --</b> This verse, both the answer to the son who does not know how to ask and the source for the mitzvah to relate the story of the Exodus, serves as a transition between the passage of the four sons and the narrative of our redemption. (See also Halachah 7:1.)
<b>""it is because of this."" --</b> The word זה (this) is always used to refer to a clearly visible entity, as <i>Menachot</i> 29a comments on Exodus 12:2. Similarly, in this context, ""this"" refers to a situation where symbols of the Exodus, the matzah and the maror, are visibly present before us.
<b>In the beginning, our ancestors were worshipers of other gods --</b> <i>Pesachim</i> 115a quotes this passage as reflecting the principle that the narrative of the Exodus must begin by relating our people's roots. (See Halachah 7:4.) It must be noted that the Rambam chooses slightly different phraseology from that employed in other Haggadot.
<b>Blessed be He Who keeps His promise to Israel --</b> This passage is found in the Haggadot of Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon. However, its origins are unknown.
<b>the Holy One, blessed be He, calculated the end of [our bondage] --</b> i.e. counting the 400 years of oppression from the birth of Isaac, for during that entire time, the Jews were ""strangers in a land that is not their own."" The Egyptian exile itself lasted only 210 years. See Rashi, Exodus 12:40.
<b>""An Aramean sought to destroy my father..."" --</b> This and the verses that follow are part of the וידוי ביכורים recited when the Jews would bring their first fruits to Jerusalem. <i>Pesachim</i> 116a requires the person reciting the Haggadah to ""expound from 'An Aramean sought to destroy my father' until he completes the entire passage."" This implies that the exegesis of the verses found in the Haggadah was already extant at that time.
The commentaries quote the <i>Sifri</i> as the source for these interpretations though our text of the <i>Sifri</i> contains only portions of this passage. [The passage is found in the <i>Mechiltah d'Rashbi</i> in its entirety. However, some authorities maintain that it was a later addition.] Nevertheless, other early collections of Midrashim, such as <i>Lekach Tov, Midrash HaGadol,</i> and the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, include the complete text.
<b>""I made you as numerous as the plants of the field..."" --</b> Though the verse has no explicit connection to the Exodus, the commentaries explain that it describes the situation of the Jews in Egypt in metaphoric terms.
Many texts of the Haggadah also include the previous verse from Ezekiel: ""And when I passed by you, I saw you weltering in your blood..."" Rav Ya'akov Emden relates that he and his father, the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i>, would recite this verse even though he did not find it in other texts. (His statement is slightly questionable. There are some earlier texts of the Haggadah, such as <i>Siddur HaAri zal</i>, which do include it.)
<b>""I will pass through... and I will slay... I will execute... I, God."" --</b> Our text of the Haggadah contains a further elaboration of this verse, showing how each use of the word ""I"" is intended to exclude God's use of an intermediary to execute judgement.
<b>Rabbi Yehudah coined abbreviations for them: detzach, adash, b'achav. --</b> This concludes the exegesis of the verses of the וידוי ביכורים in the <i>Sifri</i>.
Our Haggadot (and similarly, those of Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon) continue with a number of other passages:
a) Statements by Rabbi Yossi HaG'lili, Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabbi Akiva concerning the number of plagues with which the Egyptians were punished;
b) Passages recounting the extent of God's generosity to the Jewish people.
The first group of statements have their source in the <i>Mechiltah</i>. Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, relates that his father did not include them in his text of the Haggadah because they were not popularly known. Nevertheless, it was his custom to recite them at the Seder.
The source for the second grouping of passages is less clear. They are not explicitly found in any Midrash.
<b>Rabban Gamliel would say --</b> This passage and the remaining passages until the blessing, <i>asher ge'alanu</i>, are explicitly mentioned in the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a,b. (See also Halachot 7:5, 8:4 and the commentary, which mentions the change in the order there.)
<b>has not fulfilled his obligation --</b> to relate the story of the Exodus. See Halachah 7:5.
<b>In every generation --</b> This passage is found in <b>Pesachim</b> 116b. However, in contrast to the Talmud and our text of the Haggadah, the Rambam's text omits quoting Exodus 13:8: ""And you shall tell your son..."" Apparently, the Rambam had a different text of the Mishnah, which omitted this verse. This difference in texts is also the source for the Rambam's statements, Halachah 7:6: ""In every generation, a person is obligated to present himself..."" See the commentary on that halachah.
<b>He brought us out from there --</b> Ravvah, <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid., requires reciting this verse.
<b>Therefore, we are obliged to thank, praise, laud, glorify, exalt, magnify, adore, and give eternal praise --</b> With slight textual differences, this entire passage is found in <i>Pesachim</i> 116b. (See also Halachah 8:5).
<b>Halleluyah! Servants of God,... [one continues reciting the Psalms] until...</b> the flintstone into a stream of water — The Hallel was recited both while slaughtering the Paschal sacrifice and while eating it. To commemorate the latter recitation, we recite the Hallel at the Seder.
We divide the Hallel into two portions (see <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid. and Halachah 8:5):
the first, containing Psalms referring to the Exodus from Egypt, we recite before the meal;
the second, containing Psalms referring to the Messianic redemption (see <i>Pesachim</i> 118a), is recited after the meal.
<b>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who redeemed us and redeemed our ancestors... --</b> This blessing is quoted from <i>Pesachim</i> 116b. The first portion was also recited while the Temple was standing.
<b>So too, God, our Lord and Lord of our fathers, enable us to reach --</b>This portion of the blessing, composed by Rabbi Akiva, represents a prayer for our redemption and the rebuilding of the Temple. (See <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid., Halachah 8:5.)
<b>other festivals --</b> The word ""other"" can also imply ""of a different nature""--i.e., we pray for the Messianic redemption, when our festivals will be of an entirely different nature.
<b>we shall eat of the sacrifices --</b> the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering
<b>and of the Paschal offerings --</b> The <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was not sacrificed when Pesach began on Saturday night. Accordingly, it is our custom to reverse the order of these sacrifices on such an occasion. However, the Rambam does not mention such a practice.
<b>Then, we shall sing a new song for our redemption --</b> The <i>Mechiltah</i> (see also <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i>, ibid.) notes that the Bible mentions nine songs sang by the Jewish people as a collective entity. In each case, the Hebrew for song, שירה, is used in the feminine gender, for our redemption was not complete. In contrast, the song to be sung to greet Mashiach will be a
שיר חדש, a new song. The masculine gender is used because the Messianic redemption will represent the complete and ultimate liberation of our people. May it come speedily in our days.

In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:1, based on <i>Berachot</i> 47b), the Rambam states that this refers to a gentile who has already made a decision to convert and has been circumcised for that reason. Nevertheless, if he has not immersed himself in the mikveh, he is not considered a Jew, and may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>.<br>
14. This ruling is not accepted by many other authorities, including Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher. Because of the difference of opinion, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:3) rules that, at the outset, an attempt should be made to follow the Rambam's decision. If, however, the third person does not desire to eat bread, he may be included in the <i>zimmun</i> as long as he partook of a<i>k'zayit</i> of other foods.<br>
15. The commentaries note that the Rambam does not quote <i>Berachot</i> 48a (the source for this halachah) exactly. The Talmud states ""dipped his food in brine with them."" The Rambam's choice of phraseology is particularly difficult since, as the Rambam himself writes in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:5, brine is generally not eaten alone as a food.<br>
16. The commentaries have noted the apparent redundancy in the Rambam's expressions. The <i>Kol ben Levi</i> offers a possible resolution, explaining that, in the opening clause, the Rambam states that these people are not required to make a <i>zimmun</i>. In the final clause, he states that they are not allowed to do so.<br>
 17. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 47a, writes that if they have already decided to recite grace, the third person may not be included in a<i>zimmun</i> with them. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:1) accepts this ruling.<br>
18. According to the Rambam's opinion mentioned in the previous halachah, the third person must partake of bread. According to the other opinions mentioned above, if the third person partakes of other foods, the first two may include him in a <i>zimmun</i>.<br>
19. <i>Berachot</i> 47a relates that Rav Simai bar Chiyya joined Rav and Shemuel in a meal after the latter had completed eating. They ate another side dish together with him, and then recited the <i>zimmun</i>.<br>
20. Note the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 197, which states that they are obligated to recite the <i>zimmun</i>.<br>
21. He may, however, convey this privilege on another person if he desires (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 201:1).
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that if a guest is present, he should be given the privilege of reciting the<i>zimmun</i>, so that he will be able to recite a blessing for the host, as mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 7.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) also mentions that a priest who is a Torah sage should be given the privilege of reciting the <i>zimmun</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 4:2 and <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 12:18.)
22. Although a sufficient number of people to recite grace with a<i>zimmun</i> will remain, each individual is personally obligated to participate in the <i>zimmun</i> and may not recite grace alone.<br>
23. Enough people remain in each group to allow them both to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>. There is, however, no obligation to separate. If the people desire, they may recite grace in a single group (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1).<br>
24. Until there are twenty people, separation will prevent - at the very least - the people who separate from reciting grace with God's name.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1, based on<i>Berachot</i> 50a) states that, at a meal attended by many people, if there is a difficulty or inconvenience preventing an individual from participating in the <i>zimmun</i> in which God's name is mentioned, he may recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i> of three.

Some manuscript editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> use the word <i>min</i> (non-believer) instead of <i>apikoros</i>. In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:7, the Rambam describes the <i>min</i> as one who does not believe in God, whereas the heretic denies not God, but Torah.
Historically, this could refer to the Saducees and other Jews with assimilationist tendencies that began to multiply at this time. Though they were definitely a minority among the people, their number was signficant enough to warrant concern.

Shmuel Hakatan rose and composed it.<br>","
<i>Olat Re'iah</i> explains why this Sage was chosen: All of our great and wise Sages were able to compose the other blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> which are full of love and giving. The blessing of the heretics differs for it appears full of hate and destruction.
The composition of this blessing required great care, since the content must not imply the hatred of people per se, but a righteous indignation, born out of love for God and the pain felt when His Majesty is not honored. Shmuel HaKatan authored the famous statement: ""Refrain from joy at the fall of your enemies"" (<i>Pirkei Avot</i> 4:19). Thus, he was most worthy to author this blessing. His zealousness bore no trace whatsoever of hate, but was a true reflection of his unbounded love for God and His Torah.
Consequently, there are nineteen blessings in the Shemoneh Esreh. - We do, however, still call the prayer the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, based on its original eighteen blessings.

In <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 2:10, the Rambam explains that we are obligated to rely on the day established Rosh Chodesh by the Jewish court. This matter was handed over to them completely. God, who commanded the observance of the holiday, commanded us to rely on them.
This concept is based on the verse in Leviticus 23:4: ""These are the appointed days of God, sacred days, that you shall designate them in their appointed time.""

the third with <i>Shofarot</i> - [describing the blowing of the shofar.]<br>O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 16a relates:
Rabbi Abahu asks: ""Why do we blow with the shofar of a ram? As the Holy One blessed be He said: Blow a ram's horn before Me so that I shall remember the binding of Yitzchak the son of Avraham, and I will consider it as if you bound (and sacrificed) yourselves to Me.""

<i>Malchuyot</i> - ""... The King over all the Earth who sanctifies Israel and the Day of Remembrance"" (This conclusion is also used for the intermediate blessing in all the prayers of Rosh Hashanah.)<br>
<i>Zichronot</i> - ""...The One who remembers the Covenant.”<br>
<i>Shofarot</i> - ""...The One who hears the <i>Teru'ah”</i> - based on Leviticus 23:24.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.9,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 2,"Before the first blessing of each and every Amidah-prayer, one states: ""God, open my lips, and my mouth will utter Your praise"" [Psalms 51:17]. Upon concluding the prayer, he says: ""May the utterances of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be in accordance with Your will, O God, my Rock and Redeemer"" [Psalms 19:15], and then steps backwards.","Before the first blessing of each and every prayer, one states: ""God, open my lips, and my mouth will utter Your praise"" [Psalms 51:17]"," See <i>Berachot</i> 4b which quotes Rabbi Yochanan as requiring this verse to be recited before every prayer.
Rabbenu Yonah explains that this verse must be understood in conjunction with the verse that follows it: ""You do not desire that I offer sacrifices; a burnt offering, You do not want:"" (Psalms 51:18 . After his relations with Bathsheva, King David realized that he could not attain forgiveness by offering a sacrifice, since a sacrifice is accepted only after an act done unwittingly. Therefore, he asked that God assist him in finding the proper means of expression through prayer to achieve atonement.
We, too, are in a similar situation for we have no Temple and our prayers were instituted in the place of our sacrifices. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 5.) Accordingly, we ask God to assist us in our desire to utter His praises, and request our needs in such a way that it will be desirable to Him.
<i>Berachot</i> 4b raises a question regarding the recitation of this verse before <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Rabbi Yochanan himself states that one who starts the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> immediately after the blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, גאל ישראל (Who redeemed Israel) is called a person of the World to Come. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 18, where the Rambam mentions this halachah.)
Why is the recitation of this verse not considered an interruption between the blessing and the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>? The Talmud answers that this verse is considered as an integral part of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and thus, is viewed as a ""long prayer.""

However, the Rambam's interpretation of this passage differs from that of other commentaries.
Both Rashi and Rabbenu Nissim interpret ""concluding with Sabbath"" to mean that the <i>chatimah</i> of the middle blessing should be ""... who sanctifies the Sabbath,"" with no mention of Rosh Chodesh or the relevant festival. In contrast, the Rambam maintains that this refers to the text of the blessing itself and not the <i>chatimah</i>.
[It is interesting to note that the position which states that in the <i>chatimah</i> of the blessing one need mention only Sabbath does have halachic importance. The <i>Bi'ur Halachah, Orach Chayim</i> 487, rules that a person who forgets to insert the end of the <i>chatimah</i> ""...Israel and the appointed times"" on the Sabbath of Chol HaMoed and only mentions the Sabbath fulfills his obligation בדיעבד - i.e., after the fact, the mention of Sabbath alone is enough.

The halachah follows Rabbi Yehudah's position. Even though the beginning of Sukkot is also the beginning of the rainy season, we do not mention rain until the end of Sukkot, since rain on Sukkot is a bad omen. <i>Sukkah</i> 28b-29a draws a comparison to a servant who brings his master wine only to have the wine spilled in his face - i.e., we build our sukkot in order to serve our Master, but He causes the rain to fall, as if to say that He does not desire our service and requests that we leave His presence.

One does not make any special mention of remembrances in the first three or last three [blessings], except on the holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur themselves alone. And even on these days, they allowed it only with difficulty.
The """"remembrances"" referred to in the Mishnah are the very additions mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah.

However, the general practice is to add these special prayers on all ten days. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 602.)
The difficulty regarding these additions stems from <i>Berachot</i> 34a which states that one may not add any special requests in the first three or last three blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. (See Chapter 6, Halachah 3.) However, Rabbi Yitzchak ibn Gayut explains that since these remembrances are relevant to the needs of the entire community, they may be recited in the first three and last three blessings. <i>Berachot</i> (ibid.) prohibits only requests made by an individual for his personal needs.

The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> explains that the priests recite <i>Y'varechecha</i> - the first word of the priestly blessings - directly after concluding the blessing (see Halachah 12) recited before blessing the people, without being prompted by the reader. They take the initiative, so that an interruption is not made between the recitation of the blessing before the performance of a mitzvah and its actual performance.
Study of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) shows that the Rambam himself had questions about this matter. In the first manuscripts, the Rambam writes that ""the leader of the congregation recites <i>Y'varechecha</i>, and the priests read after him."" This is also the reading in the popularly published edition of that text. However, in the later manuscripts of the Commentary on the Mishnah (see Rav Kapach's edition of that text), the Rambam changes his mind and states that the priests begin reciting <i>y'varechecha</i>.
In his <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128), Rav Yosef Karo mentions these different views, and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (128:13) rules that the priests begin on their own initiative. The Ramah differs and states that it is Ashkenazic practice that this word is also recited in response to the <i>chazan</i>.

The Rambam addresses himself to this question in one of his responsa and explains that there is nothing wrong with another member of the congregation calling the priests.

Since calling the priests is a necessary element of the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is not considered an interruption to the <i>chazan's</i> prayers.

This is dependent on the discussion (See commentary, Halachah 2) regarding the extent of the obligation to read <i>Shema</i> required by the Torah. Rabbi Meir understands intention to be absolutely necessary only for the first verse and this opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 60:5.
</i>ithout intention, does not fulfill his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and must therefore recite the <i>Shema</i> again.
</i>. [One who recites] the rest without intention<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The definition of the term ""intention"" is the subject of much discussion by the Rabbis.
There is a dispute among the <i>Rishonim</i> regarding whether the performance of commandments requires intention, i.e., must a person have in mind that he is performing the required act in fulfillment of God's command or not? The Rambam (See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4 and note <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:4, and the commentary of the Moznaim editions of those Halachot) maintains that it is necessary to have such an intention. This opinion is also supported by Rabbenu Yitchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher and is accepted as Halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60:4, 598:8). [The dissenting opinions are held by the Rashba and others.]
However, concerning the first verse of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, an extra level of concentration is required. In addition to the intent to carry out God's command, the <i>Shema</i> must be read in fear and awe, trembling and trepidation. One accepts upon oneself the kingship of Heaven and proclaims the unity of God. It is unthinkable that at such a time, one would not focus his attention on the words he is uttering, but would rather think of mundane matters. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 60:5.)
Each day one should imagine that he is reciting <i>Shema Yisrael</i> for the first time, and not as if he had heard it many times before (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:1,2).
<i>Kri'at Shema</i> contains 248 words (245 of the three sections, plus the three extra words of <i>Ado-nai Elo-heichem Emet</i> repeated upon completion of the third section). This corresponds to the 248 positive commandments in the Torah and the 248 limbs of the human body (<i>Midrash Ne'elam</i>; quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:3.) Thus, the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, with its affirmation of God's kingship and Unity, imbues the totality of one's being with these fundamental concepts.
</i> fulfills his obligation.<br>Even a person studying Torah in his usual way or proofreading these portions at the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> fulfills his obligation provided he concentrates his intention for the first verse.",[One who recites] the rest without intention fulfills his obligation," Needless to say, it is not desirable to read the <i>Shema</i> in this manner and, at the outset, one should attempt to read the entire <i>Shema</i> with proper concentration.

There is an apparent difficulty with the Rambam's statements. Halachah 5 states that one must interrupt Torah study in order to recite the <i>Shema</i>, and yet, in this halachah, such mundane matters as eating and haircuts are deemed sufficient reasons to postpone <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the study of Torah is interrupted, since, indeed, the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> need not be understood as an interruption at all. Since <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is in itself a section of the Torah, its reading can be likened to the study of Torah. However, in the case of the mundane activities mentioned in our halachah, <i>Kri'at Shema</i> would involve a complete interruption. Therefore, it is not necessary to stop.

The latter explain that the word <i>Shema</i> - literally, ""hear,"" - indicates the acceptability of any language that one hears - i.e., understands.

The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and prohibits one from reading the <i>Shema</i> in a foreign language. Since any translation is a commentary, he feels that it is impossible to read with the necessary care. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 62:2 quotes the Rambam's opinion as halachah.
Nevertheless, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (62:3) points out that although the halachah is indeed that one may recite the <i>Shema</i>, grace after meals, the silent Amidah, and Kiddush on Shabbat in any language, at present, it is highly preferable to say them all in Hebrew. This is even the case for someone who does not understand Hebrew since a proper translation is very difficult, and the true meaning of the prayers will be lost. He points out that certain words (e.g., <i>totafot</i>) are indeed impossible to translate.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 65:1 quotes the Rambam's statements as halachah. The Ramah adds, however, that were one to be unavoidably detained during the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> for a period long enough to finish the entire <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, he must recite it again. Such an interruption is considered significant, since even if he had wanted to finish the <i>Shema</i>, he would have been unable to do so.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> points out that the Ramah's position would apply only in the case that one were unavoidably detained by the need to relieve himself, or that he suddenly found himself in a place unfit for the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.

This certainly seems to differentiate between those before and after the coffin, and indicates clearly that those who have already carried the coffin are indeed obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, unlike the halachah written by the Rambam.
Rashi explains that those who have already carried the coffin are obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, even though they may be needed to carry it again, because they have already fulfilled their obligation.
There is, however, another version of the Mishnah. See <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 17b and most printed versions of the Mishnah (Rabbinic edition, Kahati, Mossad Harav Kook edition of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah). It states:
The bearers of the coffin and their replacements and those who in turn will relieve the replacements, the ones before the coffin and the ones after the coffin - the ones who are required to [carry] the coffin - are exempt. And those who are not required to [carry] the coffin are obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.""
The Mishnah in this form can serve as the source for the Rambam's halachah. The ""are exempt"" term in the halachah refers back to all the cases written before it, including ""the ones after the coffin.""
The difference in the original Hebrew versions of the Mishnah is simply one word. Rashi's version:<br>

T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Yonah explains that not only the burial of the dead, but also the consoling of the mourners is part of the commandment of גמילות חסדים (acts of lovingkindness). In his commentary on <i>Mishnah Pe'ah</i> 1:1, the Rambam divides acts of lovingkindness into two categories: a) those one does with his money, such as charity,<br>
b) those one does with his body - e.g., comforting mourners and accompanying the dead to burial.
Rabbenu Yonah states explicitly that this is a Torah commandment. The Rambam, however, is of the opinion that burying the dead, comforting the mourners, and all acts of lovingkindness are Rabbinic commandments. In <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 14:1, he writes:
It is a positive commandment of Rabbinic origin to visit the sick, comfort those mourning, take out the dead, bring in the bride, accompany guests [from your house] and to involve oneself in those things necessary for burial - i.e., to carry [the coffin] on his shoulders, to walk before him, to eulogize him, to dig [the grave] and to bury him.
The Rambam's classification of these commandments as of Rabbinic origin creates a problem for us. How are we to understand the halachot we have just learned?
The Rambam has taught us that those involved in the burial of the dead and the comforting of the mourners are exempt from reciting the <i>Shema</i>, based on the principle that those involved in the performance of one commandment are exempt from another. According to Rabbenu Yonah, who understands גמילות חסד (acts of lovingkindness) to be Torah commandments, this is easily comprehended. However, according to the Rambam, how can involvement in a Rabbinic commandment exempt one from the fulfillment of a Torah obligation, especially one as central as <i>Kri'at Shema</i>?
The answer to this question depends on the continuation of <i>Hilchot Eivel</i>, <i>ibid.</i>:
Even though all these commandments are of Rabbinic origin, they are included [in the command] ואהבת לרעך כמוך (Love your fellow as yourself, Leviticus 19:18 . All those things that you would want others to do for you in the realm of Torah and commandments, you should do for your colleague.
Thus, the Rabbinic commandments regarding acts of lovingkindness are the specific ways established by the sages to express the Torah commandment of ""Love your fellow as yourself."" Accordingly, although these commandments are Rabbinic in origin, since their ultimate source is found in a Torah commandment, the rule that ""one performing one commandment is exempt from another"" applies to them as well.

</i>. [In contrast,] should one sound a shofar belonging to an apostate city, one has not fulfilled one's obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a explains that the difference between a shofar of idol worship and one of an apostate city is that all the property within the latter must be destroyed. Since ultimately this shofar must be burnt, even before it is actually destroyed it is no longer considered to be an existent entity. Thus, we may not use it on Rosh HaShanah, because a shofar used for the mitzvah must be of a specific size - slightly larger than one's hand, as mentioned in Halachah 5 - and a nonexistent entity has no size at all.
A shofar of idol worship must also be destroyed. However, should the gentile negate its connection to idol worship before it is acquired by a Jew, it need not be destroyed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8. Since there is a possibility that it will not have to be destroyed, it is considered to be an existent entity and may be used for the mitzvah.
This principle applies only to aspects of idol worship belonging to a gentile. It is impossible to negate the connection between an idol worshiped by a Jew and its forbidden nature. (See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:9.) Hence, a Jew's shofar of idol worship may not be used. Similarly, if a Jew has acquired a shofar of idol worship that belonged to a gentile before the latter negated its connection to idol worship, the Jew is no longer capable of negating this connection. Therefore, such a shofar may not be used on Rosh HaShanah.
Also, once an animal has been sacrificed to an idol, there is no possibility of negating its connection to idol worship. Hence, its horn may not be used as a shofar.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:3-4) quotes all the above laws as halachah. The Ramah relates that certain authorities recommend not using even a gentile's shofar of idol worship unless we know that he negated its connection with idol worship before Rosh HaShanah begins.

Since ultimately this shofar must be burnt, even before it is actually destroyed it is no longer considered to be an existent entity. Thus, we may not use it on Rosh HaShanah, because a shofar used for the mitzvah must be of a specific size - slightly larger than one's hand, as mentioned in Halachah 5 - and a nonexistent entity has no size at all.
A shofar of idol worship must also be destroyed. However, should the gentile negate its connection to idol worship before it is acquired by a Jew, it need not be destroyed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8. Since there is a possibility that it will not have to be destroyed, it is considered to be an existent entity and may be used for the mitzvah.
This principle applies only to aspects of idol worship belonging to a gentile. It is impossible to negate the connection between an idol worshiped by a Jew and its forbidden nature. (See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:9.) Hence, a Jew's shofar of idol worship may not be used. Similarly, if a Jew has acquired a shofar of idol worship that belonged to a gentile before the latter negated its connection to idol worship, the Jew is no longer capable of negating this connection. Therefore, such a shofar may not be used on Rosh HaShanah.
Also, once an animal has been sacrificed to an idol, there is no possibility of negating its connection to idol worship. Hence, its horn may not be used as a shofar.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:3-4) quotes all the above laws as halachah. The Ramah relates that certain authorities recommend not using even a gentile's shofar of idol worship unless we know that he negated its connection with idol worship before Rosh HaShanah begins.

If you ask: ""Behold, he has derived benefit from hearing [the shofar's] sound?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the laws of מעילה do not apply to sound, there is still a Rabbinic prohibition against benefiting from the sound of consecrated articles. Therefore, one might think that we would be unable to fulfill the mitzvah with such a shofar (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). Accordingly, the Rambam explains:
</i>"" - mitzvot were not given for our benefit.<br>Based on this concept, a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the <i>teki'ot</i> required to fulfill the mitzvah.",Mitzvot were not given for our benefit," Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) states: ""the mitzvot were not given to the Jewish people for their enjoyment, but rather as a yoke.""
This concept has relevance in the ethical, as well as the halachic sphere. In the tenth chapter of <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, the Rambam writes:

One who serves [God] out of love occupies himself with the Torah and the mitzvot...for no ulterior motive, not because of fear that evil will occur, nor in order to acquire benefit...
The great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: ""Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a gift. Rather, since he is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him""; i.e., serve [Him] out of love.

The above is not intended to imply that a person should not feel happy and fulfilled in the service of God. Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service. We should be totally committed to fulfilling God's will, and the expression of that commitment should generate satisfaction and joy.
<b>Based on this concept -</b> that mitzvot were not given for our benefit;
<b>a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the teki'ot required to fulfill the mitzvah. -</b> Doing so is not considered a violation of his vow.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:5) advises that the person who took the vow should not blow the shofar himself [because many consider that to be a pleasurable experience (<i>Taz</i>)]. Rather, he should hear the <i>teki'ot</i> from a colleague.
Also, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) notes that if a person specifically states that he vows not to listen to a colleague's <i>teki'ot</i>, he may not hear that person blow the shofar on Rosh HaShanah, because a vow (<i>neder</i>) can also negate a mitzvah. (See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:6-8.)

Though these prohibitions are of Rabbinic origin, the Sages reinforced the power of their decrees and equated them with Torah law. Hence, just as one may not violate a <i>melachah</i> forbidden by the Torah to obtain a shofar, so, too, it is forbidden to violate a <i>sh'vut</i> forbidden by Rabbinic law (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

Two contrasting interpretations are offered to explain the difference.
Some maintain that as long as the entire length (or the majority of the length) of the shofar is not cracked, the shofar is not disqualified. Others maintain that even the slightest crack along the length of the shofar disqualifies it, because the pressure of the blowing will cause the crack to grow until, ultimately, the entire shofar will be cracked (Rabbenu Asher; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 586:8).
Concerning <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, both the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (586:8) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (586:43) write that when no other shofar is available, one may rely on the first opinion.

Rabbenu Asher interprets the passage differently. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) favors the Rambam's interpretation, but states that under difficult circumstances, when no other shofar is available, one may rely on Rabbenu Asher's interpretation.
<b>If one [merely] perforated the insides of the horn, -</b> the bonelike tissue inside the horn
<b>[but did not remove them,] it is kosher, because a substance of the same kind is not considered an intervening entity. -</b> The presence of a foreign substance inside the shofar would cause it to be disqualified, as stated in the following halachah. However, since this tissue is considered to be part of the horn itself, the shofar is acceptable.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 586:15) quotes this law, but also adds that if one removed this tissue from the horn and then hollowed it out, the tissue would be unacceptable for use as a shofar.
<b>Should one stick together fragments of shofarot until one has constructed a shofar, it is unacceptable. -</b> <i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a explains that this construction is not called a shofar. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 10) states that this law applies even if the fragment of the shofar closest to one's mouth is of sufficient size to be considered a kosher shofar itself.

The Radbaz (Vol. IV, Responsum 1365) states that although the Rambam requires that we wash before the afternoon and evening services, a blessing should be recited only when washing before the morning service. This opinion is reinforced by the fact that, when counting the hundred blessings recited each day (<i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 7:14), the Rambam enumerates only one blessing for washing for prayer.

5. I.e., whether before a meal or in preparation for prayer.<br>
6. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this expression indicates that it is not necessary to wash one's hands a second time (see the commentary on the previous halachah) or to dry them before partaking of the food. When washing one's hands for food, this is required because the water used for the first washing that remains on the hands becomes ritually impure. In contrast, the water that remains on one's hands after immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> is pure. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:19.)<br>
7. A <i>mikveh</i> must have at least 40 <i>se'ah</i> of water that has flowed into it by natural means. In contemporary measurements, 331 liters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 648 liters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this applies only to water that does not emanate from a natural spring. When a person immerses his hands in such a spring, all that is necessary is that there be sufficient water to cover his hands. (See also <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 9:8.)
Significantly, Rabbenu Yonah maintains that it is acceptable to immerse one's hands in a <i>mikveh</i> containing even less than 40 <i>se'ah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:14) accepts this view, although the Ramah favors the Rambam's position.
8. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, and maintains that one may immerse one's hands in water poured into a pool in the ground. He supports his position by referring to the immersion of a <i>ba'al keri</i> (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4-5), which is acceptable even in such pool. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Mikveot</i> 8:1.) Nevertheless, most authorities accept the Rambam's decision. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 159:23; <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 159.)<br>
 9. See Halachot 7-9.<br>
10. See Halachot 4 and 10.<br>
11. See Halachot 11-12. The Rashba quotes the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> as explaining that it is necessary to wash with a vessel, because the washing of hands is derived from the sanctification of the priest's hands in the Temple.<br>
12. See Halachot 13-14.<br>
13. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) states that this concept is derived from the laws of the <i>ki'or</i> (the basin in the Temple from which the priests washed their hands). If its water changed color, it could no longer be used.<br>
14. E.g., ink or another coloring fell into it.<br>
15. It became rusty from a metal container. Note, however, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:22, which state that water that has become murky from mud or dirt is acceptable, because even this is often the color of natural stream water.
If after water was disqualified because of an abnormal color, its color reverts to the norm, it can be used to wash one's hands (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:5).
16. See <i>Hilchot Rotzeach USh'mirat HaNefesh</i> 11:6-16, which discusseshe prohibition of water left uncovered. This prohibition was enacted out of fear of the possibility that a poisonous snake or the like released venom into the water.<br>
17. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 30b states that washing with such water could be dangerous lest the venom seep into cuts or sores or even through the body's pores. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) notes that since the presence of poisonous snakes and the like is no longer widespread, the prohibition against drinking - and hence, washing with - such water need not be observed at present. This ruling is accepted by the later authorities.<br>
18. The Rambam is implying that the water in a <i>mikveh</i> or in a natural stream remains acceptable for washing although it was used for other tasks (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>
19. If, however, the bread fell into the water accidentally, the water is not disqualified (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:8).<br>
20. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:2) states that even if the baker washed his hands in the water, the water does not become unacceptable. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (160:3) refutes this ruling. His opinion is accepted by the later authorities.<br>
 21. Slightly murky water is acceptable, as mentioned above. The determining factor is whether or not a dog will drink from the water.<br>
22. Since a <i>mikveh</i> containing such water is acceptable for the immersion of one's entire body, it is surely acceptable for the immersion of hands, which is only a Rabbinic commandment.<br>
23. These hot springs have a high mineral content and are very bitter.<br>
24. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this as referring to a stream that was diverted into a trench that does not contain forty <i>se'ah</i>. Although logically, this would be acceptable for the immersion of hands, the Sages forbade using such water, lest one also immerse one's hands in a container of water. Significantly, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:7), Rav Yosef Karo adds a further point, that the water was cut off from its source.<br>
25. I.e., the washing before partaking of bread.<br>
26. I.e., the washing after the meal (see Halachah 17); alternatively, the second pouring of water over one's hands, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4. Note the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.<br>
 27. In both instances, one must pour at least a <i>revi'it</i> of water over one's hands in a single pouring. In the first instance, while the water is being poured one gradually moves one's hands under the water, while in the second instance, one pours hurriedly, but forcefully, over the entire hand at once.<br>
28. I.e., several people stand with their hands outstretched, and a person passes in front of them pouring water over their hands.<br>
29. Although the water first passes over the hands of one person, it is still acceptable for the person whose hands are held below, because as long as it contains the required quantity and comes in one continuous stream, it does not become impure.
Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:16 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:68,72 state that the two people must originally have the intention to wash their hands as one, and must hold their hands close together. Otherwise, it is considered as if the second person washed with the water that was rendered impure by the first person's washing.
30. Note the difference of opinion on this issue between the Rambam and the other Halachic authorities mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4.

The Rambam, however, does not mention this perspective in these halachot, nor in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i>, Chapter 9, where he discusses the prohibition against the worship of false gods as it affects gentiles. [In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 2), however, he states ""Israel is commanded regarding the unification of God""; from which it could be inferred that gentiles need not believe in this concept and can combine their worship of God with other powers.] All authorities agree that such worship is forbidden for Jews.

In the following halachah and in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7), the Rambam mentions the second view. It is, however, unclear if this was the original intent of the star-worshipers or whether this was a later development.

See also the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. II, Chapter 36) where the Rambam describes how people can be overcome by their powers of imagination to the extent that they - as do others who see them in such a trance - think of themselves as prophets, although, in fact, they received no Divine influence.

People would serve images with strange practices - one more distorted than the other - offer sacrifices to them, and bow down to them.

At first - as explained in Halachah 1 - star worship was not institutionalized, but was practiced by individuals because of their mistaken conceptions.
The second phase involved the development of religious institutions and set modes of worship. The leaders, however, still recognized God and attributed the instructions to worship the stars to Him. In the third stage - as the latter portion of this halachah states - people would worship the stars and idols without any awareness of God.

Therefore, he began to worship the earth. Then he saw that the earth needs rain, and began to worship the sky. Later, he saw that the most brilliant creation in the sky was the sun, and began to worship it. Afterwards, when the sun set and the moon rose, he began to worship the moon. When the sun rose the next morning, he did not know what to do. He did not see which was stronger: the sun or the moon. So Abraham continued in a quandary, questioning who was the true God.

He knew that the entire world was making a mistake. What caused them to err was their service of the stars and images, which made them lose awareness of the truth.<br>Abraham was forty years old when he became aware of his Creator. When he recognized and knew Him, he began to formulate replies to the inhabitants of Ur Kasdim and debate with them, telling them that they were not following a proper path.<br>He broke their idols and began to teach the people that it is fitting to serve only the God of the world. To Him [alone] is it fitting to bow down, sacrifice, and offer libations, so that the people of future [generations] would recognize Him. [Conversely,] it is fitting to destroy and break all the images, lest all the people err concerning them, like those people who thought that there are no other gods besides these [images].<br>When he overcame them through the strength of his arguments, the king desired to kill him. He was [saved through] a miracle and left for Charan. [There,] he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world and it is proper to serve Him. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country, until he came to the land of Canaan - proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: ""And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God.""<br>When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth.

This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation within the world which knew God.<br>When the Jews extended their stay in Egypt, however, they learned from the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did, with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods.<br>Within a short time, the fundamental principle that Abraham had planted would have been uprooted, and the descendants of Jacob would have returned to the errors of the world and their crookedness. Because of God's love for us, and to uphold the oath He made to Abraham, our patriarch, He brought forth Moses, our teacher, the master of all prophets, and sent him [to redeem the Jews].

(See <i>Sha'agat Aryeh</i>, 13.)
This would explain the omission of this commandment from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>.

The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, however, disagrees with this opinion. In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 67, he states that even the daily obligation requires an explicit statement. Nevertheless, he explains that it was not chosen as one of the 613 commandments because the obligation to remember the exodus twice daily is not stated in the form of a command in the Torah to ""Remember,"" but rather, as a reason for another mitzvah (the mitzvah of <i>matzah</i>): ""In order that you shall remember...""

See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 21), and <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i>, Chapters 7 and 8.
According to some opinions, one can differentiate between the two obligations as follows: A person can fulfill his daily obligation with simply a thought about the exodus, whereas on <i>Pesach</i> night the mitzvah can be performed only through the verbal description of the redemption from Egypt. (See <i>Sha'agat Aryeh</i>, 13.)
This would explain the omission of this commandment from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. A commandment that can be fulfilled with a thought alone and not an explicit statement or action is not ""worthy"" of inclusion in the list of 613 commandments of the Torah. (See the Rambam's explanation of the commandment to remember Amalek: Positive Commandment 189).
The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, however, disagrees with this opinion. In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 67, he states that even the daily obligation requires an explicit statement. Nevertheless, he explains that it was not chosen as one of the 613 commandments because the obligation to remember the exodus twice daily is not stated in the form of a command in the Torah to ""Remember,"" but rather, as a reason for another mitzvah (the mitzvah of <i>matzah</i>): ""In order that you shall remember..."" (Deuteronomy 16:3 .
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> ""I am God, your Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt to be your Lord, I am God, your Lord"" (Numbers 15:41 .
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the mention of the exodus can itself be understood as the reason for the inclusion of this section in <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, mentions <i>tzitzit</i> as the basis for the presence of this section in <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Halachah 2), since it is the <i>tzitzit</i> that cause us to remember all the commandments.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Numbers 15:39 states: ""And you shall see them..."" - implying that <i>tzitzit</i> must only be worn when they can be seen, i.e., daytime. Accordingly, there is no obligation to wear <i>tzitzit</i> at night. See <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:7-8.
</i>evertheless, we recite [the section describing] it at night because it contains mention of the exodus from Egypt.<br>We are commanded to mention the exodus both during the day and at night as [Deuteronomy 16:3] states: ""In order that you shall remember the day of your leaving the land of Egypt all the days of your life<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The word ""all"" includes even the nighttime.
The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshat Vayakhel</i> 216b) explains the mystical significance of mentioning the exodus from Egypt after proclaiming the unity of God.
</i>.""<br>Reading these three sections in this order constitutes the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.",The reading of these three sections in this order constitutes the recitation of the Shema," The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:5) mentions that the sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> also contain a reference to each of the 10 utterances of the revelation at Mount Sinai (Exodus 20:1-14), thus representing a complete statement of Jewish spirituality and values.

</i>","In the day, one recites two blessings before it and one after it. At night, one recites two blessings before and two blessings after it"," There are a total of seven blessings associated with the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, three in the day and four at night. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:5) bases this on the verse ""Seven (times) in the day will I praise you"" (Psalms 119:164 .
The <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 49, discusses the reasons for these blessings at length, noting that, on the surface, they are not related to the <i>Shema</i> at all. That text explains that the basic intent of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is to attain the love for God as described in the verse, ""And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength.""
To reach such a level, one must first contemplate the greatness of God. Accordingly, in the first blessing, we outline the praises of God uttered by the angels, who are of supreme intelligence and spiritual wisdom. These lofty creatures proclaim God's greatness and abnegate themselves completely to Him, stating that He transcends even their ability to understand.
Then, in the second blessing, we describe God's great love for the Jewish people, as manifested by His giving us His Torah and choosing us as His people.
Having contemplated such ideas, we are prepared to reciprocate God's love for us by proclaiming our love for Him. We recognize His infinite Greatness and Unity, see His Providence in the events of our life, and internalize our intellectual understanding into an emotional outpouring for our Creator.

We must understand the present halachah in this context. Only when one deviates from the <i>p'tichah</i> or <i>chatimah</i> of a blessing does the Rambam require the recitation of another blessing.

The commandment [starts] from the time of the appearance of the stars<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) states that the time for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> begins at the hour when a priest who has become ritually impure may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and resume eating <i>terumah</i>. The Talmud explains that this is the time when the stars appear.
<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) holds that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited earlier, during the last hour before sunset. This is based on the understanding that Rabbi Yehudah, who disagrees with the majority opinion regarding the proper time for the afternoon prayer, also disagrees about the proper time for the evening prayer and <i>Kri'at Shema</i> contained therein. (See <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 235.) This will be discussed at length in <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 3:6.
There are several different positions regarding the precise definition of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). It generally refers to the appearance of three medium-sized stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 235:1 requires the sighting of three small stars before reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of צאת הכוכבים, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night.
There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.
The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines צאת הכוכבים as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.
There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary to the mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 3:2, maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.
Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars is 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that צאת הכוכבים is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.
According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other.
</i>...<br>A person who transgresses and delays fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn. [The Sages established the limit] of midnight only in order to distance us from negligent wrongdoing.",[and continues] until midnight," There are three positions recorded in the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 2a regarding the time until which one may recite the <i>Shema</i> at night.
Rabbi Eliezer says until the end of the first of the three watches of the Temple - i.e., one third of the night, which is until approximately 9:30 pm. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. The Mishnah then explains that the Sages' opinion is, in effect, that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> until dawn, but that they mentioned midnight as a preferred time in order to distance people from transgression. This is the source of this halachah in the Rambam.
The <i>Rosh</i> and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 235) hold that the halachah follows Rabban Gamliel's position, and that a priori (לכתחילה), a person may read the <i>Shema</i> at night until dawn. The Rambam sees the Sages' position as halachically valid, and therefore one may rely on Rabban Gamliel only after the fact (בדיעבד). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 235:3 quotes the Rambam's position. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah 235:34-35.)<br></i>

For example, if there were 18 hours of daylight and 6 hours of darkness on a given day, each ""hour"" of the day would be 18/12 hours (or 90 minutes), and each ""hour"" of the night would be 6/12 hour (or 30 minutes).
There is a disagreement regarding how to calculate the durations of daylight and nighttime. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> holds that daylight is divided into 12 equal parts from dawn until the appearance of the stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> hold that daylight is determined from sunrise to sunset.
Therefore, the end of the third hour according to the <i>Magen Avraham</i> is earlier than that of the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i>, and even though each ""hour"" is longer, it is calculated from dawn, which is at least 72 minutes before sunrise. (See the commentary on Halachah 9.)

We must say that the Rambam understands Rabbi Yehoshua's position as secondary and that, at the outset, one should recite the <i>Shema</i> 6 minutes before sunrise. Indeed, in his responsa, he writes that it it is preferable to read the <i>Shema</i> without a <i>minyan</i> before sunrise, than to wait until after sunrise to recite it together with a <i>minyan</i>.
The majority of <i>Rishonim</i> (see Rabbenu Asher on <i>Berachot</i> 9b and <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 58) disagree with the Rambam and understand that although reciting <i>Kriat Shema</i> just prior to sunrise is the most desirable method of fulfilling one's obligation (מצוה מן המובחר), the actual commandment is from before sunrise (i.e., the time at which one can recognize his friend 6 feet away) to the end of the third hour. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 58:1 and the definition there regarding the proper time for the commandment.)

The obligation to search for chametz in the midst of the festival emphasizes that the Rambam conceives that the mitzvah to destroy chametz applies, not only before Pesach begins, but throughout the holiday. Indeed, this concept can be seen in the Rambam's words describing the mitzvah in the preface to this text. There, he explains that the mitzvah is to destroy chametz ""from"" and not ""on"" the fourteenth of Nisan.
[It must be noted that the adoption of such a position represents a change of mind for the Rambam. In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 156) and in the earlier handwritten texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam writes that the mitzvah is to destroy chametz ""on the fourteenth.""]
The definition of the term ""in the midst of the festival"" is the subject of debate among the commentaries. Some define it as ""in the midst of Chol HaMoed,"" explaining that since chametz is <i>muktzeh</i> and cannot be moved or destroyed on the first day of the festival, there is no need to search for it at that time (Rabbenu Manoach).
Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 435:1) and the other Ashkenazic halachic authorities require a search on the first day of Pesach itself even though it is Yom Tov. Should chametz be found, it should be covered with a utensil.

The Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah is significant. Our Rabbis have offered two definitions of the mitzvah of resting on the Sabbath: In his commentary on <i>Yevamot</i> 6a, the Rashba states that the mitzvah is negative in nature: one refrains from performing prohibited labors. In contrast, in his commentary on Leviticus 23:24, the Ramban explains that the mitzvah possesses a positive dimension: to spend the day in a restful frame of mind, abstaining from all activities - even those that are not forbidden labors - which would disrupt this tranquility.
From the Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah, it would appear that he follows the first view. From his statements in Chapter 21, Halachah 1, however, it would appear that he accepts the second perspective. (See also <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>.)

Accordingly, as explained below, if one's father is also a Torah sage, he should be given priority. However, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that where there is no danger to life or property, and only honor is involved, priority should be given to one's teacher, even if one's father is a Torah sage of equivalent stature.

[The following rule applies when] one sees a lost object belonging to his teacher and a lost object belonging to his father: If his father was equal in stature to his teacher, his father's [lost article] is given precedence. If not, his teacher's is given precedence.<br>
This applies only to a person's primary teacher, from whom he learned the majority of his wisdom.
The text of <i>Bava Metzia</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the source for this decision, is closer to the text in <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i>. Indeed, on that basis, the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> and others maintain that our text contains a printing error. However, that conclusion is difficult to accept, since in his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Keritot</i> <i>ibid.</i>, the Rambam gives a father who is a Torah sage priority over a person's teacher, without requiring that the father be of greater stature.
The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that our text refers to a situation when it is possible to retrieve both lost objects, and the only question is whose is given priority. In contrast, <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> refers to a situation where it is possible to return only one of the lost objects.
Alternatively, the Tashbaytz (Responsa, Vol. III, 275) and the Radbaz (Responsa, Vol. V, 1493) explain that here we are referring to a father who has also instructed his son (albeit, not to the same degree as his teacher). In contrast, <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> refers to a father who has not instructed his son at all.

In his wisdom, Solomon alluded to them [as follows, (Song of Songs 2:15 ]: ""Take for us foxes, little foxes that spoil the vineyards, [our vineyards are blooming.]""",and places stumbling blocks before the blind," Of course, the Rambam is not referring to those who are physically blind, but rather those who are intellectually unaware or spiritually handicapped, as explained in the interpretation of Leviticus 19:14: ""Do not place a stumbling block before the blind.""

Although <i>Shabbat</i> 23b, the source for this halachah, refers to the two items mentioned in this halachah together, there is no necessity for the Rambam to do so. On the contrary, the Rambam structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> subject by subject. Seemingly, it would have been proper for him to mention this law in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>. [Indeed, the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 263:3) mention this law in connection with the laws of the Sabbath as well.]
By structuring his text in this manner, however, the Rambam indicates that the priority of kindling Sabbath candles stems not from a particular law associated with the Sabbath, but rather from a general principle - the importance of peace - which relates to the entire Torah as a whole (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XV).

Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:1, the Rambam mentions that the Sabbath candles contribute to the atmosphere of <i>oneg Shabbat</i>, Sabbath pleasure. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:5, he mentions them as being associated with activities carried out in honor of the Sabbath (<i>k'vod Shabbat</i>). In the laws of the Sabbath itself, the Rambam does not mention the connection between the Sabbath candles and peace within the home.
This relates to the concept mentioned previously, that the peace generated by the Sabbath candles relates to the Torah as a whole and not to the Sabbath in particular (<i>Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.</i>).

The mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 33b, states:
Just as the leader of the congregation is obligated [to pray], each individual is obligated. Rabban Gamliel states: ""The leader of the congregation fulfills the obligation on behalf of the community.""
The Talmud (34b) elaborates on the difference of opinion:
They asked Rabban Gamliel: ""According to your opinion, why does the community pray?""<br>
He replied: ""In order to allow the leader of the community to prepare his prayers.""<br>
Rabban Gamliel asked them: ""According to your opinion, why does the leader of the congregation pray aloud?""<br>
They replied: ""In order to allow those who are not knowledgeable to fulfill their obligation.""<br>
He told them: ""Just as he fulfills the obligation on behalf of those who are not knowledgeable, he fulfills it on behalf of those who are knowledgeable.""
The Sages of the Talmud continued to debate the issue. The ultimate decision accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, the Rambam (See Halachah 9), and Rabbenu Asher, is that during the entire year, the Sages' opinion is accepted. However, on Rosh HaShanah, because of the complexity of the blessings (See Halachah 10), Rabban Gamliel's opinion prevails.
Both Rabban Gamliel and the Sages agree that the practice of communal prayer involves two elements:<br>
a) the silent prayers of many individuals; and<br>
b) the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br>
They differ, however, as to which of these elements is considered of primary importance. According to the Sages, the essential element of communal prayer is that ten or more people recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the same time. According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.
[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]
The Rambam's statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.
In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam's statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan's</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9). By doing so, one will have both the advantages of individual and communal prayer.

</i> adult<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Males who have reached the age of thirteen years and a day and manifested signs of physical maturity. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:19.)
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this halachah from <i>Berachot</i> 47b-48a which allows for the inclusion of a child in the <i>zimmun</i> for the grace after meals. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:7.) We assume that this leniency was granted only in regard to grace, but not in regard to prayer. See also <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 91:3.
Many Halachic authorities do not accept this conclusion. In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon rules that a child may be counted as the tenth in a <i>minyan</i>. Similarly, the <i>Ba'al HaMe'or</i> holds that even up to four minors may be counted in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted. There are opinions that in such a case, the minor must be at least six years old, understand that prayer is service to God, and hold a <i>chumash</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 55:5, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 55:5).

One of the communal rites listed in <i>Megillah</i> 23b which requires a <i>minyan</i> is ברכת אבלים - the blessing one utters to those in mourning. For the recitation of that blessing, the presence of ten men other than the mourner himself is required. (See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 13:1.) Perhaps the Rambam feels that this statement is necessary to clearly distinguish between the different requirements of a <i>minyan</i> for prayer and ברכת אבלים.
</i>.<br>Even if some of them have already prayed and fulfilled their obligation, they can complete the [quorum of] ten<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though they do not pray together with the others, their presence in the room where the others pray can complete a <i>minyan</i>.

Our Sages in the West say [that <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>barchu</i> may be recited] even with seven. They explain their position [based on Judges 5:2]: ""In the time of tumult in Israel when the people volunteered themselves, blessed be God."" [The number of people correspond] to the number of words [in the verse which describes the blessing of God].<br>
There are those who say only six [are required], since ברכו is the sixth word [of the above verse].
The Rambam differentiates between the ruling regarding prayer and his statements in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:8 where he writes that it is necessary that seven people out of ten eat bread in order to constitute a <i>minyan</i> for <i>zimmun</i>, for ""a noticeable majority"" is required.
There are two views quoted in the name of Rabbenu Tam (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> 23b); one, requiring a minimum of seven people who have not prayed for a <i>minyan</i> just as seven who have eaten bread are required for a <i>minyan</i> in regard to grace after meals and, another, requiring, only five. However, the Rambam's opinion is universally accepted as halachah.
Similarly, we should not recite Kedushah, - See Chapter 7, Halachah 17.
In the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is customary to recite three verses in the <i>Kedushah</i>:<br>
a) ""Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the entire earth is full of His glory"" (Isaiah 6:3 ;<br>
b) ""Blessed be the glory of God from His place"" (Ezekiel 3:12 ;<br>
c) ""The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, throughout all generations"" (Psalms 146:10 .
Only the first two of these verses are recited in the <i>Kedushah</i> of the blessings before the <i>Shema</i>. However, in the<i>Kedushah</i> recited at the end of the service, a verse similar to Psalms 146:10 is also included.
The commentaries debate the definition of <i>Kedushah</i> and therefore, question which passage the Rambam requires to be omitted when one prays alone. The Rambam's statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, appear to define <i>Kedushah</i> as only the first of these three verses.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted. There are opinions that in such a case, the minor must be at least six years old, understand that prayer is service to God, and hold a <i>chumash</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 55:5, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 55:5).
</i> free males<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., excluding a Canaanite slave. However, a Jewish slave (עבד עברי) may be counted as part of a <i>minyan</i>. <i>Berachot</i> 47b relates that once, Rabbi Eliezer entered the synagogue and finding only nine people there, freed his slave to complete the quorum of ten.
</i>. The leader of the congregation is [counted as] one of them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though there is no explicit source to this effect, a number of midrashim (e.g., <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 23:4) lead to this conclusion.
One of the communal rites listed in <i>Megillah</i> 23b which requires a <i>minyan</i> is ברכת אבלים - the blessing one utters to those in mourning. For the recitation of that blessing, the presence of ten men other than the mourner himself is required. (See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 13:1.) Perhaps the Rambam feels that this statement is necessary to clearly distinguish between the different requirements of a <i>minyan</i> for prayer and ברכת אבלים.
</i>.<br>Even if some of them have already prayed and fulfilled their obligation, they can complete the [quorum of] ten<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
Our Sages in the West say [that <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>barchu</i> may be recited] even with seven. They explain their position [based on Judges 5:2]: ""In the time of tumult in Israel when the people volunteered themselves, blessed be God."" [The number of people correspond] to the number of words [in the verse which describes the blessing of God].<br>
There are those who say only six [are required], since ברכו is the sixth word [of the above verse].
The Rambam differentiates between the ruling regarding prayer and his statements in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:8 where he writes that it is necessary that seven people out of ten eat bread in order to constitute a <i>minyan</i> for <i>zimmun</i>, for ""a noticeable majority"" is required.
There are two views quoted in the name of Rabbenu Tam (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> 23b); one, requiring a minimum of seven people who have not prayed for a <i>minyan</i> just as seven who have eaten bread are required for a <i>minyan</i> in regard to grace after meals and, another, requiring, only five. However, the Rambam's opinion is universally accepted as halachah.
Similarly, we should not recite Kedushah, - See Chapter 7, Halachah 17.
In the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is customary to recite three verses in the <i>Kedushah</i>:<br>
a) ""Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the entire earth is full of His glory"" (Isaiah 6:3 ;<br>
b) ""Blessed be the glory of God from His place"" (Ezekiel 3:12 ;<br>
c) ""The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, throughout all generations"" (Psalms 146:10 .
Only the first two of these verses are recited in the <i>Kedushah</i> of the blessings before the <i>Shema</i>. However, in the<i>Kedushah</i> recited at the end of the service, a verse similar to Psalms 146:10 is also included.
The commentaries debate the definition of <i>Kedushah</i> and therefore, question which passage the Rambam requires to be omitted when one prays alone. The Rambam's statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, appear to define <i>Kedushah</i> as only the first of these three verses.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though they do not pray together with the others, their presence in the room where the others pray can complete a <i>minyan</i>.

<i>Zichronot</i> - which describes God's remembrance of His love for the Jews, and<br>
<i>Shofrot</i> - which praises the shofar as a means of manifesting the previous two concepts.
Each of these three blessings includes the recitation of ten verses that express these themes: four from the Torah, three from the prophets, and three from Psalms.

Nevertheless, the commentaries qualify the Rambam's statements, based on <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4:

A person who occupies himself with blowing shofar to learn does not fulfill his obligation... one does not fulfill his obligation until both the person hearing [the shofar] and the one sounding it intend to fulfill the obligation.

In resolution, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage from <i>Keritot</i> 19b.
Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only מתעסק (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities.
Similarly, in the present context, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him. In contrast, since his body did not benefit from hearing the shofar, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears the shofar blown in the proper manner.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 475:4) quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> opinion as regards <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> adds the explanation mentioned in the name of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. (It must be noted that the <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries do not accept this decision). In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 589:8, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes the Rambam's decision concerning blowing the shofar, stating that a מתעסק does not fulfill the mitzvah. Similar decisions are rendered concerning <i>kriat shema</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60) and lulav and etrog (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651).

After the destruction of the Temple, however, every Jew is required to observe them. This obligation is also explicitly stated by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 549:1, 550:1).

</i>, to arouse [their] hearts and initiate [them in] the paths of repentance.

By reminding ourselves of these matters, we will repent and improve [our conduct], as [Leviticus 26:40] states: ""And they will confess their sin and the sin of their ancestors.""",to arrouse [their] hearts and initiate [them in] the paths of repentance," This is the intent of the fasts, and not merely refraining from eating. For this reason, the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 121:1 harshly reproves those who fast, but spend their days taking pleasure strolls and being involved in other forms of leisure activity.

Five tragedies took place on this day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 29a states: Undesirable events are gathered together on a day appropriate for them.

</i>:<br>a) The Tablets were broken;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When Moses descended with the Tablets of the Ten Commandments after being on Mount Sinai for forty days, he beheld the Golden Calf that the Jews had made.

Despite the famine in the city, they would offer two lambs each day as sacrifices. As the siege persisted, their supply of lambs dwindled, and on the Seventeenth of Tammuz, there no longer were any lambs to sacrifice (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:6).
Significantly, other commentaries (Rashi, <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>) on the Mishnah identify the nullification of the sacrifices on the Seventeenth of Tammuz with different events in our history.

Nevertheless, it is the destruction of the city by the Romans that we commemorate by fasting, because the effects of that destruction are more severe (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 549:2). The Rabbis did not institute a fast for the Ninth of Tammuz as well, for it was felt that this would be an excessive burden for the people (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 549:4).
Furthermore, according to the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:8, because of the many difficulties suffered by the Jewish people, they miscalculated the date, and, even during the destruction of the First Temple, it was on the Seventeenth of Tammuz that Jerusalem's walls were breached.

They reveled and wrought havoc there until the afternoon of the ninth of Av, when they set fire to the building. The fire continued burning throughout the tenth of Av.

Fasts 5.5,Ta'aniyot - Chapter 5,"And the entire Jewish people follow the custom of fasting at these times and on the Thirteenth of Adar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this phrase to mean that our obligation to fast on these days is a custom accepted by the Jewish people after the destruction of the Second Temple.

Others maintain that it is improper to fast in a time of war, lest this sap one's strength, and instead the Jews merely vowed to fast, but conducted the actual fasts at a later time.
A third opinion maintains that this refers to the three-day fast that Esther called before approaching Achashverosh. Although this fast was held in the month of Nisan, it is commemorated in connection with the Purim holiday.
</i>, as mentioned [in Esther 9:31]: ""the matter of the fasts and the outcries<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 141:2 writes that the commemoration of this fast makes us conscious of how God ""hears each person's prayer in his time of distress when he fasts and repents... as He did on behalf of our ancestors in those days.""
The fast of the Thirteenth of Adar is also referred to as <i>Ta'anit Esther</i>, ""the fast of Esther.""
When the fast of Esther became a formal part of Jewish observance is a matter of question. It is not mentioned in the Talmud. Furthermore, <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i>, a text which mentions all the fasts and festivals observed in the Talmudic era, does not mention this fast and speaks of the thirteenth of Adar, the day on which the fast of Esther is observed, as a day of celebration, the Day of Nicanor, marking the defeat of the Greek general of that name in the Hasmonean wars. It was not until after the destruction of the Temple that the observance of the dates mentioned in <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i> was nullified. This would appear to indicate that the observance of the Fast of Esther was of later origin.
In contrast, there is evidence pointing to the establishment of the Fast of Esther early in the Talmudic period. The <i>Sheiltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon, <i>Parshat Vayakhel</i> 67, speak of the observance of the Fast of Esther in the time of the Mishnah. Even if this teaching is not accepted as historical fact, we can glean from it that in Rav Achai's time, shortly after the conclusion of the Talmud, the fast was already a long-standing custom.
Significantly, because of the difference in status between it and the other commemorative fasts, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 686:2) rules far more leniently in regard to this fast than in regard to the others.

Fasts 5.5,Ta'aniyot - Chapter 5,"And the entire Jewish people follow the custom of fasting at these times and on the Thirteenth of Adar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this phrase to mean that our obligation to fast on these days is a custom accepted by the Jewish people after the destruction of the Second Temple. As mentioned above, others interpret this obligation as stemming from the exegesis of the verse from Zechariah mentioned in the previous halachah, as found in <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 18b.
Our translation follows the standard published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. Many authoritative manuscripts make a small change in the wording, which would cause the lines to be rendered as: ""And in these times, the entire Jewish people follow the custom of fasting on the Thirteenth of Adar.""
</i>, in commemoration of the fasts that [the people] took upon themselves in the time of Haman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rabbis question precisely which fasts are being commemorated. Some maintain that since the Thirteenth of Adar was a day of battle on which the Jews waged war against their enemies, they fasted at that time to arouse Divine mercy (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). Others maintain that it is improper to fast in a time of war, lest this sap one's strength, and instead the Jews merely vowed to fast, but conducted the actual fasts at a later time.
A third opinion maintains that this refers to the three-day fast that Esther called before approaching Achashverosh. Although this fast was held in the month of Nisan, it is commemorated in connection with the Purim holiday.

Nor is it appropriate to hold this fast after Purim.

The fast of the Thirteenth of Adar is also referred to as <i>Ta'anit Esther</i>, ""the fast of Esther.""
When the fast of Esther became a formal part of Jewish observance is a matter of question. It is not mentioned in the Talmud. Furthermore, <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i>, a text which mentions all the fasts and festivals observed in the Talmudic era, does not mention this fast and speaks of the thirteenth of Adar, the day on which the fast of Esther is observed, as a day of celebration, the Day of Nicanor, marking the defeat of the Greek general of that name in the Hasmonean wars. It was not until after the destruction of the Temple that the observance of the dates mentioned in <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i> was nullified. This would appear to indicate that the observance of the Fast of Esther was of later origin.

Nevertheless, it is improper for a fast that is not scheduled for such a day to be held then, since this is not proper reverence for the Sabbath (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).

Fasts 5.19,Ta'aniyot - Chapter 5,"All these [commemorative] fasts will be nullified in the Messianic era<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With the conclusion of the exile, there will be no need to mark the dates that led to it with mourning and fasting. Thus the Rambam writes at the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Megillah</i>: ""All memories of the difficulties [endured by our people] will be nullified as [Isaiah 65:16] states: 'For the former difficulties will be forgotten.'
As mentioned previously, fasting is not an end in its own right, but a means to motivate the Jews to return to God and correct the faults in their behavior. The coming of the redemption will be a sign that the service of repentance is complete, and thus there will be no further need for fasting.

And they shall love truth and peace.'",into holidays and days of rejoicing and celebration," There is no possibility for the existence of an entity that is genuinely negative in nature. All those factors that appear negative represent hidden good, and furthermore, a good so powerful that the only way it can be revealed in this world is through qualities that outwardly appear negative. Their inner nature, however, is good, and in the era of the redemption when the world will be refined to the extent that it can accept this great good, this nature will be revealed.
