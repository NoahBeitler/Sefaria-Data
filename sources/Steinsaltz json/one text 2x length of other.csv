Song of Songs 1:6,"<b>Do not gaze at me </b>disrespectfully, seeing<b> that I am dark, for</b> this is not my natural color; rather, <b>the sun has tanned me.</b> The woman now addresses how a fair and modest daughter of Jerusalem faced such exposure to the sun:<b> The sons of my mother were incensed at me; they placed me as guard of the </b>family <b>vineyards,</b><b> </b>to chase away any animals that attempted to infiltrate.<b> </b>However,<b> </b>because of the task imposed upon me,<b> my own vineyard I did not guard. </b>I too have a vineyard of my own, but the members of my family who quarreled with me cared only for their vineyards, while mine was left abandoned. This verse can be understood as the personal struggle of a woman who wishes to extricate herself from the plight of her perceived external ugliness, and to reveal her hidden beauty. However, the verse can also be interpreted metaphorically as a declaration by the Jewish people: Admittedly we are not clean and pure as snow, but the blackness of our sins is not a natural blemish, nor was it caused by circumstances of our own choosing. As a nation, we have been forced to wander frequently. Because of the other nations, we were forced to fulfill various roles for the benefit of the world, to preserve their vineyards. Therefore, we were left without the time or opportunity to protect our own vineyard.<b>  </b>","Don’t stare at me because I am swarthy,<br>Because the sun has gazed upon me.<br>My mother’s sons quarreled with me,<br>They made me guard the vineyards;<br>My own vineyard I did not guard.<br>"

Ecclesiastes 7:9,"This verse also praises the virtue of patience, and it too refers to the human spirit: <b>Do not precipitate your spirit to become angry. </b>Do not allow yourself to be annoyed easily,<b> as anger abides in the bosom of fools. </b>Outbursts of rage can provide instant emotional gratification, but hasty, thoughtless expressions of anger are characteristic of fools.","Don’t let your spirit be quickly vexed, for vexation abides in the breasts of fools."
Ecclesiastes 7:10,"In contrast to the focus of the previous verses on the ultimate future, this verse addresses the past. <b>Do not say: How was it </b>in the past? And do not say <b>that the early days were better than these. For it is not from wisdom that you ask about this. </b>Do not cling to fond memories of the past, neither with regard to your personal life nor with regard to the broader historical context, as the days of yore were not actually better than present times. Some interpret this statement in accordance with its prevalent meaning that the world deteriorates over the course of the generations: It is unwise to express the pointless wish for a reprisal of the past. Either way, wistful, nostalgic remarks are unproductive; one should accept reality as it is.","Don’t say, “How has it happened that former times were better than these?” For it is not wise of you to ask that question."
Ecclesiastes 7:17,"Conversely, <b>do not be overly wicked,</b> even if you have already performed some evil,<b> and do not be foolish; why should you die before your time? </b>Evil and foolish people are more likely to die young.","Don’t overdo wickedness and don’t be a fool, or you may die before your time."
Ecclesiastes 10:20,"<b>Even in your thought do not curse a king</b>,<b> and </b>even when you are alone <b>in your bedrooms do not curse the rich, as a bird of the heavens will carry the voice, and a winged creature will tell a matter. </b>Any spoken words will eventually become public, as even if they are not spread by people, they will be disseminated by birds or other airy, imperceptible airborne mediums.
