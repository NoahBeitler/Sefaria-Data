Human Dispositions 1.1,De'ot - Chapter 1,"Each and every man possesses many character traits.

He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other.

This statement is difficult to comprehend since there appear to be many successful individuals who achieve their desires.

On the other hand, for the ""lover of money,"" money itself becomes his raison d'etre.</i>.""

Human Dispositions 1.2,De'ot - Chapter 1,"Between each trait and the [contrasting] trait at the other extreme, there are intermediate points, each distant from the other<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> understands this as follows: Let us imagine a line drawn from one extreme to another - between the stingy and the freehanded, for example. All who are neither stingy nor freehanded stand between them. They are all intermediate, whether they tend towards stinginess or freehandedness. Each point along this imaginary line stands apart - ""is distant"" - from the others on that line. In a diagram, this idea might be depicted as follows:<br/>
X-----*-------*------*-------*----------*---------*X<br/>
Stingy intermediate points freehanded.</p>
<p>However, it is highly unlikely that all the Rambam wishes to teach us is that there are many intermediate points of temperament between the extremes. After all, that is self-evident. Furthermore, in each set of associated temperaments - for example, stinginess and freehandedness - only three points on the line are of importance to the Rambam in clarifying his view of personality development: the two extremes and the midpoint. Why should he mention all the other intermediate possibilities?</p>
<p>Thus, it appears that the Rambam is telling us that there is a midpoint temperament between each pair of contrasting extremes. Given the entire range of human temperaments, there are a number of midpoints which are not necessarily related to each other. For example, the midpoint for generosity may be very different from the midpoint for humility. Thus, in Halachah 1, the Rambam stated that our personality traits are ""different and distant;"" in this halachah, he makes a parallel statement about the midpoints.</i>.<br>With regard to all the traits: a man has some from the beginning of his conception, in accordance with his bodily nature<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, we see an interrelation between body and soul. Certain temperaments are produced by or relate to particular physical characteristics.</p>
<p>[In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam states: ""From the outset of a person's [life], he has neither virtues nor vices...."" However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> and this halachah. The possession of certain character traits does not determine whether one will use them for a vice or a virtue.]</i>. Some are appropriate to a person's nature and will [therefore] be acquired more easily than other traits. Some traits he does not have from birth. He may have learned them from others<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam writes: ""From his youth, one becomes accustomed to acting in accordance with the accepted behavior of one's family and locale."" In these few words, the Rambam includes all the people who might influence a person's character development: his parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and others. Also, note Chapter 6, Halachah 1.</i>, or turned to them on his own. This may have come as a result of his own thoughts, or because he heard that this was a proper trait for him, which he ought to attain. [Therefore,] he accustomed himself to it until it became a part of himself.",a) This may have come as a result of his own thoughts," i.e., an intuitive realization of the correctness of a certain course of behavior stemming from one's own creative thought."

(See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.) He continues:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner. However, the difference between them is that the behavior of the pious is carefully calculated with the intent of refining his personality, while the underdeveloped person does so without thought, as a natural response to his whims and fancies.</i>.<br>What is implied?

Therefore, our Sages commanded: ""Be very, very humble of spirit.""</p>
<p>It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).

In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any ""general mitzvah"" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, ""Observe My statutes"" (Leviticus 19:19  or ""Be holy"" (Leviticus 19:2  are not included in the 613 mitzvot.

<p>As emphasized in the introduction to this text, the Rambam has structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intent of ""revealing all the laws to the great and to the small with regard to each and every mitzvah."" He does not mention philosophical and ethical concepts unless they are halachot - i.e., practical directives for our behavior.</p>
<p>In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God's ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve. Having laid down this foundation, he is able to define that mitzvah in this halachah and begin offering directives for its fulfillment in Halachah 7.</i>.""","A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought.

<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner.

<p>In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God's ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve.

<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner.

<p>It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).

In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any ""general mitzvah"" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, ""Observe My statutes"" (Leviticus 19:19  or ""Be holy"" (Leviticus 19:2  are not included in the 613 mitzvot.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.2,Avodat Kochavim - Chapter 3,"The gentiles established various different services for each particular idol and image.

Similarly, other services were instituted for other idols.<br>One who defecates before Marculis or throws a stone at Pe'or is free of liability until he serves it according to the accepted modes of service, as [implied by Deuteronomy 12:30]: ""[Lest one inquire about their gods, saying,] 'How did these nations serve their gods?

A person who does not worship an idol in the accepted mode of service is not liable (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, ibid.).</p>
<p>For this reason, a court must know the types of worship [practiced by gentiles] - Note Chapter 2, Halachah 2, which forbids the study of idolatrous practices. Apparently, license to do so is granted the sages to allow them to gain the knowledge mentioned in this halachah. (See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 68a.)"

When a person defecates before Pe'or to repudiate it, or throws a stone at Marculis to repudiate it -<i>Sanhedrin</i> 64a relates that one of the Sages of the Talmud actually made such an error and threw a rock at a shrine of Marculis, with the intent of destroying it.

""Out of love"" refers to a love for the image and its service, while ""out of fear"" means fear of what the deity can do to the person.</p>
<p>Rav Kapach explains the Rambam's position, justifying the need for such a difference in interpretation. Most idolaters do not worship their images out of a genuine conviction that they are the true god, but rather for the benefit they feel this service will bring them. Therefore, were a person to serve an idol with this intent in mind, the Rambam would hold him liable. In contrast, were he to serve out of fear, he is not considered to be acting on his own volition, and hence is not held responsible.</i> - or when one serves it out of his fear of it - i.e., he fears that it will harm him - as the [idol] worshipers fear [their deities as sources of] benefit and harm: If he accepts it as a god<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and serves it as an act of worship</i>, he is liable to be stoned to death.

Such acts are also ""service."" The offender is, nevertheless, not liable for lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah].<br>If one of the above services was the accepted mode of worship [of a particular deity] and a person performed this service as an act of worship, he is liable [for execution].","punished by lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah]"," The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that punishment is not given because this prohibition is a לאו שבכללות - i.e., it includes many different forbidden acts. Lashes are not given for the violation of such a prohibition, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3.</p>
<p>To explain: The prohibition, ""Do not serve them,"" is twofold in nature. It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.</p>
<p>Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes. Since, in essence, this prohibition is not associated with lashes, even the many transgressions of a lesser nature which are also included within this prohibition are also not punishable in this manner (Rav Kapach)."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.9,Avodat Kochavim - Chapter 3,"A person who has a false god made for himself - even though he, himself, did not actually fashion it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., he commissioned another person to make the idol for him.</i>, nor worship it - is [punished by] lashing, as [Exodus 20:5] states: ""Do not make for yourself an idol or any representation.""<br>Similarly, a person who actually fashions a false god for others, even for idolaters, is [punished by] lashing, as [Leviticus 19:4] states: ""Do not make molten gods for yourselves."" Accordingly, a person who actually fashions a false god for himself receives two measures of lashes.",is [liable for] lashes," The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions this statement, noting that lashes are not given for a transgression which does not involve a deed, and that speech is not ordinarily considered to be a deed. He explains that since the craftsman fashions the idol on behalf of the person who commissioned him, he is considered to be the latter's agent. Therefore, the one who commissioned him is held responsible for his deed.</p>
<p>The commentaries question this explanation, noting that - with the exception of a few specific instances - the Torah never holds a person who commissions another individual to commit a sin liable, since the person who actually committed the sin is responsible for his actions. Also, the Rambam's phraseology here implies that one is held liable regardless whether the craftsman is a Jew or gentile, and a gentile is never given the halachic status of an agent.</p>

<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam explains that any of the species which are stolen may not be used for the mitzvah, because a sin may not serve as the medium with which a mitzvah will be performed (מצוה הבאה בעבירה). (See also <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:7; <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach</i> 5:7, 5:9.)</p>

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 6,"When is the beginning of a haircut?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Halachah 5, the Rambam taught us that if one had already begun his involvement in any of these activities, he need not stop in order to recite <i>Minchah</i>. Therefore, it is necessary to understand what constitutes involvement in these activities.</i> When he puts the barber's cloth over his knees.<br>When is the beginning of a bath?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., when is he considered to be bathing, so that he need not stop to pray?</i> When he takes off his underclothes.<br>When is the beginning of [work in the] tanning house? When he ties the apron between his shoulders, as is the way of artisans<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 9b states simply: ""When he ties between his shoulders."" In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that it is when he ties his belt in order to work with the skins. Evidently this means the belt around his apron. There is a version of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah which mentions also that he begins working with the skins. This is, however, hard to understand in light of his commentary here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i>.<br>When is the beginning of eating? For those who live in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is when one washes his hands. For inhabitants of Babylonia, it is when they loosen their belts.<br>When is the beginning of judgment? When the judges robe themselves in their <i>taleisim</i> and sit down. If they were [already] sitting, it is when the adversaries begin to make their claims.","For the inhabitants of Babylonia, it is when they loosen their belts"," Rashi explains that the custom in Babylonia was to wear their belts particularly tight, necessitating that they be loosened prior to eating. This was not the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions only the halachah of washing one's hands. Since the Mishnah was written in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, its interpretation must be in line with the customs and realities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam focuses on the actual halachah. Hence, he defines the beginning of eating in line with both positions, one relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the other to Babylonia."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.8,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 6,"A person who is involved in the study of Torah when the time for prayer arrives must stop and pray<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) states that one must stop for <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but not for prayer. The Talmud (11a) explains that this refers to one involved in the study of Torah.</i>. If the study of Torah is his full-time occupation and he does not work at all, and he is involved in the study of Torah at the time of prayer, he need not stop, since the commandment of the study of Torah is greater that the commandment of prayer.<br>Anyone involved in efforts for the welfare of the community is like one involved in Torah study.","and he is involved in the study of Torah at the time of prayer, he need not stop, since the commandment of the study of Torah is greater than the commandment of prayer"," In <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:3, the Rambam states: ""There is no commandment among all the commandments that is equal to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah is equal to all the other commandments, since study brings one to action. Therefore, study comes before action at all times.""</p>
<p>A person involved in Torah study achieves a level of unity with God that is unparalleled by any other activity. One's intellect and God's wisdom become inextricably linked, until they are indistinguishable during the moments of one's actual involvement in study. On this basis, we can understand the description of Torah with the metaphor of bread (Proverbs 9:5, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13). After bread is consumed by a person, it becomes assimilated into his blood and becomes part of the person himself. Similarly, when Torah is studied, it becomes absorbed into the person's character and becomes an integral part of his being (<i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 5).</p>
<p>As explained in the introduction to this text, prayer focuses on our attempt to relate to the Godliness that permeates our worldly existence. Though this is an extremely significant service, the connection established through Torah study is more complete. Thus, <i>Shabbat</i> 10a records how Ravvah rebuked Rav Hamnuna for neglecting his Torah studies to prolong his prayers. By doing he was ""abandoning eternal life for transcient life."" Therefore, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues whose commitment to Torah was all encompassing were not required to interrupt their studies for prayer."

A sukkah that does not possess a roof is invalid<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because a dwelling even of a temporary nature must have a roof.</i>. To what does this refer? A sukkah whose walls are joined to each other like a hut; alternatively, when the side of the sukkah is placed against the wall<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Diagram B.</i>. However, if it has a roof, even only a handbreadth in width<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> between the two walls, as depicted in Diagram C. As long as it has a roof at least a handbreadth wide, the remainder of the roof may be slanted.</i>, or if one lifted the side of the sukkah close to the wall a handbreadth above the ground, it is kosher.

<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Manoach, and others explain that though leniency is taken and such a sukkah is allowed, it must still possess all the dimensions required of a kosher sukkah mentioned in Halachah 1 of this chapter. Accordingly, at least six handbreadths of the slanted roof must itself be kosher for use as <i>s'chach</i>, and it must be more than 16 handbreadths long, so that it will be of the required height. When the Sukkah meets these qualifications, one is permitted to eat and sleep within it. (See also Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 631:10.)"

<p>The basis for this departure can be explained in terms of two differences that exist between our contemporary circumstances and the situation which prevailed in Talmudic times:<br/>
a) During the Talmudic era, written texts were rare, and it was necessary for a student to commit all his subject matter to memory. Thus, the emphasis was on teaching students by rote.<br/>
b) Hebrew was a spoken language and, therefore, it was not necessary to spend time teaching the children the meaning of the subject matter.</p>
<p>At present, the major emphasis is on teaching learning skills and developing a student's powers of comprehension with the understanding that once one knows how to study, since the texts are easily available, he will be able to apply himself to the actual study at his convenience. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:6, 11; <i>Eglei Tal</i>, Introduction.)"
Torah Study 1.13,Talmud Torah - Chapter 1,"A woman who studies Torah will receive reward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for her efforts.</i>. However, that reward will not be [as great] as a man's, since she was not commanded [in this mitzvah]. Whoever performs a deed which he is not commanded to do, does not receive as great a reward as one who performs a mitzvah that he is commanded to do.<br>Even though she will receive a reward, the Sages commanded that a person should not teach his daughter Torah, because most women cannot concentrate their attention on study, and thus transform the words of Torah into idle matters because of their lack of understanding.<br>[Thus,] our Sages declared: ""Whoever teaches his daughter Torah is like one who teaches her tales and parables."" This applies to the Oral Law. [With regard to] the Written Law: at the outset, one should not teach one's daughter. However, if one teaches her, it is not considered as if she was taught idle things.","Chassidic thought explains the concept differently. The Hebrew word <i>mitzvah</i> (commandment) shares the same root as the word <i>tzavtah</i> (connection). Fulfilling the commandments establishes a transcendent bond with Godliness. In contrast, a good deed that is not commanded, no matter how worthy, remains an act of man and does not establish such a connection.",

<p>In the previous chapter, the Rambam listed five categories which are of absolute necessity for prayer. A person who fails to fulfill any of those requirements must repeat his prayers. These eight categories are לכתחילה (at the outset) necessary for the <i>Amidah</i>, but, do not disqualify the prayer if they were not tended to.</p>
<p>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> points out that even Chapter 4 refers to certain actions which were only problematic לכתחילה, such as burping and sneezing. Nevertheless, they are included in that chapter because, from a topical perspective, it is more appropriate to discuss them within the context of the general categories mentioned there."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.2,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 5,"Standing: What is implied?<br>[Generally,] one should pray only while standing.

<p>Indeed, the term <i>Amidah</i> - (lit. ""standing"") is used to refer to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> because of this requirement.

<p>From this discussion, we may conclude that, under these circumstances, it is acceptable for one to remain seated during the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> if doing so will contribute to one's ability to concentrate.</i>.<br>A person who is ill may pray even while lying on his side<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:2 which relates that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> lying on one's side, but not lying on one's back.</i>, provided he is able to have the proper intention.

[Therefore,] if he is able to concentrate properly he should pray. If not, he should not pray until he has eaten or drunk.<br>One riding an animal should not descend [from the animal] - even if he has someone to hold his animal. Rather, he should sit in his place and pray so his mind will be settled.","[Therefore,] if he is able to concentrate properly he should pray, and if not he should not pray until he has eaten or drunk"," It is questionable whether this halachah is accepted at present, when, after the fact, prayer with a lesser level of concentration is accepted (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 101) and <i>siddurim</i> are commonly available (See <i>ibid.</i> 9:3)."

Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side, and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>. A single tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together naturally.<br>Similarly, any knot which is not strong enough to hold when carried is not considered a knot [and the resulting bundle may be used as <i>s'chach</i>].","Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as s'chach.

Where does the above apply? In a small sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the commentary on both the previous and following halachot.</i>.

<p>The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 632:2) emphasizes that even where the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> is of this size, if the sukkah possesses seven cubits by seven cubits of kosher <i>s'chach</i> in one place, that portion may be considered to be a kosher sukkah and used during the holiday.</i>f there is] less than that, the sukkah is kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 632:1) states that one may eat and sleep throughout the entire sukkah. However, the Ra'avad and Rabbenu Nissim do not accept this leniency, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (632:3) advises following this stringency.</i>.<br>Where the substance that is unacceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is at the side, it disqualifies the sukkah if there are four cubits of it.

Sabbath 9.4,Shabbat - Chapter 9,"When one person brought fire, another brought wood<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's ruling is based on <i>Beitzah</i> 34a and the <i>Tosefta, Shabbat</i> 12:4.

<p>In resolution of this difficulty, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes his teacher, Rav Ya'akov bei Rav, who explains that the first clause describes a situation in which all the individuals performed their act virtually simultaneously, with a shared intent.

<p>If, by contrast, one put down the pot, another came - According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this is the key phrase in understanding the difference between the first clause and the second. ""Another came"" - i.e., he came after, and without any connection, to the first individual. Hence, the responsibility is not shared by the entire group. Accordingly, since the actions of the persons mentioned first could not bring about cooking in their own right, they are not held liable."

<p>In this context, it is worthy to refer to <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">I maintain that it is not proper for a person to stroll in the <i>Pardes</i> (study Torah's mystic secrets) unless he has filled his belly with bread and meat. ""Bread and meat"" refer to the knowledge of what is permitted and what is forbidden, and similar matters concerning other mitzvot. Even though the Sages referred to these as ""a small matter"" - since our Sages said: ""'A great matter,' this is <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah</i>. 'A small matter,' this is the debates of Abbaye and Ravva"" - nevertheless, it is fitting for them to be given precedence, because they settle a person's mind.</p>
<p>Thus, the Rambam teaches that a person should not embark on the study of deep spiritual questions until he has gained the intellectual maturity which comes from Torah study. Even after a person gains such maturity, there is no need for him to concern himself with the study of idol worship because there is no value which he can derive from such study."

They maintain that since, in the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, we liken ourselves to the angels and recite the same praises, a <i>minyan</i> is necessary. However, the other <i>Kedushot</i> are simply narrative descriptions of the praises uttered by the angels and therefore, do not require a <i>minyan</i>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, that halachah explains that if the sick person does not benefit from the forbidden substance in the normal manner, it may be used as a remedy even if there is no danger to life or limb. The Rambam gives the example of including chametz in a compress.</p>

The Sages explain (ibid., 32b) that it would have been appropriate to institute the shofar blowing in the morning service. However, the Romans desired to stamp out the performance of the mitzvot and sent guards to make sure that the mitzvah was not fulfilled. After midday, the guards left, and then, in the musaf service, the shofar would be sounded.</p>
<p>Originally, the Sages' decree involved determining the place of the service when the mitzvah required by the Torah would be fulfilled and this halachah must be interpreted in that context. However, as explained in Halachot 11 and 12, it became universally accepted Jewish custom to blow the shofar before the musaf prayers to fulfill the Torah's commandment, and thus ""confuse the Satan"" even before the beginning of our prayers, and then to sound the shofar again in the midst of those prayers to fulfill the Rabbinic decree.

Reading the Shema 3.11,Kri'at Shema - Chapter 3,"If feces are found in a hole in the ground<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Berachot</i> 25b.</i>, a person may stand with his shoe over the hole and recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, his shoe may not touch the feces<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> After stating the halachah that one may put one's shoe on top of the hole in the ground, <i>Berachot</i> 25b questions the law when excreta is stuck to a person's shoe, and leaves the question unresolved (תיקו). Accordingly, the more stringent opinion is followed.</p>
<p>The Rambam explains that this applies if there is any contact between the shoe and the feces. However, the Ra'avad maintains that this only applies when the feces are actually stuck to the shoe. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>.) 76:2 supports the Rambam's position.</i>.<br>If one finds very small feces, the size of a drop, he may expectorate thick saliva upon it to cover it, and then recite the <i>Shema</i>.<br>When there is a residue of feces on one's skin or one's hands are dirty from the washroom, if - because of the small quantity or its dryness - there is no foul odor, he may recite the <i>Shema</i>, since there is no foul odor.<br>However, if it is still in its place, even if not visible when he stands, since it is visible when he sits, he is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> until he cleans himself very well. This is because of the moist nature and foul smell of the feces.<br>Many <i>Geonim</i> taught that one is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> if one's hands are soiled, and it is proper to heed their teaching.","If there is a residue of feces on one's skin or one's hands are dirty from the washroom, if - because of the small quantity or its dryness - there is no foul odor"," <i>Berachot</i> 25a states simply “if there are feces on one's skin.” The Rambam explains this as referring to a residue of feces - i.e., a stain, with no actual substance.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Asher explains that this applies when there is actual substance on the person's skin, but it is covered by his clothing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 76:4 reflects the understanding of Rabbenu Asher. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> favors the Rambam's position."
Reading the Shema 3.18,Kri'at Shema - Chapter 3,"When two people are lying under one sheet<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> without clothing</i>, each is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> even if he has covered himself below his heart, unless the sheet also separates between them in a manner that prevents their bodies from touching<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 24a records a difference of opinion between Rav Yosef and Shmuel. Both agree (as the Rambam states later in this halachah) that when sleeping in the same bed with his wife, one need only turn his face away from her in order to recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, Shmuel is of the opinion that this same halachah applies even if he were sleeping with a person other than his wife, while Rav Yosef feels that this dispensation is only granted in regard to one's wife.</i> from the loins downward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in contrast, bodily contact above this point would not induce sexual thoughts.</p>
<p>The <i>Mishnah Berurah (Orach Chayim</i> 73:2) points out, regarding this halachah, that were one to separate himself from another with the sheet, he need not also turn his head away.</i>.<br>If he is sleeping with his wife, children or other young members of his household, their bodies are considered like his own, and he is not affected by them. Therefore, even though his body is touching theirs, he may turn away his face, separate below his heart and recite [the <i>Shema</i>].",their bodies are like his own and he is not affected by them," i.e., he is familiar with them and sexual thoughts are not likely to be aroused."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.9,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 2,"Before the first blessing of each and every Amidah-prayer, one states: ""God, open my lips, and my mouth will utter Your praise"" [Psalms 51:17]. Upon concluding the prayer, he says: ""May the utterances of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be in accordance with Your will, O God, my Rock and Redeemer"" [Psalms 19:15], and then steps backwards.","Before the first blessing of each and every prayer, one states: ""God, open my lips, and my mouth will utter Your praise"" [Psalms 51:17]"," See <i>Berachot</i> 4b which quotes Rabbi Yochanan as requiring this verse to be recited before every prayer.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Yonah explains that this verse must be understood in conjunction with the verse that follows it: ""You do not desire that I offer sacrifices; a burnt offering, You do not want:"" (Psalms 51:18 . After his relations with Bathsheva, King David realized that he could not attain forgiveness by offering a sacrifice, since a sacrifice is accepted only after an act done unwittingly. Therefore, he asked that God assist him in finding the proper means of expression through prayer to achieve atonement.</p>
<p>We, too, are in a similar situation for we have no Temple and our prayers were instituted in the place of our sacrifices. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 5.) Accordingly, we ask God to assist us in our desire to utter His praises, and request our needs in such a way that it will be desirable to Him.</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 4b raises a question regarding the recitation of this verse before <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Rabbi Yochanan himself states that one who starts the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> immediately after the blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, גאל ישראל (Who redeemed Israel) is called a person of the World to Come. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 18, where the Rambam mentions this halachah.)</p>

One does not make any special mention of remembrances in the first three or last three [blessings], except on the holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur themselves alone. And even on these days, they allowed it only with difficulty.</p>
<p>The """"remembrances"" referred to in the Mishnah are the very additions mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah.

<p>The difficulty regarding these additions stems from <i>Berachot</i> 34a which states that one may not add any special requests in the first three or last three blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. (See Chapter 6, Halachah 3.) However, Rabbi Yitzchak ibn Gayut explains that since these remembrances are relevant to the needs of the entire community, they may be recited in the first three and last three blessings. <i>Berachot</i> (ibid.) prohibits only requests made by an individual for his personal needs.</i>: ""Remember us for life,..."" and in the second one: ""Who is like You, Merciful Father<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Who is like You, Merciful Father, who remembers His creations for life with mercy.""

<p>As explained above, the opinions are not necessarily contradictory. Abraham's process of inquiry could have begun at age three, while at forty he gained greater understanding, and at forty eight, he achieved an even higher level of awareness.</p>
<p><i>Avot</i> 5:21 states: ""At forty, one achieves understanding."" By associating Abraham's apreciation of the Creator with this age, the Rambam implies that this awareness can come as a product of our own thought and meditation.</i>.

[There,] he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world and it is proper to serve Him. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country, until he came to the land of Canaan - proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: ""And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God.""<br>When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him.

Reading the Shema 1.3,Kri'at Shema - Chapter 1,"The commandment of <i>tzitzit</i> is not obligatory at night. N<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Numbers 15:39 states: ""And you shall see them..."" - implying that <i>tzitzit</i> must only be worn when they can be seen, i.e., daytime. Accordingly, there is no obligation to wear <i>tzitzit</i> at night. See <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:7-8.</i>evertheless, we recite [the section describing] it at night because it contains mention of the exodus from Egypt.<br>We are commanded to mention the exodus both during the day and at night as [Deuteronomy 16:3] states: ""In order that you shall remember the day of your leaving the land of Egypt all the days of your life.""<br>Reading these three sections in this order constitutes the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.",We are commanded to mention the exodus from Egypt both during the day and at night," See <i>Berachot</i> 12b.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam does not count the mentioning of the exodus from Egypt as one of the 613 commandments in the Torah, nor does he mention it elsewhere in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</p>
<p>The Rambam does, however, count the commandment of the telling of the story of the exodus on the fifteenth of <i>Nisan</i> - i.e., Passover night - as one of the mitzvot. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 21), and <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i>, Chapters 7 and 8.</p>
<p>According to some opinions, one can differentiate between the two obligations as follows: A person can fulfill his daily obligation with simply a thought about the exodus, whereas on <i>Pesach</i> night the mitzvah can be performed only through the verbal description of the redemption from Egypt. (See <i>Sha'agat Aryeh</i>, 13.)</p>
<p>This would explain the omission of this commandment from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. A commandment that can be fulfilled with a thought alone and not an explicit statement or action is not ""worthy"" of inclusion in the list of 613 commandments of the Torah. (See the Rambam's explanation of the commandment to remember Amalek: Positive Commandment 189).</p>
<p>The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, however, disagrees with this opinion. In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 67, he states that even the daily obligation requires an explicit statement. Nevertheless, he explains that it was not chosen as one of the 613 commandments because the obligation to remember the exodus twice daily is not stated in the form of a command in the Torah to ""Remember,"" but rather, as a reason for another mitzvah (the mitzvah of <i>matzah</i>): ""In order that you shall remember..."" (Deuteronomy 16:3 ."
Reading the Shema 1.4,Kri'at Shema - Chapter 1,"When reciting the <i>Shema</i>, after completing the first verse, one says quietly ""Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom forever."" H<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This phrase is recited quietly because it is not part of the section of the <i>Shema</i> as it appears in the Torah, but rather was recited by Jacob in Egypt, as explained later in this halachah.</p>
<p>It is, however, pronounced loudly on Yom Kippur. <i>Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer</i> explains that the angels praise God with this verse. On Yom Kippur, we are as pure as angels and thus, emulate their practice (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).</p>
<p>It is preferable to separate clearly between the end of ""Blessed be the name"" - i.e., the words לעולם ועד - forever, and the beginning of the next section, ואהבת (And you shall love...) (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 61).</i>e then continues to read the first section in its normal fashion: ""And you shall love God, your Lord...""<br>Why do we read it in this fashion? It is our tradition that when the patriarch, Jacob, gathered all his sons together in Egypt close to his death<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Genesis, Chapter 49.</i>, he commanded and urged them regarding the Unity of God and the path of God upon which Abraham and Isaac, his father, had tread.<br>He asked them: ""My sons, perhaps there are dregs among you, one who does not stand with me in the Unity of God?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> What would cause Jacob to have such a doubt regarding his children? One of the greatest merits of Jacob is that he - unlike Avraham, who fathered Yishmael, and Yitzchak, who had Esau as a son - had only righteous children.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains that Jacob desired to reveal the secret of the end of days to his children, but that this knowledge suddenly left him. He was worried that perhaps his sudden lack of understanding was due to the imperfect state of his children and therefore, felt compelled to ask them about their faith in the One God.</p>
<p>The Rambam omits all these particulars, since they are not relevant to the matter at hand - namely, the source of the custom of saying ""Blessed be the name..."" after ""<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...""</i>"" This is comparable to the manner in which Moses, our teacher, said to us: ""Lest there be among you a man or woman [whose heart turns this day from God...]"" (Deuteronomy 29:17 .<br>They all answered and said: ""Listen, Israel<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Jacob is also called by that name (Genesis 32:29 .</i>, God is our Lord, God is One,"" i.e., listen to us, Israel, our father, God is our Lord, God is One.<br>The wise elder responded:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Praising God for the fortune of having righteous children;</i> ""Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever.""

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.4,Tefilah and Birkat Kohanim - Chapter 8,"What is implied by [the term,] communal prayer? One [person] prays aloud and all [the others] listen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With this statement, the Rambam touches on a point debated both by the Sages of the Talmud and the later Rabbis. The mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 33b, states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Just as the leader of the congregation is obligated [to pray], each individual is obligated. Rabban Gamliel states: ""The leader of the congregation fulfills the obligation on behalf of the community.""</p>
<p>The Talmud (34b) elaborates on the difference of opinion:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">They asked Rabban Gamliel: ""According to your opinion, why does the community pray?""<br/>
He replied: ""In order to allow the leader of the community to prepare his prayers.""<br/>
Rabban Gamliel asked them: ""According to your opinion, why does the leader of the congregation pray aloud?""<br/>
They replied: ""In order to allow those who are not knowledgeable to fulfill their obligation.""<br/>
He told them: ""Just as he fulfills the obligation on behalf of those who are not knowledgeable, he fulfills it on behalf of those who are knowledgeable.""</p>
<p>The Sages of the Talmud continued to debate the issue. The ultimate decision accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, the Rambam (See Halachah 9), and Rabbenu Asher, is that during the entire year, the Sages' opinion is accepted. However, on Rosh HaShanah, because of the complexity of the blessings (See Halachah 10), Rabban Gamliel's opinion prevails.</p>
<p>Both Rabban Gamliel and the Sages agree that the practice of communal prayer involves two elements:<br/>
a) the silent prayers of many individuals; and<br/>
b) the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br/>
They differ, however, as to which of these elements is considered of primary importance. According to the Sages, the essential element of communal prayer is that ten or more people recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the same time. According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.</p>
<p>[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]</p>
<p>The Rambam's statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.</p>
<p>In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam's statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan's</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9). By doing so, one will have both the advantages of individual and communal prayer.</i>. This should not be done with fewer than ten adult<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Males who have reached the age of thirteen years and a day and manifested signs of physical maturity. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:19.)</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this halachah from <i>Berachot</i> 47b-48a which allows for the inclusion of a child in the <i>zimmun</i> for the grace after meals. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:7.) We assume that this leniency was granted only in regard to grace, but not in regard to prayer. See also <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 91:3.</p>
<p>Many Halachic authorities do not accept this conclusion. In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon rules that a child may be counted as the tenth in a <i>minyan</i>. Similarly, the <i>Ba'al HaMe'or</i> holds that even up to four minors may be counted in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted. There are opinions that in such a case, the minor must be at least six years old, understand that prayer is service to God, and hold a <i>chumash</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 55:5, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 55:5).</i> free males. The leader of the congregation is [counted as] one of them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though there is no explicit source to this effect, a number of midrashim (e.g., <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 23:4) lead to this conclusion.</p>
<p>One of the communal rites listed in <i>Megillah</i> 23b which requires a <i>minyan</i> is ברכת אבלים - the blessing one utters to those in mourning. For the recitation of that blessing, the presence of ten men other than the mourner himself is required. (See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 13:1.) Perhaps the Rambam feels that this statement is necessary to clearly distinguish between the different requirements of a <i>minyan</i> for prayer and ברכת אבלים.</i>.<br>Even if some of them have already prayed and fulfilled their obligation, they can complete the [quorum of] ten provided the majority of the ten have not prayed.<br>Similarly, we should not recite <i>Kedushah</i>, read the Torah with its blessings before and after it, or read the <i>haftorah</i> from the Prophets except in [a quorum of] ten.",provided the majority of the ten have not prayed. -<i>Soferim</i> 10:7 states:<br/>,"</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Our Sages in the West say [that <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>barchu</i> may be recited] even with seven. They explain their position [based on Judges 5:2]: ""In the time of tumult in Israel when the people volunteered themselves, blessed be God."" [The number of people correspond] to the number of words [in the verse which describes the blessing of God].<br/>
There are those who say only six [are required], since ברכו is the sixth word [of the above verse].</p>
<p>The Rambam differentiates between the ruling regarding prayer and his statements in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:8 where he writes that it is necessary that seven people out of ten eat bread in order to constitute a <i>minyan</i> for <i>zimmun</i>, for ""a noticeable majority"" is required.</p>
<p>There are two views quoted in the name of Rabbenu Tam (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> 23b); one, requiring a minimum of seven people who have not prayed for a <i>minyan</i> just as seven who have eaten bread are required for a <i>minyan</i> in regard to grace after meals and, another, requiring, only five. However, the Rambam's opinion is universally accepted as halachah.</p>
<p>Similarly, we should not recite Kedushah, - See Chapter 7, Halachah 17.</p>
<p>In the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is customary to recite three verses in the <i>Kedushah</i>:<br/>
a) ""Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the entire earth is full of His glory"" (Isaiah 6:3 ;<br/>
b) ""Blessed be the glory of God from His place"" (Ezekiel 3:12 ;<br/>
c) ""The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, throughout all generations"" (Psalms 146:10 .</p>
<p>Only the first two of these verses are recited in the <i>Kedushah</i> of the blessings before the <i>Shema</i>. However, in the<i>Kedushah</i> recited at the end of the service, a verse similar to Psalms 146:10 is also included.</p>
<p>The commentaries debate the definition of <i>Kedushah</i> and therefore, question which passage the Rambam requires to be omitted when one prays alone. The Rambam's statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, appear to define <i>Kedushah</i> as only the first of these three verses."
