Blessings 4.6,"When a person recites a blessing on bread, it also includes the appetizers eaten together with bread - e.g., cooked food or fruit. Reciting a blessing on these foods, however, does not include bread.<br>Reciting a blessing on cooked grains includes cooked food<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the cooked grains are considered ""sustaining food"" and have been granted a special blessing which includes (in synopsis) all the blessings of grace, reciting a blessing over them includes other cooked dishes eaten with them.</p>
<p>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> emphasizes that this applies to cooked foods that are eaten together with the grains. Otherwise, it would be difficult to understand how the blessing for the grains could cover foods that require other blessings. Note also the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, which offers an alternate explanation.</i>. Reciting a blessing on cooked food, however, does not include cooked grains."
Blessings 4.7,"A person who decides not to continue eating or drinking<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pesachim</i> 103b, which states that once a person diverts his attention from drinking wine, he must recite another blessing when he begins drinking again.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad notes that the passage from <i>Pesachim</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions only drinking and does not discuss eating, and on that basis protests against the Rambam's equation of the two. From <i>Berachot</i> 42a, however, it appears that similar principles apply with regard to eating.</i>, and afterwards changes his mind and [desires to] eat or drink, must recite another blessing although he has not changed his place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Halachot 3-5, a person who changes his place while eating must recite both a blessing after the food he has eaten previously and a blessing over the food he plans to eat in his new place.</p>
<p>Many authorities do not accept the Rambam's decision with regard to a meal that includes bread. When a person sits down to such a meal, he is considered to have fixed his attention on eating. People frequently become drawn into eating more than they originally intended at such meals. Thus, a person's decision not to continue eating is not considered final, since it is quite possible that he will change his mind and decide to eat again. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 179:1).</p>
<p>Based on these principles, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 179:1) rules that, although once a person has decided to cease eating or drinking a new blessing is generally required, when partaking of a meal it is not sufficient to make a mental decision, and a person must wash before grace to be considered to have ceased eating.</i>. If he did not decide [to cease] eating or drinking and had in mind to continue<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> eating at a later time</i> - even if he made an interruption for the entire day - he is not required to recite a second blessing."
Blessings 4.8,"When people who are sitting together<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> after having completed a meal</i> and drinking say ""Let us recite grace,"" or ""Let us recite <i>kiddush</i>,"" t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., they were eating on Friday afternoon or the afternoon before a festival. From sunset onward, it is forbidden to continue eating until one recites <i>kiddush</i>. It is, however, possible to recite <i>kiddush</i> early (see <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:11). Once the people agree to recite <i>kiddush</i>, they may no longer continue their meal (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>hey are forbidden to continue drinking until they recite grace or <i>kiddush</i>. S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 179:2 states that, according to the authorities who differ with the Rambam on the previous halachah, if one's desire to drink stems from having eaten, one may continue to drink at this point.</i>hould they desire to drink more - although they are not permitted to do so - before reciting grace or <i>kiddush</i>, they are required to recite the blessing <i>borey pri hagafen</i> before drinking.

Blessings 4.10,"A person should not recite a blessing over any food or drink until it is brought before him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:4) states that a person should hold the food in his right hand before reciting the blessing for it.</i>. If he recited a blessing, and then the food was brought before him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The blessing is considered to be in vain, and before partaking of the food,</i>, he must recite a second blessing.<br>When a person took food in his hand and recited a blessing, but [before he could eat it] it fell from his hand and was burned or washed away by a river<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or in any other way became inedible</i>, he should take other food and recite another blessing. [This applies] even when the food is of the same species<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:6) adds, ""and even if the other fruit was before him when he recited the blessing originally."" The Ramah (based on the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>) differs, and maintains that if he originally intended to partake of the other fruit as well, it is included in the first blessing and he should eat it without hesitation so that the blessing will not have to be repeated.</i>. He should also say, ""Blessed be the Name of Him whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever"" for the first blessing, so that he will not be considered to have recited a blessing in vain.<br>A person may stand over a stream of water, recite a blessing, and drink<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 6:1) mentions this instance as a contrast to the previous law.</i>. Although the water that was before him at the time he recited the blessing is not the water he drinks, this was his original intention."
Blessings 4.11,"Foods that are eaten within the meal, because of the meal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are quoted, with slight changes, from <i>Berachot</i> 41b. In his commentary on this passage, Rashi defines this first category of foods as relishes eaten with bread. He explains that other foods - e.g., cereals or vegetables - although they are eaten as part of a meal, require an independent blessing.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> differs, and maintains that any food that is eaten as part of a meal - e.g., the foods mentioned by Rashi, meat or fish - is included in this category. Even if they are not eaten with bread, merely at the same meal, they</i>, do not require a blessing beforehand or afterward. Rather, the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> that is recited in the beginning and the grace recited afterward include everything, because everything is secondary to the meal.<br>F<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This sentence explains the rationale for this ruling. These foods are not eaten casually during the day, but rather are eaten only as part of a meal, with the intent of satiating one's appetite. Accordingly, they are considered as secondary to bread, which is the primary element of the meal (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 177:1). Accordingly, we follow the ruling mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods.</p>
<p>This explanation appears to indicate that the Rambam follows<i>Tosafot's</i> interpretation. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 171:1) also rules accordingly. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:1, however, postulates that it is logical to assume that this ruling applies only when bread is eaten throughout the meal. If only a small amount of bread is eaten at the beginning of a meal, and no bread is eaten while the main course is being eaten, it is questionable whether the blessing over the bread covers these foods.</i>oods that are eaten within the meal, but do not come because of the meal, require a blessing before partaking of them, but do not require a blessing afterward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since they are eaten within the meal, they also satisfy a person's appetite. Accordingly, they are included in the blessing that is required by the commandment, ""When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless....""</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:1,3, based on Rabbenu Asher's commentary on <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions two instances when fruit is included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>:</p>
<p>a) When the fruits are eaten on bread itself,<br/>
b) When one eats a meal of fruit - i.e., the fruit is served to satiate one's appetite.</i>.<br>Foods that are eaten after the meal, whether because of the meal or independent of the meal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">fruits, desserts, or drinks</i>, require a blessing beforehand and afterward."

<p>It is forbidden to designate an animal as a sacrifice at present.

<p>On all other nights, we are not required to dip even once. On this night, we dip twice? — The first three of these four questions are recorded in the Mishnah.

The order mentioned by the Rambam is found in the Jerusalem Talmud and the codifications of Rabbenu Asher and Rav Yitzchak Alfasi.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the reason for this order is that the first three questions follow the pattern the child sees at the Seder: first we dip (<i>karpas</i>,) then we eat matzah, and then we eat maror.</p>

The blessing for the Paschal sacrifice does not free one of [the obligation of the blessing for] the [<i>Chaggigah</i>] offering. [C<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This follows the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Nevertheless, <i>Pesachim</i> 121a quotes Rabbi Yishmael, who offers an alternate opinion.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains these Sages' difference of opinion as follows: The blood of the Paschal sacrifice is to be poured out against the base of the Temple altar. In contrast, the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> should be sprinkled on the two opposite corners of the altar.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yishmael maintains that בדיעבד (after the fact), were a person to pour the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering on the base of the altar, he would be considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Hence, the blessing for the Pesach offering can apply to the <i>Chaggigah</i> as well.</p>
<p>In contrast, Rabbi Akiva maintains that even ""after the fact,"" the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is not acceptable if its blood is not sprinkled on the altar as prescribed. Accordingly, the blessing for the Pesach offering has no connection to the <i>Chaggigah</i> at all.</p>
<p>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's decision. In <i>Hilchot P'sulei HaMukdashim</i> 2:2, the Rambam writes: ""Whenever [blood] is prescribed to be presented [on the altar] by sprinkling, and it was presented by pouring, one has fulfilled his obligation,"" accepting the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. If so, his acceptance of Rabbi Akiva's opinion here appears to present a contradiction.</p>
<p>Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Tz'lach, Pesachim</i> ibid.) attempts to resolve the issue, explaining that the Rambam follows the interpretation of Rav Chayim HaCohen (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> ibid.), who favored a different text of the Talmud and, accordingly, an alternate interpretation of the difference in opinion between the two Sages.</p>
<p>Rav Chayim maintains that Rabbi Yishmael considers the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering as secondary to the Paschal sacrifice. (See also Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7.) Hence, reciting a blessing over the Paschal sacrifice, the essential element (עיקר) of the evening, also fulfills the requirement for the secondary element (טפל), the <i>Chaggigah</i>. Indeed, regarding the blessings recited over food, the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:5) that whenever there are two foods, one essential and one secondary, it is only necessary to recite a blessing over the essential food. A blessing is not required for the secondary item.</p>
<p>This interpretation itself presents a question: Since the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted only for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice and is not an obligation in its own right, it can be considered as ""secondary"" to the Pesach sacrifice. If so, what is the rationale for Rabbi Akiva's opinion?</p>
<p>It can be explained that Rabbi Akiva never considers one mitzvah as secondary to another. We may use the labels ""primary"" and ""secondary"" in regard to matters dependent on our will, but not in regard to mitzvot which we fulfill in obedience to God's desires. Therefore, though the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted because of the Paschal sacrifice, once it has been instituted, it must be considered as a mitzvah in its own right, with its own importance. Hence, it requires a unique blessing of its own (R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch Haggadah).</i>onversely, the blessing for the <i>Chaggigah</i>] offering does not free one of [the obligation of the blessing for] the Paschal sacrifice."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.10,"Afterwards, he washes his hands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> After eating a meal, we are required to wash with water, <i>mayim achronim</i>, before reciting grace (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:1).</i> and recites the grace after meals over a third cup [of wine] and drinks it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> after reciting the blessing, <i>borey pri hagefen</i>, as mentioned in Halachah 7:10.

However, the Rambam chooses the blessing which is customarily recited after Hallel.</p>
<p>This represents a change from the Rambam's statements in his commentary on the Mishnah, where he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""the blessing of song"" - this is ""<i>Nishmat kol chay</i>"" until its conclusion. ""May all Your works praise You, God..."" until its conclusion is also called the blessing of song. If one joins the two together, it is praiseworthy.</p>
<p>At present, we follow the custom of joining both blessings together.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as our Sages commented: ""Song is recited only over wine.""</i>, reciting upon it the blessing of song—i.e., ""May all Your works praise You, God..."" - recites the blessing, <i>borey pri hagefen</i>, [and drinks the wine]. Afterwards, he does not taste anything<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> neither food or drink. Note commentary on the previous halachah</i>, with the exception of water, throughout the entire night.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><br>It is permissible to mix a fifth cup and recite upon it ""the great Hallel<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From this statement, Rabbenu Manoach derives that otherwise drinking additional cups of wine is forbidden.</i>"" - i.e., from ""Give thanks to God, for He is good"" until ""By the rivers of Babylon."" This cup is not an obligation like the other cups<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Nissim writes that drinking a fifth cup fulfills the mitzvah in the most complete manner. However, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> quotes the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham, as relating that his father would always recite Psalm 136 after the Hallel prayers, and then conclude with the blessing without drinking a fifth cup. Accordingly, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> concludes that although it is permissible to drink a fifth cup, it is not proper to do so.</p>
<p><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXVII, suggests a different interpretation of this halachah, noting that the Rambam does not mention that the fifth cup is drunk. A fifth cup is mixed and placed on the table, and the ""great Hallel"" is recited over it. However, that cup should not be drunk. Thus, the fifth cup is not included as one of the four. Rather, it is a separate and independent obligation.</p>
<p>The Vilna Gaon (see <i>Ta'amei HaMinhagim</i> 551) associates the fifth cup with the cup of Elijah. The Talmud concludes the discussion of many unresolved questions with the statement: תיקו. Literally, the term is a shortened form of the word תיקום, ""let it remain"". However, it is also interpreted as an acrostic for the expression תשבי יתרץ קושיות ואביעות - ""The Tishbite (Elijah) will answer all questions and difficulties.""</p>
<p>Since the requirement of the fifth cup remains an unresolved question, the fifth cup is left for Elijah in the hope that he will come soon and resolve this question as well.</p>
<p>The homiletic aspects of this comment notwithstanding, from a halachic perspective a differentiation must be made between the two. The fifth cup is of Talmudic origin and may be poured for each individual. In contrast, Elijah's cup is an Ashkenazic custom of later origin, and a single cup is used for the whole family. Indeed, they are mentioned by halachists in different chapters of the Shulchan Aruch: the fifth cup by the Ramah in Chapter 481 and Elijah's cup by the <i>Chok Ya'akov</i> in Chapter 480.</i>.<br>One may complete the Hallel wherever one desires, even though it is not the place where one ate."

Significantly, the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and the <i>Noda BiYhudah</i> maintain that with this expression, the Rambam is implying that the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>, which is recited over other foods made from these species, also has its source in the Torah itself (See also <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 209).</i>, as [Deuteronomy 8:10] states: ""When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless God, your Lord.""<br>The Torah itself requires a person to recite grace only when he eats to the point of satiation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rabbis do not specify a standard quantity or measure of food that a person must eat to have reached this state.

The Sages, however, ordained<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">The angels complained to the Holy One, blessed be He: ""...In Your Torah, it is written [that You] 'will not show favor, nor take bribes,' and yet You show favor to the Jews....""<br/>
God replied: ""Are the Jews not worthy that I show them favor? In My Torah, I have written, ‘When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless,’ and they have nevertheless adopted the stringency of reciting grace after eating an amount equivalent to an olive.""</i> that one should recite grace after eating [an amount of bread equal] to the size of an olive."
Blessings 1.2,"Similarly, the Rabbis ordained<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The definition of this obligation as Rabbinical in nature has aroused questions. <i>Berachot</i> 35a states that this concept can be derived through one of the thirteen principles of Biblical interpretation. Thus, it has all the authority of a Torah law. Though the Rambam (see the Introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, General Principle 2) refers to laws derived in this manner as מדברי סופרים - literally, ""from the words of our Sages,"" the same term used here - his intent is not to imply that the law did not originate in the Torah itself.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot,</i> loc. cit.), however, explain that the Talmud ultimately does not accept the interpretation that the obligation is derived from the Torah, and maintain that the obligation to recite blessings is Rabbinic in origin. Even according to these opinions, it appears that the Sages ordained the recitation of blessings rather early in our national history. Midrashim referring to the age of King David explicitly mention the recitation of blessings, and there are intimations of this obligation in references to earlier periods. See also the commentary on Halachah 5.</i> that we recite blessings before partaking of any food. Even when one wants to eat the slightest amount of food or drink<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., less than a <i>k'zayit</i> or a <i>revi'it</i></i>, one should recite a blessing, and then derive benefit from it.<br>Similarly, when smelling a pleasant fragrance, one should recite a blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 9 with regard to the particular blessings required.</i> and then smell. Anyone who derives benefit [from this world] without reciting a blessing is considered as if he misappropriated a sacred article<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 35a explains that the entire world belongs to God, as Psalms 24:1 declares: ""The earth and its fullness are God's."" Although God allows man to benefit from this world, that license is granted only when man acknowledges God's control by reciting a blessing.</i>.<br>The Rabbis also ordained that one should recite a blessing after eating or drinking, provided one drinks a <i>revi'it</i> and eats a <i>k'zayit</i>. A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Anything less is not considered significant enough to require a blessing afterwards. A blessing beforehand must nevertheless be recited, because ""it is forbidden to benefit from this world without a blessing.""</p>
<p>There is, however, a law which appears to be an exception to this principle:</i> person who [merely] tastes food is not required to recite a blessing before partaking of it or afterwards unless he partakes of a <i>revi'it</i>."
Blessings 1.3,"Just as we recite blessings for benefit which we derive from the world<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained above,</i>, we should also recite blessings for each mitzvah before we fulfill it.<br>Similarly, the Sages instituted many blessings as expressions of praise and thanks to God and as a means of petition<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 10.</i>, so that we will always remember the Creator, even though we have not received any benefit or performed a mitzvah."
Blessings 1.5,"The text of all the blessings was ordained by Ezra and his court<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 33a explains that when the Men of the Great Assembly established the text of the prayer service (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 1:4), they also established the text for the various blessings and for <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdalah</i>.</p>
<p>This, however, does not mean that the blessings were not recited beforehand. Rather, just as explained with regard to prayer, before Ezra's time each person would recite the blessings according to his own inspiration and ability to express himself. In Ezra's time, many people had difficulty expressing themselves eloquently and, therefore, Ezra and his court established a standard text.</i>. It is not fit to alter it, to add to it, or to detract from it. Whoever alters the text of a blessing from that ordained by the Sages is making an error<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Radbaz (Vol. 5, Responsum 1424) states that as long as the person mentions God's name, His sovereignty over the world, and the subject of the blessing, he fulfills his obligation even if he does not use the text ordained by the Sages. (This interpretation is borne out by the next halachah.)</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's phraseology alludes to two types of changes:<br/>
a) Changes which do not substantially alter the blessing from the text ordained by the Sages. With regard to such changes, the Rambam uses the expression ""it is not fit,"" which implies that although the person's deed is not desirable, he fulfills his obligation.<br/>
b) A change of an innovative nature which alters the text of the blessing entirely. These changes the Rambam considers as ""errors"" which prevent a person from fulfilling his obligation. See also Halachah 13, <i>Berachot</i> 40b, and <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:7.</i>.<br>A blessing that does not include the mention of God's name and His sovereignty [over the world]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the phrase מלך העולם (King of the universe),</i> is not considered a blessing unless it is recited in proximity to a blessing [which meets these criteria]."
Blessings 1.6,"All the blessings may be recited in any language<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although the text ordained by Ezra and his court was in Hebrew, there is no absolute requirement to use that language</i>, provided one recites [a translation of] the text ordained by the Sages. [A person who] changes that text<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> reciting a different blessing from that ordained by the Sages</i> fulfills his obligation nonetheless - since he mentioned God's name, His sovereignty, and the subject of the blessing - although he did so in a ordinary language."
Blessings 1.7,"A person should recite all the blessings loud enough for him to hear what he is saying. Nevertheless, a person who does not recite a blessing out loud fulfills his obligation, whether he verbalizes the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> pronouncing the words with his lips</i> or merely recites it in his heart."
Blessings 1.8,"Whenever one recites a blessing, one should not make an interruption between the blessing and the subject for which the blessing is recited<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This applies with regard to both blessings recited before food and blessings recited before performing a mitzvah.</i>. If one makes an interruption with other matters, one must recite the blessing again.<br>If, however, one makes an interruption which relates to the subject of the blessing, one does not have to repeat the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's phraseology appears to indicate that, at the outset, one should not make any interruption. If, however, the situation demands that an interruption be made or if one inadvertently does so, the blessing need not be repeated when it is of the following nature.</i>. What is implied? When a person recites a blessing over bread and before eating says, ""Bring salt,"" ""Bring food,"" ""Give so-and-so to eat,"" ""Bring food for the animal,"" or the like, he need not repeat the blessing."
Blessings 1.9,"A person who is ritually impure is permitted to recite all the blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 4:8, the Rambam states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">The words of Torah never contract impurity. Rather, they remain pure forever, as [Jeremiah 23:29] states: ""Are not My words as fire...."" Just as fire can never contract impurity, the words of Torah never contract impurity.</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4, the Rambam applies these same principles to the words of prayer.</i>. This applies regardless of whether the impurity is of a type from which one can purify oneself on the same day or not<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are some impurities - e.g., the impurity of a זב or the impurity resulting from contact with a human corpse - which require an extended period of time and other rituals besides immersion to regain ritual purity. (See also <i>Berachot</i> 3:4-6 and the Rambam's commentary on those <i>Mishnayot</i>.)</i>.<br>A person who is naked should not recite a blessing until he covers his genitals. To whom does this apply? To men<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> whose genitals protrude. In contrast,</i>. Women may recite blessings [while naked], provided they sit with their genitals facing the ground."
Blessings 1.10,"[The following principle applies to] all blessings: Although a person has already recited them and fulfilled his own obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the same principle applies when the person reciting the blessing has not fulfilled his obligation, but does not desire to do so at the present time.</i>, he may recite them again for others<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since, in this instance, the only way the mitzvah can be fulfilled is by eating the food.</p>
<p>Note the <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 273, which states that, at the outset, a person who has already recited <i>kiddush</i> should not recite <i>kiddush</i> for others, unless they are incapable of doing so themselves.</i> who have not fulfilled their obligation, so that they can fulfill their obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam describes the manner in which the listener fulfills his obligation in the next halachah.</p>
<p>For the above principle to apply, however, the listener must be obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. When the listener is not obligated - e.g., a woman for shofar blowing - a person should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated himself (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 589:6).</i>.<br>There is, however, one exception: blessings over benefit which is not associated with a mitzvah. In this instance, one may not recite a blessing for others unless one enjoys benefit together with them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this instance, there is no obligation for a person to partake of this food. Hence, the principle of ערבות does not apply (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) unless the person reciting the blessing also desires to partake of the food. Should he desire to do so, the blessing he recites may include others as well. (Note an alternate explanation in the commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 16.)</i>. Nevertheless, one may recite blessings for benefit which is associated with a mitzvah - e.g., eating matzah on Pesach and reciting <i>kiddush</i> [on Sabbaths and festivals] - for others. They may then eat or drink, even though the one [who recites the blessing] does not eat or drink with them."
Blessings 1.11,"Whenever a person listens to the entire recitation of a blessing with the intention of fulfilling his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:3) rules that the person reciting the blessing also must intend that the listener fulfill his obligation by hearing the blessing.</p>
<p>The <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> 213 explain that this ruling points to a question of a larger scope: Do mitzvot of the Rabbis require intention, or is it possible to fulfill one's obligation by performing the required act without any intent.</p>
<p>According to the latter view, although the person reciting the blessing does not have the intention of fulfilling the obligation of the listener, since ""one who listens is considered as though he responded,"" the listener is considered to have recited the blessing, and thus to have fulfilled his obligation.</p>
<p>In contrast, the former view requires that one have a conscious desire to fulfill one's obligation when fulfilling a Rabbinic obligation. Since the person reciting the blessing did not have such an intention on behalf of the listener, the listener cannot fulfill his obligation.</i>, he is considered to have fulfilled his obligation although he does not answer <i>Amen</i>. Whoever answers <i>Amen</i> to a blessing recited by another person is considered as if he recited the blessing himself, p<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 53b mentions two opinions, one which equates the person answering<i>Amen</i> with the person actually reciting the blessing (the opinion cited by the Rambam), and one which considers the person answering to be on an even higher level.</p>
<p>Thus, with this statement, the Rambam is explaining that, although a person can fulfill his obligation by listening without answering <i>Amen</i>, when he answers he is considered as if he actually recited the blessing himself (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>rovided the person who recites the blessing is obligated to recite that blessing.<br>If the person who recites the blessing is obligated only because of a Rabbinic ordinance<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., an adult male who has not eaten to the point of satiation</i>, while the person responding is obligated by Torah law, the listener cannot fulfill his obligation until he repeats<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> word for word</i> in response [to the one reciting the blessings] or until he hears [the blessing recited] by someone who, like him, is obligated by Torah law."
Blessings 1.12,"When many people gather together to eat [a meal with] bread or to drink wine, and one recites the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation follows the standard text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. According to the source for this law, <i>Berachot</i> 6:6, and the manner it is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:11), it should read, ""one person should recite the blessing."" This is the preferred manner for the group to bless their food, because ""within the multitude of people is the glory of the king"" (Proverbs 14:28 .</p>
<p><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 167:18 relates that today, even when eating a meal as a group, it is customary for each person to recite the blessing over bread himself, so that an interruption is not made between the recitation of the blessing and partaking of the food.</i> while the others respond <i>Amen</i>, they are [all] permitted to eat and drink.

<p>This reflects the position of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13). The <i>Magen Avraham</i>, however, differs, and maintains that one cannot fulfill his obligation to recite blessings that involve benefit unless one had the intention of eating together with the other person and responding to his blessings. This view takes a more lenient position regarding blessings over mitzvot, which we are obligated to fulfill, than regarding the blessings over food, which we are not obligated to eat.</i>.<br>When does the above apply? With regard to bread and wine. With regard to other foods, however, which do not require [premeditated intent] to be eaten together as a group, if one person recited a blessing and everyone answered <i>Amen</i>, they may eat and drink although they did not intend to gather together as a group."
Blessings 1.13,"Whenever a person hears a Jew recite a blessing, he is obligated<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This represents a difference of opinion between the Rambam and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 215), who considers responding<i>Amen</i> a matter left to our own volition. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 215:2) quotes the Rambam's opinion. Furthermore, the <i>Magen Avrahamh</i> 6:9 mentions an obligation to recite<i>Amen</i> ninety times each day.</i> to respond <i>Amen</i>, although<br/>

When a child recites a blessing with the intent of fulfilling his obligation, however, it is appropriate to respond <i>Amen</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 215:3).</i>, or an adult who altered the text of the blessing."
Blessings 1.14,"Whenever responding <i>Amen</i>, one should not recite a rushed <i>Amen</i>, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation is based on the interpretation of the <i>Aruch</i>, which explains that this means that a person should not answer <i>Amen</i> before the one reciting the blessing has concluded its recitation.</p>
<p>Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 47a) interprets this to mean that one substitutes a <i>chataf patach</i> (:-) for a <i>kamatz</i> in the vocalization of the <i>Alef</i>.

Blessings 1.15,"Whoever recites a blessing for which he is not obligated is considered as if he took God's name in vain<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 12:9-10, where the Rambam states that a person who intentionally recites a blessing in vain should be placed under a ban of ostracism.</p>
<p>Note Chapter 4, Halachah 10, which states that after reciting an unnecessary blessing, one should praise God, saying, ""Blessed be the Name of Him whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever"" so that his mention of God's name will not be in vain.</i>.

Even though in this manner, they recite blessings in vain in the midst of their study, it is permissible. One should not recite <i>Amen</i> after their blessings. A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The source of this halachah, <i>Berachot</i> 53b, indicates that this law applies only when the children are reciting the blessings for practice. When they are reciting the blessings to fulfill their obligation, we should respond <i>Amen</i>.</i> person who answers <i>Amen</i> after their blessings does not fulfill his obligation."
Blessings 1.16,"It is demeaning for a person to recite <i>Amen</i> after his own blessings. W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This does not refer to the recitation of a single blessing (which is discussed in Halachah 18), but the recitation of<i>Amen</i> after each blessing recited in a series of blessings. Reciting <i>Amen</i> is considered demeaning because it implies a conclusion of one's prayers. It is not proper to conclude and begin, conclude and begin, several times in one series (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>hen, however, one concludes the last of a series of blessings, it is praiseworthy to answer <i>Amen</i> - e.g., after the blessing, <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i> in grace, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The third blessing in grace. Note also the following halachah. This example is explicitly mentioned by <i>Berachot</i> 45b, the source for this halachah.</i>nd after the final blessing [following] the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> in the evening service. Similarly, always, at the conclusion of the last of a series of blessings, one should recite <i>Amen</i> after one's own blessing."
Blessings 1.17,"Why is <i>Amen</i> recited after the blessing <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i>, although it is followed by the blessing <i>Hatov v'hametiv</i>? B<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> On the surface, the latter blessing, and not the blessing <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i>, marks the conclusion of the blessings of grace.</i>ecause the latter blessing was ordained in the era of the <i>Mishnah</i> and is considered to be an addition. The conclusion of the essential blessings of grace is <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i>.<br>W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Hence <i>Amen</i> is recited at this point. As mentioned in the commentary on the previous halachah, its recitation differentiates between the blessings required by the Torah and those instituted by the Rabbis.</i>hy is <i>Amen</i> not recited after the blessing <i>Ahavat olam</i>? Because it is the conclusion of the blessings recited before the <i>Shema</i>. S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and an interruption should not be made between these blessings and the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.</i>imilarly, in other instances when [a series of] blessings are recited before a practice - e.g., the blessings recited before the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> or the kindling of the Chanukah lights - <i>Amen</i> [is not recited] lest it constitute an interruption between the blessings and [the fulfillment of] the performance over which they are being recited."
Blessings 1.18,"Why is <i>Amen</i> not recited after the blessing over fruits and the like? B<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that the Rambam is not referring to the blessing recited before partaking of fruit. All agree that one should not recite <i>Amen</i> after such a blessing, because <i>Amen</i> would constitute an interruption between the blessing and partaking of the fruit. Rather, the Rambam is speaking about the blessing <i>al hapairot</i> or other similar blessings.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam on this matter and suggests that a person should recite <i>Amen</i> after concluding any of these blessings. The later authorities, however, accept the Rambam's decision.</i>ecause it is only a single blessing, and <i>Amen</i> is recited only after a concluding blessing that follows another blessing or blessings - e.g., the blessings of the king or the blessings of the High Priest<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The series of eight blessings recited by the High Priest after reading from the Torah during the Temple service on Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 3:11).</i> - to signify the conclusion of the blessings. Therefore, reciting <i>Amen</i> is appropriate."
Blessings 1.19,"When a person eats a forbidden food - whether consciously or inadvertently - he should not recite a blessing beforehand or afterward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is improper to bless God after transgressing His commandments. On the contrary, concerning a similar incident, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 1:5) cites Psalms 10:3, ""A thief who recites a blessing disgusts God."" Even an inadvertent violation of the law is an act against His will for which it is not appropriate to bless Him.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad and Rabbenu Asher differ with the Rambam's decision and maintain that the fact that a person violates a commandment against eating forbidden food should not cause him to violate another commandment and benefit from the world without praising God. The<i>Turei Zahav</i> 196:1 attempts to resolve the two views and offers a compromise: A person who intentionally violates a prohibition should not recite a blessing. If, however, a person eats a forbidden food inadvertently, he should recite a blessing afterwards.</p>
<p>Significantly, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 196) explains that even the Rambam would agree that a sick person who is required to eat a forbidden food for medicinal purposes should recite a blessing. There are, however, authorities who differ with this ruling as well.</i>.<br/>
What is implied? If one eats <i>tevel</i> - even food that is classified as <i>tevel</i> by Rabbinical decree, t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., produce that grows in containers. According to Torah law, the agricultural gifts are required to be given only from produce that grows in the earth itself (Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Berachot</i> 7:1).</i>he first tithe from which <i>terumah</i> was not separated, or the second tithe<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which must be eaten in Jerusalem. If this is not possible, the food can be redeemed and the money brought to Jerusalem to purchase food there. It is forbidden to eat this food outside Jerusalem until it is redeemed (Deuteronomy 14:22-27). In this instance, we are speaking about a situation where the redemption was improperly performed - e.g., one used uncoined metal (the Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Berachot</i> 7:1).</i> or sanctified foods that were not redeemed in the proper manner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> They were redeemed using landed property, which is unacceptable (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i>, one should not recite a blessing. Needless to say, this applies if one ate meat from an animal that was not ritually slaughtered or was <i>trefah</i> o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> An animal attacked by a wild beast or diseased and therefore suffering from an affliction that will cause it to die within twelve months (<i>Hilchot Shechitah</i>, Chapter 5).</i>r if one drank wine used as a libation for idol worship."
Human Dispositions 1.1,"Each and every man possesses many character traits. Each trait is very different and distant from the others<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Many commentaries assume that the Rambam is stating simply that there are many personality types, which he proceeds to describe: e.g., the angry man, the calm man, etc. They quote various sources in support of this viewpoint, among them <i>Berachot</i> 58a: ""Whoever sees a multitude of Jews recites the blessing: 'Blessed is...the wise who knows the hidden secrets,' because just as their natures are not similar, neither are their faces.""</p>
<p>However, by stating that the many character traits are possessed by ""each and every man,"" it is possible that Rambam is implying more than that there are people with different traits. Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other. Anger, generosity, and modesty, for example, can be found together in the same person, much in the same way that tenants of all sorts - unrelated to each other - can be housed in a common building.</p>
<p>To illustrate these traits, the Rambam employs concrete examples of extreme personalities, so that the contrasts can be appreciated more easily.</i>.<br>One type of man is wrathful; he is constantly angry. [In contrast,] there is the calm individual who is never moved to anger, or, if at all, he will be slightly angry, [perhaps once] during a period of several years.<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>here is the prideful man and the one who is exceptionally humble. There is the man ruled by his appetites - he will never be satisfied from pursuing his desires, and [conversely,] the very pure of heart, who does not desire even the little that the body needs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This pair of contrasting personality types deal with a person's appetites which can be satisfied by sensual experience. For example, gluttony is stimulated and satisfied by taste. In contrast, the traits mentioned below - the desire for money or the lack of desire for it - do not involve the senses.</i>.<br>There is the greedy man, who cannot be satisfied with all the money in the world, as [Ecclesiastes 5:9] states: ""A lover of money never has his fill of money<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, the Rambam describes an example where the desire for money becomes a goal in itself. In contrast, a man who gathers money so that he can buy things or achieve power is not interested in money per se. Although he may be faulted for different reasons, he is not greedy for money. On the other hand, for the ""lover of money,"" money itself becomes his raison d'etre.</i>."" [In contrast,] there is the man who puts a check on himself; he is satisfied with even a little, which is not enough for his needs, and he does not bother to pursue and attain what he lacks<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This refers to a lazy person, who will not bestir himself even for that which is necessary. In Chapter 2, Halachah 7, this type is described clearly as: ""lazy and an idler."" This is the description, too, in the Rambam's Introduction to <i>Avot - Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.</i>.<br>There is [the miser,] who torments himself with hunger, gathering [his possessions] close to himself. Whenever he spends a penny of his own, he does so with great pain. [Conversely,] there is [the spendthrift,] who consciously wastes his entire fortune.<br>All other traits follow the same pattern [of contrast]. For example: the overly elated and the depressed; the stingy and the freehanded<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation of <i>shua</i> is clearly evident from <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 7:11. It follows that <i>chili</i> represents the opposite extreme. (See also Ibn Ezra, Isaiah 32:5.)</p>
<p>The difference between this pair of traits and the miser-spendthrift pair mentioned above is that the latter refers to a person's conduct toward himself, while the former refers to his conduct with regard to others. The stingy man, unlike the miser, may spend money for his own needs, but is tightfisted when others are concerned. By the same token, a freehanded man need not necessarily indulge himself, though he is generous when giving charity. Though this may sound praiseworthy, when taken to extremes it can also prove dangerous, because a person may hurt himself in the process of giving excessively to another. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)</i>; the cruel and the softhearted; the coward and the rash. and the like."
Human Dispositions 1.2,"Between each trait and the [contrasting] trait at the other extreme, there are intermediate points, each distant from the other<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> understands this as follows: Let us imagine a line drawn from one extreme to another - between the stingy and the freehanded, for example. All who are neither stingy nor freehanded stand between them. They are all intermediate, whether they tend towards stinginess or freehandedness. Each point along this imaginary line stands apart - ""is distant"" - from the others on that line. In a diagram, this idea might be depicted as follows:<br/>
X-----*-------*------*-------*----------*---------*X<br/>
Stingy intermediate points freehanded.</p>
<p>However, it is highly unlikely that all the Rambam wishes to teach us is that there are many intermediate points of temperament between the extremes. After all, that is self-evident. Furthermore, in each set of associated temperaments - for example, stinginess and freehandedness - only three points on the line are of importance to the Rambam in clarifying his view of personality development: the two extremes and the midpoint. Why should he mention all the other intermediate possibilities?</p>
<p>Thus, it appears that the Rambam is telling us that there is a midpoint temperament between each pair of contrasting extremes. Given the entire range of human temperaments, there are a number of midpoints which are not necessarily related to each other. For example, the midpoint for generosity may be very different from the midpoint for humility. Thus, in Halachah 1, the Rambam stated that our personality traits are ""different and distant;"" in this halachah, he makes a parallel statement about the midpoints.</i>.<br>With regard to all the traits: a man has some from the beginning of his conception, in accordance with his bodily nature<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, we see an interrelation between body and soul. Certain temperaments are produced by or relate to particular physical characteristics.</p>
<p>[In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam states: ""From the outset of a person's [life], he has neither virtues nor vices...."" However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> and this halachah. The possession of certain character traits does not determine whether one will use them for a vice or a virtue.]</i>. Some are appropriate to a person's nature and will [therefore] be acquired more easily than other traits. Some traits he does not have from birth. He may have learned them from others<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., an intuitive realization of the correctness of a certain course of behavior stemming from one's own creative thought.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam writes: ""From his youth, one becomes accustomed to acting in accordance with the accepted behavior of one's family and locale."" In these few words, the Rambam includes all the people who might influence a person's character development: his parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and others. Also, note Chapter 6, Halachah 1.</i>, or turned to them on his own. This may have come as a result of his own thoughts, or because he heard that this was a proper trait for him, which he ought to attain. [Therefore,] he accustomed himself to it until it became a part of himself."
Human Dispositions 1.3,"The two extremes of each trait, which are at a distance from one another, do not reflect a proper path<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the path described in this and the following halachot.</i>. It is not fitting that a man should behave in accordance with these extremes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> if that his nature</i> or teach them to himself.<br>If he finds that his nature leans towards one of the extremes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., a genetic trait, as mentioned in the previous halachah</i> or adapts itself easily to it, or, if he has learned one of the extremes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the third type of trait mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> and acts accordingly, he should bring himself back to what is proper and walk in the path of the good [men]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the path that good men follow. This translation is based on the fact that the word ""path"" is in the singular, while the modifier ""good"" is in the plural.</i>. This is the straight path."
Human Dispositions 1.4,"The straight path<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This expression is also used in <i>Avot</i> 2:1. In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam cites his explanation of the middle path in the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>.</i>: This [involves discovering] the midpoint temperament of each and every trait that man possesses [within his personality.] This refers to the trait which is equidistant from either of the extremes, without being close to either of them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These statements echo the opening remarks of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">The good acts are those balanced ones midway between two extremes. Both of the extremes are bad - one reflects excess and the other, want. The virtues [good traits] are temperaments and habits which are midway between these two bad tendencies.<br/>
These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits.</p>
<p>Despite the similarity between the Rambam's statements here and those quoted, there is a slight difference. Here, the Rambam focuses on good traits, while in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, he emphasizes good actions.</i>.<br>Therefore, the early Sages instructed a man to evaluate his traits, to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At the conclusion of Chapter 4 of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">When a man weighs his actions constantly and directs them towards their midpoints, he will be on the most elevated human plane possible. He will thereby approach God and grasp His will. This is the most perfect path in the service of God.</p>
<p>Constant introspection is a necessary element in any program of personal and spiritual growth. Even when a person has the highest goals, unless he frequently looks himself squarely in the mirror and examines his behavior, he may make gross errors.</i>, so that he will be sound {of body}.<br>For example: he should not be wrathful, easily angered; nor be like the dead, without feeling, rather he should [adopt] an intermediate course; i.e., he should display anger<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation is based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3. (Note also the commentary of the <i>Knesset HaGedolah</i>.)</i> only when the matter is serious enough to warrant it, in order to prevent the matter from recurring. S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>imilarly, he should not desire anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [Proverbs 13:25] states<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the ""intermediate traits;"" perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.</p>
<p>However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. Deuteronomy 8:10 teaches: ""You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord."" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.</p>
<p>Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess. This is a dominant theme in the sections on diet in Chapter 4, and those describing the conduct of a Torah sage in Chapter 5.</i>: ""The righteous man eats to satisfy his soul.""<br>Also, he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [Psalms 37:16] states:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions.</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note Proverbs 6:6: ""Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;"" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: ""If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good"" (Psalms 128:2 .<br/>
""You are fortunate"" - in this life, and ""will possess the good"" - in the world to come.</p>
<p>The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11. Thus, the Rambam is not criticizing a person for working hard, but rather teaching us that work and its profits should not be our greatest priorities.</i> ""A little is good for the righteous man.""<br>He should not be overly stingy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The printed editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> have <i>yikfotz</i> (close his hand). However, most manuscripts use the term: <i>yikabetz</i> (gather).</p>
<p><i>Yikfotz</i> recalls Deuteronomy 15:7: ""Do not close your hand from your needy brother."" Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift. The variant texts might reflect a difference of opinion as to which opposing extremes the Rambam had in mind.</i> nor spread his money about, but he should give charity according to his capacity and lend to the needy as is fitting<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Lending is also a form of charity. In <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 10:7, the Rambam lists eight degrees of charity. The highest is the support of a fellow Jew who has become poor by giving him loans or the like.</i>. He should not be overly elated and laugh [excessively], nor be sad and depressed in spirit. Rather, he should be quietly happy at all times<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> his joy should be a composed sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>[In this context, see the Ramah's conclusion of his notes to <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (697:1) in which he quotes Proverbs 15:15: ""A good-hearted person is always celebrating.""]</i>, with a friendly countenance. The same applies with regard to his other traits<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam mentions many other ""intermediate traits."" Among them:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Courage is the midpoint between arrogance and fear. Humility is the intermediate between pride and meekness. Earnestness is the intermediate between boasting and lowliness....Patience is the intermediate between rashness and insensitivity...</i>.<br>This path is the path of the wise. Every man whose traits are intermediate and equally balanced can be called a ""wise man."""
Human Dispositions 1.5,"A person who carefully [examines] his [behavior]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in an effort to achieve the desired intermediate path</i>, and therefore deviates slightly from the mean to either side is called pious<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam explains that one can refine and correct his behavior by balancing a tendency for excess in one direction by intentionally forcing oneself to adopt the opposite extreme. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.) He continues:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.</p>
<p>He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner. However, the difference between them is that the behavior of the pious is carefully calculated with the intent of refining his personality, while the underdeveloped person does so without thought, as a natural response to his whims and fancies.</i>.<br>What is implied? One who shuns pride<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At first glance, the choice of pride as an example is rather problematic, because in Chapter 2, Halachah 3, the Rambam states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">There are traits for which it is forbidden for a person to follow an intermediate path.... Such a trait is pride...<br/>
The proper path is not that a person should merely be humble, but rather hold himself very lowly...<br/>
Therefore, our Sages commanded: ""Be very, very humble of spirit.""</p>
<p>It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary on the halachah cited above.</p>
<p>Possibly, it is the exaggerated contrasts in this set of traits that make it the most fitting example to demonstrate the principle of the middle path that the Rambam espouses. These gross differences allow for the possibility of clear distinctions.</i> and turns to the other extreme and carries himself lowly is called pious. This is the quality of piety<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which represents a deviation from the mean.</i>. However, if he separates himself [from pride] only to the extent that he reaches the mean and displays humility, he is called wise. This is the quality of wisdom. The same applies with regard to other character traits<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., there is a mean which is the path of wisdom, and a deviation from that course with a positive intent, which is the path of piety.</i>.<br>The pious of the early generations would bend their temperaments from the intermediate path towards [either of] the two extremes. For some traits they would veer towards the final extreme, f<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> excess (<i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4)</i>or others, towards the first extreme. This is referred to<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> by our Sages...</i> as [behavior] beyond the measure of the law.<br>We are commanded<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Sifre</i> (on Deuteronomy 13:5  states: 'You shall walk after God, your Lord' - this is a positive commandment."" The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tetze</i>, p. 270) also makes a similar statement. However, neither source elaborates.</p>
<p>Among the <i>Geonim</i>, the <i>Ba'al Halachot Gedolot</i> does list it as a commandment. Rav Sa'adiah Gaon does not include it as a specific commandment.</p>
<p><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 610) include this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. However, the Rambam's inclusion of this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot is somewhat problematic. In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any ""general mitzvah"" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, ""Observe My statutes"" (Leviticus 19:19  or ""Be holy"" (Leviticus 19:2  are not included in the 613 mitzvot. On the surface, the command the Rambam mentions here also seems to be an all encompassing charge to develop ourselves spiritually without any specific activity.</p>
<p>Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, was asked this question, and he explained that here the specific activity implied by this commandment is the development of our emotions and character traits. A somewhat deeper perspective can be gained from the Rambam's own description of the mitzvah. When listing the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot, he states that the mitzvah is ""to imitate God's ways"" and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he defines the mitzvah as ""to imitate Him, blessed be He, according to our potential.""</p>
<p>The implication of these statements is that man has a constant obligation to carry out all of his deeds and guide the progress of his emotional development with the intent of imitating God. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot, Tavo</i> 5748, and note the commentary on the following halachah.)</i> to walk in these intermediate paths - and they are good and straight paths - as [Deuteronomy 28:9] states: ""And you shall walk in His ways<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the <i>Midrash Tanchumah, Shofetim</i> 15:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">And what are the ways of God? Righteousness and justice, as it is stated: ""And they will keep the path of God to do righteousness and justice"" (Genesis 18:19 .</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam uses the term <i>yotzer</i> - literally ""the One who forms"" - (which appears only one other time in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:7).</p>
<p>The Rambam describes God as the Creator with reference to the Divine qualities he describes in these halachot. Before the existence of the world and man, there would be no purpose for God to reveal these qualities, for until man's creation, no one could learn from or emulate them.</p>
<p>[The word <i>yotzer</i> may also be used because of its connection to the word <i>yeitzer</i>, meaning drive or inclination. (See Rashi, Genesis 2:7.)]</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A trait possessed by a person produces activities naturally and spontaneously.

To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.</p>
<p>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as ""slow to anger."" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is ""piety."" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam describes this mitzvah in the following halachah. Indeed, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include the paragraph we have just explained as the beginning of Halachah 6.</p>
<co:rambam_commentary halacha=""6"">
<p>As emphasized in the introduction to this text, the Rambam has structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intent of ""revealing all the laws to the great and to the small with regard to each and every mitzvah."" He does not mention philosophical and ethical concepts unless they are halachot - i.e., practical directives for our behavior.</p>
<p>In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God's ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve. Having laid down this foundation, he is able to define that mitzvah in this halachah and begin offering directives for its fulfillment in Halachah 7.</i>."""
Human Dispositions 1.6,"[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (Exodus 14:2  and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.</p>
<p>It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">[Deuteronomy 13:5 states]: ""You shall walk after God, your Lord."" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: ""Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire"" (Deuteronomy 4:24 ?<br/>
Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.<br/>
Just as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;<br/>
God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;<br/>
God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;<br/>
God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.</p>
<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.</p>
<p>There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the ""resemblance of God"" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.</i>:<br/>
Just as He is called ""Gracious,"" you shall be gracious;<br/>
Just as He is called ""Merciful,"" you shall be merciful;<br/>

Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.</i> called God by other titles: ""Slow to anger,"" ""Abundant in kindness,"" ""Righteous,"" ""Just,"" ""Perfect,"" ""Almighty,"" ""Powerful,"" and the like. [They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.</i>. A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him to the extent of his ability."

According to the opinions which maintain that they do, the concepts that follow are derived from the exegesis of a Biblical verse. (See <i>Menachot</i> 39b.) According to the Rambam, who maintains that the requirement of tzitzit on these garments is Rabbinic in origin, we must assume that these concepts were part of the Rabbinic ordinance requiring tzitzit for these garments (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>, the white strands should be made from the same fabric as the garment itself.

Though the prohibition against <i>sha'atnez</i> is lifted for this garment, it is lifted only when there is no alternative but to do so (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>ne might think that it should be permitted, because <i>sha'atnez</i> is permitted to be used for tzitzit, as evident from the fact that <i>techelet</i> is made using woolen strands, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Using linen strands for a woolen garment or vice versa</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Chapter 2, Halachot 1- 2.</i>nd yet it should be placed on a linen garment.

<p>The <i>Tanya</i> (<i>Iggeret HaTeshuvah</i>, Chapter 1) explains the rationale for this principle. Man's purpose in this world is to spread Godly light through the observance of mitzvot. Accordingly, the observance of these mitzvot is always given preference when there is such a conflict.</p>

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.2,"The gentiles established various different services for each particular idol and image. These services do not [necessarily] resemble each other.

<p>For this reason, a court must know the types of worship [practiced by gentiles] - Note Chapter 2, Halachah 2, which forbids the study of idolatrous practices.

I will do the same.'""<br>For this reason, a court must know the types of worship [practiced by gentiles], because an idolater is stoned to death only when we know that [he has worshiped a false god] in the mode in which it is traditionally worshiped."

Hence, it - as opposed to bringing a burnt offering or pouring a libation - cannot be derived from the prohibition against sacrificing, and requires a unique verse of its own.</i>. The same applies to one who brings a burnt offering or pours a libation. Sprinkling [blood]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> before an idol or on its altar</i> is considered the same as pouring a libation."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.4,"[Even if] one pours feces before it or pours a libation of urine from a chamber pot before it, one is liable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These are considered as libations (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 50b), for which one is held liable even if this is not the mode in which the deity is worshiped.</i>. If one slaughters a locust before it, one is not liable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because even the gentiles do not offer sacrifices of such animals</p>
<p>The Ra'avad holds one liable even for the slaughter of such an animal or of a locust, explaining that although the Rambam's decision reflects certain opinions mentioned in the Talmud, the final decision is that one is held liable. He explains that such forms of slaughter are much closer to the concept of the slaughter for sacrifice than the offering of feces or urine are to the service of libation.</i>, unless this is the mode of service of that deity<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in which instance one would be held liable, based on the principles stated in Halachah 2.</i>. Similarly, if one slaughters an animal lacking a limb for it, one is not liable, unless this is the manner of service of this deity.<br>[The following rules apply when] a false god is worshiped by [beating with] a staff [before it]:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This interpretation is also followed by the<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 139:3.</i> If one breaks a staff before it, one is liable [for the worship of false gods]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> To justify the seeming difficulty in the Rambam's decisions mentioned by the Ra'avad (see above), the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that since staffs figure in the worship of this deity, an act that resembles slaughter that is performed with a staff is significant. In contrast, animals lacking limbs and locusts are never used in the service of such deities; hence, their slaughter is of no consequence.</p>
<p>[Note, however, the Ramah, who explains that one is liable only when the deity is worshiped by breaking the stick.]</i>, and [the deity] is forbidden. If one threw a staff before it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since this activity resembles pouring a libation before an idol</i>, one is held liable, but [the deity] is not forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This decision makes the Rambam's line of reasoning difficult to follow. If throwing the staff is not comparable to sprinkling blood, why is one held liable for it? Accordingly, some commentaries have explained that this decision applies only when the deity is worshiped by throwing staffs. The <i>Pri Chadash</i>, however, differentiates between the liability of the worshiper (for which a sprinkling that spatters is not required) and the prohibition of the worship of the deity (for which it is).</i>, because throwing a staff is not considered equivalent to sprinkling blood. The staff remains as it was, while the blood spatters [in different directions]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the reason that these services are considered significant even though the deity is not normally worshiped in this manner is that these services were performed in the Temple, the analogy must be complete. Thus, the entity poured or thrown before the deity must spatter, as blood spatters when sprinkled on the altar (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).</p>
<p>A person who accepts any one of the various false gods - which already exist</i>.<br>A person who accepts any one of the various false gods as a deity is liable for [execution by] stoning<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam mentions that one is liable for stoning specifically. Generally, the term ""liable"" means ""liable to bring a sacrifice."" In this instance, however, a person who makes such a statement inadvertently is not obligated to bring a sacrifice. A sacrifice is only brought when one performs a deed in violation of the Torah's command (<i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:2).</i>. Even one who lifted up a brick<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that this expression is merely a figure of speech. There is no need to perform a deed - lifting up the brick - for one to be held liable.</i> and said, ""You are my god,"" or the like, is liable. Even if he retracted his statements in the midst of speaking<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained above (Chapter 2, Halachah 9), this term has a specific meaning, the amount of time it takes to say שלום עליך רבי.</i> and said, ""This is not my God,"" his retraction is not significant and he should be stoned [to death]."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.5,"Anyone who serves a false god through its accepted mode of service - even if he does so in a derisive manner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., both the act he performs and his intent in performing it is to abuse the false deity</i> - is liable. What is implied? When a person defecates before Pe'or to repudiate it, or throws a stone at Marculis to repudiate it - since this is the manner of serving them - the person is liable and must bring a sacrifice [to atone for] his inadvertent transgression."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.6,"[The following rules apply when] a person serves a false deity out of love - i.e., he desires an image because its service is very attractive<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries note that the Rambam interprets ""out of love"" differently from ""out of fear."" ""Out of love"" refers to a love for the image and its service, while ""out of fear"" means fear of what the deity can do to the person.</p>
<p>Rav Kapach explains the Rambam's position, justifying the need for such a difference in interpretation. Most idolaters do not worship their images out of a genuine conviction that they are the true god, but rather for the benefit they feel this service will bring them. Therefore, were a person to serve an idol with this intent in mind, the Rambam would hold him liable. In contrast, were he to serve out of fear, he is not considered to be acting on his own volition, and hence is not held responsible.</i> - or when one serves it out of his fear of it - i.e., he fears that it will harm him - as the [idol] worshipers fear [their deities as sources of] benefit and harm: If he accepts it as a god<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and serves it as an act of worship</i>, he is liable to be stoned to death. If he serves it out of love or fear<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> without accepting it as a god - even though he served it</i> through its accepted mode of service or through one of the four services [mentioned above]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in Halachah 3,</i>, he is not held liable.<br>One who embraces a false deity, kisses it, sweeps before it, mops before it, washes it, anoints it, dresses it, places shoes upon it, or performs any similar act of deference violates a negative commandment, as [implied by Exodus 20:5]: ""Do not serve them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that punishment is not given because this prohibition is a לאו שבכללות - i.e., it includes many different forbidden acts. Lashes are not given for the violation of such a prohibition, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3.</p>
<p>To explain: The prohibition, ""Do not serve them,"" is twofold in nature. It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.</p>
<p>Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes. Since, in essence, this prohibition is not associated with lashes, even the many transgressions of a lesser nature which are also included within this prohibition are also not punishable in this manner (Rav Kapach).</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This commandment is described in Halachot 2 and 3.</i>."" Such acts are also ""service."" The offender is, nevertheless, not liable for lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah].<br>If one of the above services was the accepted mode of worship [of a particular deity] and a person performed this service as an act of worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and not merely as an expression of emotion. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the addition of the words ""as an act of worship,"" noting that in Halachah 5, the Rambam holds one liable for performing the service with which Pe'or or Marculis was worshiped, even though one's intent was to repudiate the idols. Thus, it appears that once a person performs a service which is the accepted mode of worship, his intent is no longer significant.</p>
<p>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> resolves this difficulty, explaining that the extent of liability is different. In the previous halachah, the offender was liable for a sin offering alone, while here,</i>, he is liable [for execution]."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.7,"If a splinter becomes stuck in a person's foot before an idol, he should not bend down to remove it, because it appears that he is bowing down to the idol<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 12a states that if the person turns his back or side to the idol, his bowing would not be considered to be an act of deference, and no prohibition is involved.</i>.<br>If money belonging to a person becomes scattered before an idol, he should not bow down and pick it up, because it appears that he is bowing down to the idol<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the commentaries' discussion of this law, it appears that if the person does bow down, he is not held liable for his actions. <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> questions the difference between this decision and Halachah 5, which holds a person who throws a stone to Marculis with the intent to repudiate it liable for a sin offering. He resolves that difficulty, explaining that in Halachah 5, the person intended to throw the stone at the idol. Since that act constitutes worship of this deity, he is held liable. In contrast, in our halachah the person did not bow down to the idol at all. The only reason the bowing is prohibited is that a mistaken impression might be created.</i>. Instead, he should sit down, and then pick it up."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.9,"A person who has a false god made for himself - even though he, himself, did not actually fashion it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions this statement, noting that lashes are not given for a transgression which does not involve a deed, and that speech is not ordinarily considered to be a deed. He explains that since the craftsman fashions the idol on behalf of the person who commissioned him, he is considered to be the latter's agent. Therefore, the one who commissioned him is held responsible for his deed.</p>
<p>The commentaries question this explanation, noting that - with the exception of a few specific instances - the Torah never holds a person who commissions another individual to commit a sin liable, since the person who actually committed the sin is responsible for his actions. Also, the Rambam's phraseology here implies that one is held liable regardless whether the craftsman is a Jew or gentile, and a gentile is never given the halachic status of an agent.</p>
<p>The following are among the resolutions offered to this difficulty:<br/>
a) A hired worker's actions - whether positive or negative - are always attributed to his employer (<i>Machaneh Efrayim, Hilchot Shutafim</i> 8).<br/>
b) The verse prohibiting this act reveals that this is one of the few exceptions to the general rule mentioned above, and in this case, the person who commissioned the agent is held liable (<i>Darchei HaMelech</i>).<br/>
c) Commenting on <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 13:2, the <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> explains that if it is possible to violate a particular prohibition by committing a deed, one is punished by lashes even when one violates it without committing a deed. The same concept can be applied here (<i>S'deh Chemed</i>).<br/>
d) The deed for which one is punished is not the command to make the idol, but rather its purchase or acquisition (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>, Alfandari).</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., he commissioned another person to make the idol for him.</i>, nor worship it - is [punished by] lashing, as [Exodus 20:5] states: ""Do not make for yourself an idol or any representation.""<br>Similarly, a person who actually fashions a false god for others, even for<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 3) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 214) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> gentile</i> idolaters, is [punished by] lashing, as [Leviticus 19:4] states: ""Do not make molten gods for yourselves."" Accordingly, a person who actually fashions a false god for himself receives two measures of lashes."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.10,"It is prohibited to make images for decorative purposes, even though they do not represent false deities<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., they were made as decorations and works of art, without any intent that they be worshiped.</i>, as [implied by Exodus 20:20]: ""Do not make with Me [gods of silver and gods of gold]."" This refers even to images of gold and silver which are intended only for decorative purposes, lest others err and view them as deities<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statement sheds light on an interesting Rabbinic debate. The Sages of the Talmud often established ""fences around the Torah"" - i.e., safeguards to prevent the violation of Torah law. (See <i>Avot</i> 1:1.) There is a question whether the Torah itself instituted prohibitions for such a purpose - i.e., are there mitzvot that are instituted without a self-contained goal of their own, but merely to prevent the violation of other prohibitions? (See <i>Lekach Tov</i> 8.)</p>
<p>From the Rambam's statements here (see also <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 7:8), it appears that he accepts such a premise. It appears that there is nothing intrinsically wrong in making statues per se. Nevertheless, since if such statues are made, the possibility exists that they may be worshiped, the Torah forbids us to make them.</i>.<br>It is forbidden to make decorative images of the human form alone. Therefore, it is forbidden to make human images with wood, cement, or stone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or any other material. The Rambam mentioned these materials because they were commonly used in his time.</i>. This [prohibition] applies when the image is protruding - for example, images and sculptures made in a hallway and the like.

As mentioned in the commentary to Halachah 6, the Ramban and other authorities maintain that if a synagogue was constructed with such a condition, guests may eat inside and it may be used for other mundane purposes.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> disagrees, maintaining that the condition has no effect while the synagogue is standing and applies only after it has been destroyed. Thus, were a synagogue to be built with such a condition, as were the synagogues in Babylonia in Talmudic times, mundane activities could be carried on within its premises after it was destroyed. However, even then, activities directly opposed to the sanctity of the synagogue, e.g., sowing crops on the land, are forbidden.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 151:11) quotes <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion. Interestingly, the Rambam does not mention either the Ramban's or <i>Tosafot's</i> interpretation of the possibility of making the condition mentioned in <i>Megillah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> with the exception of sweeping and mopping them.

The Talmud comments that one is not allowed to pull out the grass to use as fodder for animals, but one may pull out the grass and leave it there.</p>
<p>In his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam writes that one is permitted to pull the grass out and leave it in its place. The published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (which we have quoted) appears to imply that one should pull them out (i.e., it is imperative to do so). However, the version of the halachah found in authoritative manuscripts is closer to the understanding in the Commentary to the Mishnah.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:10) quotes the version of the halachah in the published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. However, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (151:29) quotes the Commentary to the Mishnah.</i> so that it will be seen by the people [in the hope that] it will rouse their spirits and rebuild them."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.12,"One should not tear down a synagogue in order to build another in its place or in another place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 65), which states that destroying a synagogue is a transgression of a Torah commandment.

Instead, one should build the [new synagogue] and then, one [may] tear down the [previous] one lest unforeseen difficulties arise [which prevent it] from being built<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The second reason mentioned in the Talmud is so that people will have a place to pray in the interim. The Talmud notes that different corollaries result from these two explanations. If there is another synagogue in the city, according to the second explanation (not mentioned by the Rambam), one could tear down the first synagogue while building a new one, since people would be able to pray in the other synagogue in the interim. However, according to the explanation quoted by the Rambam, it would be improper to destroy the synagogue lest the new synagogue never be built.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 152:1) quotes the Rambam's decision. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 152:4 states that this law applies even if all the money necessary to build the new synagogue has been collected.</i>.<br>This applies even to a single wall of [a synagogue].

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.15,"Similar [principles apply] if a congregation collected money to build a house of study or a synagogue or to purchase an ark, a mantle or a case [for a Torah scroll], or a Torah scroll, and desired to change [the purpose for which] all the [funds] had been [originally] collected<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Just as it is forbidden to sell sacred articles in order to purchase articles of lesser sanctity...</i>.<br>It is forbidden to change [the purpose for which the funds will be used] except from a matter of lesser sanctity to one of greater sanctity<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Moshe Cohen questions the Rambam's decision, asking why it is forbidden to make a change of this nature. Even bricks intended for use in constructing a synagogue can be used for other purposes as long as they have not been actually built into the synagogue (See <i>Megillah</i> 26b).</p>
<p>The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:2) explains that money collected for the purchase of religious articles does not possess the sanctity of those articles. However, since the donors intended that the money be used to purchase religious articles, its use is constrained by the terms of an implicit vow that it be used for this purpose. Despite this limitation, the congregation may use these funds for another purpose associated with a mitzvah and substitute other funds to accomplish the purpose for which these funds were originally collected. (Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 153:5, who does not accept the latter conclusion.)</p>
<p>The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> (153) supports the <i>Turei Zahav's</i> position based on <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:20, which states that a sacred utensil made with the intent that it be used in the Temple is not considered as ""sacred"" until it has actually been used for its intended purpose.</i>. However, if [the congregation] accomplished the purpose for which they had [originally] collected [the funds], they may use the remainder for whatever they desire.<br>All the components of a synagogue<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., the platform from which the Torah is read or its benches (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Megillah</i> 3:1)</i> are considered like the synagogue itself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and can only be sold for similar purposes.</p>
<p>Our Sages placed certain restrictions on the sale of the components of a synagogue. In <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 8:6, the Rambam writes:</p>

If [the sale] concerns a matter which is a mitzvah, it may be exchanged.... If the name of the donor has been forgotten, it is permitted to exchange [the object] even for a mundane matter.</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> 10:4, the Rambam states that the platform ""has no sanctity at all."" However, this statement should be interpreted to mean that the platform is not considered a ""sacred article"" like the others mentioned in that halachah.</i>. The curtain hanging before the ark is considered like the mantle of a Torah scroll<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since from time to time, it is placed under the Torah scroll (<i>Megillah</i> 26b).</i>.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.16,"When do the above statements permitting the sale of a synagogue apply? In regard to a synagogue in a village.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.17,"The inhabitants of a village<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the previous Halachah.</i> who desire to sell their synagogue in order to build another synagogue with the money, or to buy an ark or Torah scroll with the money, must establish as a condition [of the sale] that the purchaser not use the building for a bathhouse, a leatherworks, a <i>mikveh</i>, or a laundry.<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The translation of the Hebrew, בית המים, is based on Rashi's commentary to <i>Megillah</i> 27b.

Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:9), Rav Yosef Karo mentions a latrine, but not a laundry.</p>
<p>The sanctity of the synagogue is transferred to the money received from its sale and the building itself is no longer considered as ""holy."" Nonetheless, using the premises for such purposes is considered degrading.</p>
<p>As support for the prohibition against using premises that had previously served as a synagogue for such purposes, the <i>Or Sameach</i> cites II Chronicles 8:11: ""I will not have a woman dwelling in the house of David... for the [places] where the ark of God has come are holy."" Although the ark had already been placed in the Temple, it was not becoming to the ark for Pharaoh's daughter to be allowed to live in a place where it had been kept.</i>f, at the time of the sale, the seven officials of the community made a condition in the presence of the entire community<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:7) states that a public announcement of the sale is sufficient for it to be considered as if all the inhabitants of the city were present.</i> that the purchaser be allowed to use the building for the above purposes, he may."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.18,"Similarly, if the seven officials of the community made a condition in the presence of the entire community that [after the community accomplished the purpose for which they sold the synagogue], the remainder of the funds could be used for mundane purposes, they may be used for such purposes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:7) accepts the opinion of Rashi, the Ra'avad, and Rabbenu Asher, who differ with the Rambam and maintain that the entire proceeds from the sale of a synagogue can be used for mundane purposes if the sale was carried out in the above manner.</p>
<p>In his <i>Kessef Mishnah</i>, Rav Yosef Karo explains the difference between these positions as follows. These authorities do not accept the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Megillah</i> 26a-b mentioned in the previous Halachah, and maintain that a certain measure of sanctity always remains in the synagogue. The Rambam maintains that the sanctity is transferred to the money received for the synagogue. Therefore, the condition made by the city officials can never effect the entire sum of money. Rather, the major portion must always be used for a sacred object.</p>
<p>[Interestingly, in his <i>Kessef Mishnah</i>, Rav Yosef Karo points out the advantages of the Rambam's position. However, in his<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, he accepts the decisions of the other authorities.]</i>. Thus, after the money has been used for building another synagogue, for purchasing an ark, a mantle or case [for a Torah scroll], <i>chumashim</i>, or a Torah scroll, the remainder may be used for mundane purposes in accordance with their condition, and may be used for whatever they please."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.21,"Although the people pray in a city's main street on fast days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Ta'anit</i> 4:1 states:</p>

<p>and ma'amadot, - The mention of <i>ma'amadot</i> in this context in <i>Megillah</i> 26a (the source for this halachah), and here, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has raised questions. In <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 6:1-2, the Rambam describes the <i>ma'amadot</i> as follows:</p>

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"Anyone who intentionally eats an olive's size<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Whenever the Torah uses the verb אכל (eat) in the context of a mitzvah or a prohibition, it refers to the consumption of at least a minimum amount, established by <i>Eruvin</i> 4b as the size of an olive.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that the measure of a כזית (an olive's size) cannot be determined by measuring an average olive today. Rather, it is dependent on the measure established by the Sages and this is the subject of debate by the Rabbinic authorities. The <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) explains that the Rambam considers an olive as one third the size of an egg (כביצה, a more familiar Talmudic measure). In terms of modern measurements, this olive size would be between 16.6 and 24 grams, according to various Halachic opinions.</p>
<p><i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Chullin</i> 103a) differs, and defines a כזית(the size of an olive) as one half the size of an egg (between 25.6 and 36 grams according to the various opinions). With regard to the practical application of the law (<i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) advises that in all questions of Torah law, <i>Tosefot's</i> opinion should be followed.

<p><i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 29b) states that the prohibition against chametz being seen in one's property falls into the above category, because one can correct the violation of this prohibition by fulfilling the positive commandment to destroy chametz. Thus, it appears that a person can never be held liable for lashes for this transgression.</p>
<p>Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that of Rav Chayim Soloveitchik, who explains that <i>Tosefot's</i> statements apply only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who maintains that chametz must be destroyed by burning. However, according to the Sages (whose opinion is accepted by the Rambam, Halachah 3:11), who maintain that chametz can be destroyed by any means, not necessarily burning, the prohibition against possessing chametz is not considered a לאו הניתק לעשה.</p>
<p>What is the essential difference between these opinions: Rabbi Yehudah maintains that the fundamental aspect of the mitzvah to destroy chametz revolves upon the article itself (חפצה); it is a mitzvah to destroy chametz. In contrast, the Sages maintain that the mitzvah centers on the person (גברה); he is commanded to remove all chametz from his possession.</p>
<p>According to Rabbi Yehudah, since the commandment revolves around the chametz itself, its destruction directly ""corrects"" the sin of its possession. In contrast, according to the Sages, the positive commandment of ridding one's house of chametz is merely a reinforcement of the prohibition against its possession, and the fulfillment of the positive commandment does not have the power to ""correct"" the violation of the prohibition.</i>.<br>However, if he possessed chametz before Pesach, and when Pesach came he did not destroy it and left it in his possession, even though he transgresses two prohibitions, according to the Torah, he is not lashed, for he did not perform a deed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sh'vuot</i> 21b states: ""The transgression of any prohibition which does not involve a deed is not punishable by lashing.""</i>.

A thief stole chametz from a person before Pesach and returned it to him after the holiday. Even though the person had no opportunity to destroy it before Pesach, it is forbidden.</p>
<p>In that responsum, the <i>Nodah BiYhudah</i> also raises the following question: A person died on the fourteenth of Nisan without nullifying or selling his chametz. Are his heirs forbidden to benefit from that chametz or not? He maintains that although the Rambam would probably prohibit benefiting from this chametz, there are rationales on the basis of which its use may be permitted. [Other authorities (note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Kuntres Acharon</i> 435) do not accept this conclusion.]</i>. [These stringencies were instituted] lest a person leave chametz in his possession during Pesach in order to benefit from it after Pesach."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.5,"If, on Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> maintain that this principle does not apply until the holiday itself actually begins. Thus, even if chametz became mixed with other substances on the fourteenth of Nisan, after the time chametz is forbidden, the mixture is bound by the laws regarding the nullification of forbidden objects (ביטול איסורים) that apply throughout the entire year.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that a simple interpretation of the Rambam's statements leads to the conclusion that he accepts this opinion. Though others, among them the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, do not accept this view, it is accepted as Halachah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 447:2).</i>, even the slightest amount of chametz becomes mixed together with another substance, either of its kind<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When the prohibited substance is of the same kind as the forbidden substance (e.g., improperly slaughtered meat mixed with properly slaughtered meat), all that is required to nullify the prohibition is that the permitted substance constitutes the majority of the mixture (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:1).</i> or not of its kind<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for example, a mixture of flour with any other substance.</i>, [the entire mixture] is forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The above principles do not apply with regard to chametz on Pesach. Even the slightest mixture of chametz may not be eaten, nor may benefit be derived from it. In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> (15:9), the Rambam explains that this stringency is instituted because chametz is a דבר שיש לו מתירין (a substance which later will become permitted).</p>
<p>A דבר שיש לו מתירין which becomes mixed together with a permitted substance of its own kind is never permitted to be used because of the following rationale: Since its use in its entirety will later become permitted, there is no need to grant a leniency allowing it to be eaten when forbidden.</p>
<p>Similarly, with regard to chametz on Pesach: There is no prohibition against using a mixture of chametz after Pesach. Hence, there is no need to grant permission to eat such a mixture on Pesach itself, even though the quantity of the permitted substance far surpasses that of the chametz.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a stricter dimension to chametz than to any other דבר שיש לו מתירין. Generally, a דבר שיש לו מתירין is permitted if it becomes mixed with a substance of another kind to the extent that its taste can no longer be discerned. However, this leniency is not granted regarding mixtures of chametz. Since Exodus 12:20 states: ""You must not eat any leaven,"" the severity of the prohibition obligates additional stringency.</i>.<br>Though it is forbidden to benefit from chametz which a Jew possessed on Pesach, if it became mixed with another substance, whether of its kind or not of its kind, it is permitted to be eaten after Pesach. [The Sages] only penalized and forbade [the use of] chametz itself. A mixture [containing chametz possessed on Pesach] is permitted to be eaten after Pesach."

Thus, from the beginning of the sixth hour, it is forbidden to eat or benefit from chametz, based on Rabbinic law. During the rest of the day, from the seventh hour on, eating chametz is forbidden because of the Torah law.<br>D<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 1:4), the Rambam explains that it is possible that a person may err in his estimation of the time by an hour and thus, transgress the Rabbinic prohibition against possessing chametz at the sixth hour.</p>
<p>In a Responsa, the Rambam replies to the following question: The passage in <i>Pesachim</i> which is the source for this halachah appears to imply that a person may make an error of over two hours. Indeed, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi states the matter as such in his <i>halachot</i>. If so, why did the Rambam alter the explanation of the law.</p>
<p>In a reply which reflects his overall purpose in the composition of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam answers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mentioned a mistake of an hour which is a common error because my intention in composing this text is to bring the matters closer to our understanding or what is general practice.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as stated in the previous halachah.</i>uring the fifth hour of the day, we do not eat chametz, lest the day be cloudy and we err between the fifth and six hours.

Circumcision 1.1,"Circumcision is a positive mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 215) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 2) consider this one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> [whose lack of fulfillment] is punishable by <i>karet<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Premature death at the hand of God (<i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 28a) and a severe spiritual punishment, the ""soul's being cut off,"" and not being granted a share in the world to come (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1,5).</i></i>, as [Genesis 17:14] states: ""And an uncircumcised male who does not circumcise his foreskin - this soul will be cut off from his people.""<br>A father<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and not a mother (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a)</i> is commanded to circumcise his son, and a master, his slaves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, the responsibility for the mitzvah is surely the master's. This circumcision is one of the stages in the process by which the slave attains the status of <i>eved C'na'ani</i>, an intermediate rung between a gentile and a Jew. He is obligated to fulfill all the negative commandments and all those positive commandments that are not associated with a specific time. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 12:11.)</i>. This applies both to those who are born in his home and to those purchased by him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Genesis 17:27, which relates that Abraham circumcised both these categories of servants.</i>. If the father or the master transgressed and did not circumcise them, he negated the fulfillment of a positive commandment.

T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is obvious from the proof-text quoted above.</i>he court is obligated to circumcise that son or slave at the proper time and should not leave an uncircumcised male among the Jewish people or their slaves."
Circumcision 1.2,"We may not circumcise a person's son without his knowledge<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 7:13-14, where the Rambam describes the prohibition against ""stealing"" the performance of a mitzvah from a colleague, and the fine of ten gold pieces for doing so. The Ramah (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 382:1) explicitly associates this concept with circumcising a person's son without his knowledge.</i>, unless he has transgressed and did not circumcise him. [In such an instance,] the court must circumcise<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the obligation mentioned in the previous halachah falls upon them</i> [the child] against [the father's] will.<br>If the matter does not become known to the court and they do not circumcise him, when [the child] reaches <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he is obligated to circumcise himself. W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there are three aspects to the mitzvah of circumcision:</p>
<p>a) to remove the foreskin;<br/>
b) to be circumcised;<br/>
c) not to be uncircumcised. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)&lt; /p&gt;</p>
<p>The first aspect involves a single deed. The second and third dimensions, however, are ongoing qualities that a person continues to possess even after the deed of circumcision is completed. Thus, the <i>Or Zarua</i> quotes <i>Menachot</i> 43b, which relates that when King David entered the bathhouse, he was upset for he was ""naked,"" without mitzvot. When he remembered that he was circumcised, he relaxed, realizing that he was still involved with the performance of a mitzvah.</p>
<p>This indicates that, even years after his circumcision, he was considered to be fulfilling the mitzvah. In contrast, with regard to the mitzvot of tefillin and tzitzit, although he had just removed them, he was no longer considered to be involved in the performance of these mitzvot.</i>ith each and every day that passes after he has reached <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he negates a positive commandment. He is not, however, liable for <i>karet</i> until he dies uncircumcised, h<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned above, there are two dimensions to the punishment of <i>karet</i>: premature death and the cutting off of the soul. According to the Rambam, a person who does not circumcise himself is liable only for the second aspect of this punishment, since until he dies, it is not known whether he will perform the mitzvah or not (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</p>
<p>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statements, stating that each day he does not perform the mitzvah, he is liable for <i>karet</i> and is worthy of premature death. (Even according to the Ra'avad, were the person to circumcise himself, he would no longer be liable for <i>karet</i>).</i>aving intentionally [failed to perform the mitzvah]."
Circumcision 1.3,"A master is obligated to circumcise both a slave who was born as the property of a Jewish owner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the ""home-born slave"" mentioned in Genesis 17:12</i> and a slave purchased from the gentiles. [There is, however, a difference between the two.] A home-born slave should be circumcised on the eighth day [of his life].

The above verse states that ""all those born in your house"" - i.e., also slaves - should be circumcised on the eighth day (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 135b).</i>n contrast, a slave who is purchased should be circumcised on the day he was purchased. If he was purchased on the day he was born, he should be circumcised on that day."
Circumcision 1.4,"There are, however<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> certain exceptions to the rules mentioned in the previous halachah that are also mentioned in <i>Shabbat</i> 135b.

Circumcision 1.5,"If a person purchased a maidservant for her offspring<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his responsum cited above, the Rambam compares this to a person who buys a tree for its fruit - i.e., he is not the actual owner of the tree, but is entitled to all the fruit it produces. Similarly, in this instance, the master is not the owner of the maidservant; what he has purchased is the right to her offspring. Therefore, none of the offspring are considered ""home-born,"" and must be circumcised immediately.</i>, or purchased a maidservant with the intent of not immersing her as a slave, even though her offspring is born in his domain, the child should be circumcised on the day he was born<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The first instance mentioned does not require explanation. With regard to the second category, the Rambam elaborates:</i>.<br>[This ruling was granted, because] this child is considered as if he alone has been purchased [by his master], and it is as if he purchased him this day.

(See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:4.)</i>hich is a period when it is undetermined whether it is considered day or night, we count from the night, and he is circumcised on the ninth day [following the day he was born], which could be the eighth day.<br>W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 262:7) states that night depends on the appearance of three stars, and not on when the evening service is recited.</i>hen a child is born <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> on Friday, his circumcision does not supersede the Sabbath prohibitions, because the Sabbath prohibitions are never superseded because of a doubtful situation. Rather, he should be circumcised on [the following] Sunday."
Circumcision 1.16,"A sick person<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This applies not only to children who are circumcised on the eighth day of their lives, but also to those (e.g., converts or slaves) who are circumcised when they are older.</i> should not be circumcised until he regains his health. Seven full days should be counted from the time he regains his health until he is circumcised<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:5), the Rambam writes:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Until he fully recovers from his illness and the weakness from his sickness passes. He should wait seven days from the time the weakness passes.... Only afterwards, should he be circumcised.</p>
<p>Thus, we see that the Rambam intends that the person to be circumcised fully regain his health, and then wait an additional seven days.</i>.<br>When does the above apply? When he recovers from high fever or from a similar illness<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., an illness that affects a person's entire body (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 262:2)</i>. If, however, a person's eyes hurt, as soon as his eyes heal he may be circumcised immediately. The same applies in all similar circumstances."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.1","The term ""the frond of the date palm"" employed by the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Leviticus 23:40.</i> refers to the branches of a date palm as they sprout, before their leaves separate<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, if the leaves spread out and were later bound together by human activity, it is not acceptable (Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 645:2).</i> and spread out in various directions. Rather, they should appear as a scepter<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, too, our Sages have emphasized the homiletic lesson to be derived from this shape. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are days of judgement. The lulav can be considered as the Jews' scepter of victory, acknowledging that they have prevailed (<i>Medrash Tanchumah, Emor</i>).</i>. This is called a lulav.

The ""fruit of the beautiful tree"" mentioned in the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Leviticus, ibid.</i> is the etrog.<br>The ""boughs of covered trees"" mentioned in the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Leviticus, ibid.</i> refer to the [species of] myrtle whose leaves surround its branch; i.e., there will be three or more leaves in each ring<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> on the same level.</p>
<p>Our translation follows the interpretation of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, who requires that the three leaves be on the same level over the entire length of the myrtle. However, other opinions interpret the Rambam's words to mean that a myrtle may be used if the leaves of merely one ring are on the same level. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (and similarly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 646:5) maintain that a myrtle is kosher if the leaves grow properly over three handbreadths (its minimum size), or at least the majority of that distance.</i>. However, if there are two leaves on one level, with a third leaf slightly higher than them, that is not considered to be ""covered."" Rather, it is called a wild myrtle.

"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.3","The term ""willows of the brook"" mentioned by the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Leviticus, ibid.</i> does not include just any plant that grows by a brook, but rather a particular species, which is called the ""willows of the brook.""<br>Its leaf is extended as a brook<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., it comes to a point, rather than being rounded (<i>Sukkah</i> 33b).</p>
<p>This characteristic is also quoted as an explanation of the name ""willows of the brook"" (Rabbenu Asher).</i>, its edge is smooth, and its stem is red. It is called a willow. The majority of this species grow near brooks. Therefore, it is called the ""willows of the brook<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, the use of that name is not meant to be exclusive...</i>."" Even if this species grew in the desert or on a mountain, it would be kosher."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.4","There is another species which resembles the willow. However, its leaf is rounded, its edge resembles a saw<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., its edge is very jagged, with large protrusions</i>, and its stem is not red. This is called a <i>tzaftzefah</i>. It is unfit [to be used for the mitzvah].<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for it is not considered to be merely a different type of willow, but rather another species entirely.</i>here is another type of willow, whose leaf does not have a smooth edge, but it is not like a saw. Rather, it has tiny juttings, like the edge of a small sickle. It is kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 647:6 mentions that willows are frequently picked by young children who are not learned and may mistake a non-kosher species for a kosher one. Hence, the purchaser should carefully examine the willows before purchasing them.</i>.<br>All the above definitions were explained according to the oral tradition transmitted by Moses, our teacher."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.5","These four species are considered to be one mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In contrast to putting on the head tefillin and the arm tefillin, which are considered to be two mitzvot. Here, taking all four species is considered to be a single mitzvah...</i>, and each one<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> of the species...</i> is required for its performance. All of them [together] are called the mitzvah of lulav<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the lulav is the tallest of all the species, the entire mitzvah is referred to by this name (<i>Sukkah</i> 37b).</i>. One may not diminish them or add to them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> doing so violates the commandment תוסיף בל (Deuteronomy 13:1 , which forbids adding to the Torah's commandments.</i>. If one of the species cannot be found, a similar species may not be substituted for it."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.6","The most desirable way of performing the mitzvah is to bind the lulav, myrtle, and willow together, thus making a single, unified entity from the three of them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 11b explains that binding the three species together is considered more attractive than taking them each individually. Thus, taking the species in this manner conforms to the general directive requiring us to perform the mitzvot in the most esthetically appealing manner possible.</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 34b mentions an exegetic teaching that explains why the etrog is not bound together with the other species.</i>.<br>Before one takes them to perform the mitzvah, he should recite the blessing on the mitzvah of taking the lulav<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation follows the commentary of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who notes that in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15, the Rambam states that if one recites the blessing before taking the lulav in his hand, he should conclude the blessing <i>...v'tzivanu litol lulav</i>. The blessing should be concluded <i>...v'tzivanu al netilat lulav</i> only if one has already taken the lulav in his hands.</i>, for all the others are dependent upon it.<br>Afterwards, he takes this bound entity in his right hand and the etrog in his left hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since three of the four species are bound together, they are held in the hand which the Torah considers of greater prominence (<i>Sukkah</i> 37b).</i>. He must take them as they grow - i.e., their roots below towards the earth, and their heads upward towards the sky<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even though the etrog hangs from the tree with the <i>pitam</i> downwards, its ""upright"" position is when the <i>pitam</i> faces upward (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 651:12).</i>.<br>If a person did not bind them together, but rather took them one by one, he has fulfilled his obligation, provided he possesses all four species. However, if he has only one species or he is lacking one species, he should not take them until he acquires the remaining species."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.7","How many does one take of each of them? One lulav<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 34b derives this concept from the fact that Leviticus 23:40 writes כפת without a ו, implying a single entity, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1.</i>, one etrog, two willow branches<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because the above verse states ""willows of the brook,"" using the plural, and thus two are required (ibid.)</i>, and three myrtle branches. If one would like to add more myrtle<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> also add ""and willow."" However, most of the manuscripts and texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> omit that phrase. Furthermore, in one of his responsa, the Rambam states that since the Talmud mentions adding only myrtles, it is improper to add any of the other species.</i> branches so that the bundle will be larger, he may. Indeed, it is considered to be an adornment of the mitzvah. However, it is forbidden to add to or reduce the numbers of the other species<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because they are not considered to be ""adornments.""</i>. If one adds to or reduces their number, it is not acceptable."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.8","What is the required length of each of these species?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 650:8 states that if the species are smaller than the minimum limits established, they may not be used throughout the festival. Though certain leniencies are granted after the first day, they do not apply regarding this matter.</i> The lulav may not be less than four handbreadths. [Beyond that,] regardless of its length, it is kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Menachot</i> 42a states that a lulav has a minimum length, but no maximum length.</i>. Its length is measured only from its <i>shidrah</i> and not from the tips of the leaves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., its full length.</i>.<br>The myrtle and the willow may not be less than three handbreadths. [Beyond that,] regardless of their length, they are kosher. Even if each branch has only three fresh leaves on it, they are kosher, provided the leaves are at the top of the branch<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 33a states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If most of [the myrtle's] leaves dried out, but three fresh leaves remain, it is kosher.</p>
<p>Rav Chisda said: ""Provided they are at the top of each branch.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rambam maintains that the same principles can also be applied to the willow.</p>
<p>[Note the commentary on Halachah 8:5, which mentions certain relevant principles. Indeed, in general, this clause appears to be more closely related to the principles mentioned in the following chapter, where the Rambam mentions the characteristics that disqualify the various species, rather than in this chapter, where he relates the fundamental requirements of each one. Based on <i>Sukkah</i> 34a, which relates that myrtles which are not dry (a factor still common in many Diaspora communities today) are very difficult to find, we can interpret this as an almost parenthetical expression teaching that freshness is not among the fundamental requirements for a myrtle.]</i>.<br>If one has bound [the other species together with] the lulav, the <i>shidrah</i> of the lulav must extend beyond the myrtle and the willow a handbreadth or more.<br>The minimum size of an etrog is the size of an egg<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> 57.6 cubic centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>; in this context, 100 cubic centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i>. [Beyond that,] regardless of its size, it is kosher."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.9","Once a person lifts up these four species - whether he lifts them up together<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as described in Halachah 6.</i> or one after the other - whether in his right hand or in his left hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although, in Halachah 6, the Rambam suggested holding the lulav together with the myrtle and willows together in his right hand and the etrog in his left, this is the most desirable way of fulfilling the mitzvah. However, even if a person does not lift up the species in this manner...</i> - he has fulfilled his obligation. [This applies] only when he lifts them up as they grow<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachah 6 and the commentary on it.</i>. However, if he does not lift them up as they grow, he has not fulfilled his obligation.<br>The fulfillment of the mitzvah as the law [requires is as follows]: One should lift up the three species as they are bound together in one's right hand and the etrog in one's left hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> holding the etrog together with the lulav (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:11).</p>
<p>In the <i>Beit Yosef</i>, Rav Yosef Karo quotes the following story from the Recanti. The latter dreamed that he saw a particular pious individual writing God's name with a space separating the last ה from the first three letters. He could not comprehend the dream at all until the next day, when he saw that individual holding his etrog separate from his lulav (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 651:21).</i>. Then, one should pass them back and forth, up and down, and shake the lulav three times in each direction."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.10","What does the above entail? One passes the lulav forward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> once in each direction</i> and shakes the top of the lulav three times, brings it back<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to one's chest</i> and shakes the top of the lulav three times. One follows this same pattern when lifting it up and down<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, one will have shaken the lulav a total of 36 times.</i>.<br>At what point [in prayer] does one pass the lulav back and forth? During the reading of the <i>Hallel</i>, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which is recited in its entirety on each day of the Sukkot festival.</i>t the first and final recitation of the verse [Psalms 118:1, 118:29]: <i>Hodu Lado-nai ki tov...</i> and at the verse [Psalms 118:25]: <i>Ana Ado-nai hoshi'ah na</i>.<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is customary to repeat this verse when reciting the <i>Hallel</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651:8) relates that the lulav is passed back and forth both times the verse is recited.</i>t is acceptable to take the lulav throughout the entire day. However, it is not taken at night."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.11","If one wraps a cord of silver or gold around [the three species] as they are bound together<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:8) relates that the inhabitants of Jerusalem would wrap their lulavim together with golden cords.</i>, or wraps a [decorative] cloth around them and takes them, one fulfills his obligation. Taking the lulav through another medium is still considered to be taking it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., holding another substance in which the lulav is contained is still considered to be holding the lulav...</i>, provided [that medium] is one which gives honor and beauty [to the mitzvah, because]: ""any entity which makes a substance more attractive is not considered to be a separation.""<br>However, if one placed these species in a vase or a pot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 42a explains that this is unbecoming to the mitzvah.</i> and took them, one has not fulfilled one's obligation."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.12","If one binds the lulav together with the myrtle and the willow and separates between the lulav and the myrtle with a cloth or the like<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., a substance which does not contribute to the lulav's attractiveness</i>, it is considered to be a separation. If one separates between them with myrtle leaves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., using substances other than the three species used in the lulav</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., if the myrtle leaves fall off and collect between the lulav and the myrtle branches,</i>, it is not considered to be a separation, because an entity does not separate between its own kind.<br>One may bind the together with a string, a cord, or with any substance one desires, since binding it together is not a required element of the mitzvah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.13","The mitzvah of taking the lulav in every place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., even outside Jerusalem</i>, during every age - even on the Sabbath - applies only on the first day of the festival, as [Leviticus 23:40] states: ""And on the first day, you shall take<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachah 16. See also the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 4:2).</i>...""<br>In the holy place alone, it is to be taken on each of the seven days of the festival, as [the above verse] continues: ""and you shall rejoice before God, your Lord, [seven days].""<br>W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>hen the Sabbath falls during the [later] days, [the lulav] is not taken on the Sabbath. This is a decree<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> instituted by the Rabbis (<i>Sukkah</i> 43a)</i> lest one carry it four cubits in the public domain, as decreed regarding the shofar."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.14","Why was this decree not put in effect on the first day of the festival? Because [taking the lulav on that day] is a mitzvah from the Torah even outside of Jerusalem. Thus, the laws applying to it are not the same as those applying to the remaining days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Taking the lulav on the first day was obviously a matter of great importance. Hence, the Sages did not feel that the fear that perhaps a person might carry the lulav in the public domain was sufficient reason to nullify the mitzvah. In contrast, on the subsequent days the mitzvah is not considered to be so severe a matter. Hence, the mitzvah could be nullified in Jerusalem as well.</p>
<p>The Rabbis question why the Sages differentiated between the lulav and the shofar, and (as explained in Halachah 2:6), nullified the mitzvah of hearing the shofar when Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath. As explained in our commentary on that halachah, in Rabbenu Nissim's commentary on the tractate of <i>Sukkah</i>, he states that this decree was instituted only because in most Jewish communities, the people were not aware of the date the court had established for Rosh Hashanah. (Note the details of the explanation there.)</i>, because on the subsequent days of the festival a person is obligated to take the lulav only in the holy place."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.15","When the Temple was destroyed, [the Sages] ordained that the lulav be taken everywhere for the entire seven days of the festival, as a remembrance of the Temple.<br>O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 41a explains the source for the establishment of remembrances for the Temple practices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Jeremiah 30:17] states: ""'I will restore health to you. I will heal you of your wounds,"" says God. 'Because they called you an outcast. Zion, for whom no one cares.'</p>
<p>The verse states ""for whom no one cares,"" implying that a show of our care is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this basis, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai established a number of practices in remembrance of the Temple practices.</i>n each day, one recites the blessing on it:
<blockquote>
<i>[Baruch Attah Ado-nai...] asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu al netilat lulav.</i>
</blockquote>
b<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 6, the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15 that it is preferable to conclude the blessing, <i>litol lulav</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that the Rambam's present statement is only a reference to his previous one, and not a reversal of his opinion. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651:5) and all later authorities recommend reciting <i>al netilat lulav</i>.</i>ecause it a mitzvah ordained by the Rabbis.<br>This enactment, like the other enactments instituted by Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai when the Temple was destroyed [is only temporary]. When the Temple is rebuilt, these matters will return to their original status."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.16","While the Temple was standing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the day when a new month began was established through the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon.</i>, the lulav would be taken [in the holy place even] when the first day of Sukkot fell on the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as stated above in Halachah 13.</i>. The same applies in other places where they were certain that this day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the fifteenth of Tishre</i> was celebrated as a holiday in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, the places which were distantly removed from Jerusalem<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and were not informed of the day on which Rosh Hashanah had fallen, would celebrate two days. Therefore, they...</i> would not take the lulav on this day because of the doubt involved."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.17","When the Temple was destroyed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even though the new moon was still sanctified according to the testimony of witnesses. (That practice continued several hundred years after the destruction of the Temple - <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 5:3.)</i>, the Sages forbade even the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> who had sanctified the new month to take the lulav on the Sabbath on the first day of Sukkot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the reasons mentioned in Halachah 13.</i>.<br>[This was instituted] because of the inhabitants of the distant settlements, who were not aware of when the new month had been declared. Thus, a uniform guideline was established, rather than having some take the lulav on the Sabbath and some not. [The guiding principle was] that the obligation [of taking the lulav] on the first day applies in all places<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the people in the distant communities could not take the lulav when the first day fell on the Sabbath because of the doubt involved</i>, and there is no longer a Temple to use as a point of distinction."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.18","At present, when everyone follows a fixed calendar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 5 of <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i>.</i>, the matter remains as it was, and the lulav is not taken on the Sabbath in the outlying territories or in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> even on the first day [of the festival]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> when the obligation to do so is from the Torah itself.</i>. [This applies] even though everyone knows the actual day of the month.<br>As explained<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in Halachah 13,</i>, the reason for the prohibition of taking the lulav on the Sabbath is a decree lest one carry it four cubits in the public domain."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.19","Whoever is obligated<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the note on Halachah 6:1.</i> to fulfill [the mitzvot of] shofar and sukkah is obligated to take the lulav. Whoever is not obligated regarding shofar and sukkah is not obligated to take the lulav<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the lulav, like the shofar and the sukkah, is a positive commandment whose observance is restricted to a specific time. Accordingly, women and slaves are under no obligation. (See Halachot 2:1 and 6:1.)</i>.<br>A child who knows how to shake [the lulav] is obligated regarding the lulav by Rabbinic law, in order to train him in the performance of mitzvot."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.20","It is a halachah conveyed by Moses from Mount Sinai<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as described in the following halachot.</p>
<p>Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i>, (<i>Sukkah</i> 43b) explain that the mitzvah of the willow branch was only performed by the priests for only they were allowed to approach the Temple altar where the branches were arranged. However, from halachah 22, it appears that the Rambam does not share this opinion.</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 44a, b also mentions that outside the Temple there was a custom of established in the time of the prophets requiring the taking of the willow by all Jews. (See also <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:16.)</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., a commandment that has the status of Torah law even though there is no explicit commandment to that effect in the Torah.</i> that - in addition to the willow of the lulav - another willow branch was taken in the Temple. A person does not fulfill his obligation with the willow branch in the lulav.<br>The minimum requirement [to fulfill this mitzvah] is one branch with one leaf."

<div class=""captioncell"">The Willow Branches Placed Around The Temple Altar</div>
</div>
How was this mitzvah performed?<br>On each of the seven days [of the festival], branches of willows were brought a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> from Motza, a small town slightly west of Jerusalem (<i>Sukkah</i> 45a).</i>nd stood upright near the altar with their tops bent over the altar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These willow branches were eleven cubits high and were placed on the base of the altar.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they would be taken by the people, as stated in the following halachah. Rabbenu Manoach maintains that the priests would take the willow branches and give them to the people because Israelites were not allowed to approach the altar, as above. However, he notes that Rav Yitzchak ibn Giat's description of the mitzvah could be interpreted to mean that the Israelites themselves were permitted to approach the altar on this occasion.</i>. When they would bring them and arrange them [near the altar,] a series of [shofar blasts] - <i>teki'ah, teru'ah,</i> and <i>teki'ah</i> - were sounded.<br>When the Sabbath fell in the midst of the festival, the willows would not be arranged [near the altar]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> on the Sabbath, since the mitzvah of lulav was negated on such an occasion (Halachah 13). Indeed, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 4:3), the Rambam writes that the reason the mitzvah of taking the willow on the Sabbath was negated was so that people would not extend the leniency and take the lulav as well.</i> unless the seventh day fell on the Sabbath. [On such an occasion,] the willows were arranged [near the altar]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the willows were taken as during the week. Though the mitzvah of lulav would not be performed on such an occasion, an exception was made regarding the willows, in order...</i>, to publicize the fact that [taking] them is a mitzvah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.22","How would they fulfill [this mitzvah on the Sabbath]?<br>They would bring [the branches] to the Temple on the Sabbath eve and place them in golden containers, so their leaves would not dry out. O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some commentaries explain that the golden vessels were used as an expression of respect for the mitzvah. However, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> explains that, in comparison to containers made of other metals, golden ones are more beneficial in preserving the willows' freshness.</i>n the following morning, they would be placed next to the altar and the people would take them in the same manner as they did each day.<br>Since the willow is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> reads: ""it is not explicitly [an obligation] from the Torah."" Accordingly, he and the other commentators debated whether the Rambam considers a halachah conveyed by Moses from Mt. Sinai as a Torah obligation or not. In <i>Hilchot Tum'at Meit</i> 2:10, the Rambam specifically states that a halachah conveyed by tradition has the power of Torah law.</i>, it is not taken on each of the seven days of the festival as a remembrance of the Temple. Rather, at present it is taken only on the seventh day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Hoshanah Rabbah.</i>.<br>What is done? One takes one<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> willow</i> branch or many branches in addition to the willow of the lulav, and hits the ground o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Zohar</i> mentions this practice</i>r a utensil with them two or three times. No blessing is recited, because this practice is a custom instituted by the prophets."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.23","On each day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in the Temple</i>, they would walk around the altar once, carrying their lulavim<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> notes that this recalls the miracle of the conquest of Jericho.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 43b mentions an opinion that states that the people would walk around the altar carrying the willow branch, but concludes as the Rambam does. (See also <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 664:4.)</i> in their hands, reciting: ""Please, God, save us. Please, God, grant us success"" [Psalms 118:25]. On the seventh day, they would walk around the altar seven times.<br>It has become universally accepted Jewish custom to place the ark in the center of the synagogue and walk around it each day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> once, and seven times on <i>Hoshanah Rabbah</i>.</i>, as they walked around the altar in remembrance of the Temple [service]."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.24","The following custom was observed in Jerusalem<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as an expression of the dearness with which the people regarded the mitzvah:</i>: A person would leave his house in the morning [carrying] his lulav in his hand. He would enter the synagogue with it in his hand; pray while it was in his hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even though one should not ordinarily hold any objects in one's hands while praying, lest one's concentration be distracted, since holding the lulav is a mitzvah dear to a Jew's heart, it will not become a distraction.</i>; go to visit the sick and comfort the mourners with it in his hand. When he entered the House of Study, he would send it home with his son or servant."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.25","During the time the lulav was taken on the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachot 13 and 14. At present, it is forbidden to carry the lulav on the Sabbath (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 558:2).</i>, a woman was allowed to receive the lulav from her son or her husband and return it to the water on the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This was not considered a violation of the Sabbath laws which prevent causing any agricultural growth. However, it was forbidden to add to the water or change it on the Sabbath because of the trouble involved.</i>. On the festival, a person might add to the water. On Chol Hamo'ed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> though there are certain restrictions against work</i>, one might change the water."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.26","It is forbidden to smell the myrtle in the lulav<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained in Chapter 6, Halachah 15, with regard to the <i>s'chach</i> of a sukkah: after it has been set aside for use as a mitzvah, it may not be used for mundane purposes throughout the holiday.</i>. Since it is useful only for smelling and it has been set aside for the performance of the mitzvah, it is forbidden to smell it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The prohibition applies even on the Sabbath, when the lulav is not taken (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 653:2).</i>. However, it is permitted to smell an etrog, because setting it aside for the mitzvah [prohibits it from being] eaten."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.27","It is forbidden to eat the etrog<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even if it has become unacceptable for use in performing the mitzvah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 665:1).</i> throughout the seventh day [of the festival]; since it was set aside for a portion of the day, it is set aside for the entire day. However, on the eighth day it is permitted to be eaten<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In contrast, the <i>s'chach</i> of the sukkah might not be used for a mundane purpose on the eighth day either (Chapter 6, Halachah 15). Rabbenu Manoach explains the difference, relating that - should one desire to eat - the sukkah must also be used <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> - the period between sunset and the appearance of three stars - while the lulav would not be taken during that time.</i>.<br>At present, when we celebrate [the festivals for] two days - even though the etrog is not taken on the eighth day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes the contrast between the mitzvot of lulav and of the sukkah, which, as mentioned in Chapter 6, Halachah 13, must be fulfilled on the eighth day of the festival. He differentiates between the two, noting that it is a mitzvah from the Torah to dwell in the sukkah for all seven days of the holiday. Therefore, because of the doubt, that mitzvah was also observed on the eighth day. In contrast, outside of Jerusalem there was never a mitzvah from the Torah to take the lulav for seven days. Hence, that mitzvah need not be observed on the eighth day.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds a further point. It is forbidden to carry the lulav for no purpose on the eighth day, the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. No such prohibition applies regarding the use of the sukkah.</i> - the etrog is forbidden on the eighth day, since it was forbidden on the eighth day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> advises amending the text to read ""on the seventh day."" In either case, the intent is the same - because it was forbidden by law on the seventh day, that prohibition was observed on the eighth day as well, because of the doubt involved.</i> during the time [the festivals] were celebrated for two days because of the doubt whether [the eighth day] was, in fact, the seventh.<br>When a person sets aside seven etrogim, [one for each] of the seven days [of the festival], each one of them can be used for the mitzvah on its day and eaten on the morrow."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.1","There are eight requirements in the making of <i>tefillin</i>. All of them are halachot transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Chapter 1, Halachah 3, the Rambam mentioned that there were ten requirements for <i>tefillin</i> that were communicated as ""halachot transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai."" The first two involve the actual composition of the <i>tefillin</i>. They, and the other laws involving that subject, were discussed in the first two chapters. Now the Rambam discusses the requirements involved in making the <i>tefillin</i>'s compartments and straps.</i> and, therefore, it is necessary to fulfill them all. If one deviates with regard to any of them, the [<i>tefillin</i>] are unacceptable. They are:<br/>
a) The <i>tefillin</i> must be square a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is a homiletic dimension to this requirement. Nothing is naturally square. Thus, this shape alludes to man's power of achievement. Wearing <i>tefillin</i> on our heads and opposite our hearts implies that we should exercise our powers of achievement when our minds and hearts are tied to God's mitzvot.</p>
<p>The base of the <i>tefillin</i> must also be square. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:39) states that this is also a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:59 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:181, which state that since the squareness of <i>tefillin</i> is a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai, the <i>tefillin</i> must remain square at all times. If over the course of time, their shape changes, they may no longer be used.</i>nd must be sewn closed in a square. [Both] diagonals<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> of the square on the top and the base of the <i>tefillin</i></i> must be equal, and thus all four angles will be equal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Each one being 90 degrees. See Halachot 2 and 4.</i>.<br/>
b) The leather of the head [<i>tefillin</i>] should have a <i>shin</i> embossed on both its right and left sides.<br/>
c) The passages should be wrapped in fabric<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachah 8.</i>.<br/>
d) A hair should be wound around that fabric. Afterwards, they should be placed in their compartment.<br/>
e) They should be sewn [closed] with the sinews [of an animal]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachot 9-10.</i>.<br/>
f) The leather compartment in which they are placed should have a place for the straps to pass through so that they can be moved through the [<i>tefillin</i>'s] handle.<br/>
g) The straps should be black<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachot 14.</i>.<br/>
h) The knot with which they are tied should be the renowned knot that is formed like a <i>dalet</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.2","How are the head <i>tefillin</i> made? We take a cubic wooden block<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This appears to be the Rambam's preference. It is not, however, an absolute requirement.</i>. [It need not, however, be a perfect cube]. If its height is [slightly] more or less than its width, it is of no consequence. We are required to take care only that its width and length are alike.<br>Three grooves are carved into it so that four projections will be made as depicted<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The accompanying diagram is based on a drawing by the Rambam himself, which has been copied in all printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i>. Leather is taken and soaked in water, and then, the mold is placed within it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> read, ""The leather is placed around the mold."" This version more accurately describes the process with which <i>tefillin</i> are actually made.</i>. The leather is inserted in between the grooves.<br>While [the leather] is still wet, it is plucked and squeezed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> with tweezers. The <i>Orchot Chayim</i> states that one must make the <i>shin</i> in this manner, and it is unacceptable to use a mold. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32), <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:65, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:193 all mention that though it is theoretically preferable to follow the <i>Orchot Chayim's</i> ruling, nevertheless, until recently, most <i>shinim</i> were made using a mold. At present, however, there are some manufacturers of <i>tefillin</i> who have reverted to the practice of making the <i>shin</i> with tweezers.</i> until the shape of a <i>shin</i> with three heads<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the usual form of the <i>shin</i>.</i> is formed on the right side of the <i>tefillin</i> as they will be worn, and the shape of a <i>shin</i> with four heads is formed on the left side of the <i>tefillin</i> as they will be worn."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.3","The leather is then left on the mold until it dries, and then it is removed.

<p>The width of this ""handle"" should be less than the width of the base of the <i>tefillin</i>, to distinguish it from the base and thus accentuate the base's squareness (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:177).</i>. It is called a <i>ma'aboret</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.4","How are the <i>tefillin</i> of the arm made?

<p><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:63 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:189 mention that the width and length of the base of the <i>tefillin</i> should be more than one fingerbreadth. Preferably, the width and length of the head <i>tefillin</i> should be two fingerbreadths.</i>, and place wet leather around it.<br>The leather is left on this mold until it has dried, and then it is removed. The four passages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which are written on a single piece of parchment</i> are deposited in the place left by the mold. A portion of the leather is folded over beneath them, and then they are sewn closed on all four corners<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachah 10.</i>. A piece of leather, like a handle, should be left for the straps [to be inserted]."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.5","What is the order of the passages? For the head <i>tefillah</i>, the final passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>, i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The order of the passages chosen by the Rambam - when read by a person facing the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i> - reflects their order in the Torah (<i>Menachot</i> 34b). Hence, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> is referred to as the final passage.</i>s placed in the first compartment on the right side of the person putting on the <i>tefillin</i>. <i>Shema</i> is placed next to it. <i>V'hayah ki y'viacha</i> is placed in the third compartment next to <i>Shema</i>, and <i>Kadesh Li</i> is placed in the fourth compartment, on the left side of the person putting on the <i>tefillin</i>.<br>Thus, a person who is facing the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i> will read them in the following order<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The diagram accompanying this halachah is based on a diagram drawn by the Rambam himself and included in all texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</p>
<p>Thus, the Rambam (and similarly, Rabbenu Tam and those who follow his opinion) considered that the order of the passages be calculated from the perspective of a person standing opposite the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i>. In contrast, there are other opinions (<i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> and the Ra'avad) who maintain that the order of the passages should be calculated from the perspective of the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i>. (This produces two further perspectives regarding the order of the <i>tefillin</i>. The <i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> follows the same order as the Rambam except that <i>V'hoyoh im Shamoa</i>, is placed in the first compartment on the left side of the person putting on the <i>tefillin</i>, not on the right side. Similarly, the Ra'avad shares Rabbenu Tam's view, but reverses the sides.)</i>. If their order is altered, they are not acceptable."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.6","[The passages for] the arm <i>tefillin</i> are written on four columns<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> each passage being written on a separate column</i> on a single piece of parchment like a Torah scroll<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the parchment is rolled closed.</i>, according to the order in which these passages are found in the Torah, in the following manner:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The diagram accompanying this halachah is based on a diagram drawn by the Rambam himself and included in all texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i><br>If they were written on four separate pieces of parchment and placed in the same compartment, one fulfills one's obligation.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.7","When the passages - both of the head and the arm <i>tefillin</i> - are rolled closed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to be inserted into their compartments.</i>, they should be rolled from the end to the beginning, so that were the passage to be rolled open, it would be possible to read each portion from the beginning to the end."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.8","Before the passages are placed in their compartments, they should be wrapped in a fabric<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The present custom is to use a piece of parchment (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:44). Although the Rambam considers this requirement to be a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai, the Ashkenazic authorities do not agree. Accordingly, they maintain that, after the fact, if the passages are not wrapped in this parchment, the <i>tefillin</i> may still be used (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:68; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:205).</p>
<p>The difference between the Rambam and the Ashkenazic authorities depends on their interpretation of a passage from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megilah</i>, Chapter 1). This difference in interpretation is also reflected in the laws regarding correcting a torn Torah scroll. See Chapter 9, Halachah 15.</i>, and hair should be wound around them.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.10","When the <i>tefillin</i> are sewn closed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> interprets this to be an allusion to the twelve tribes of Israel.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If the base of the <i>tefillin</i> is made from a separate piece of leather from the compartments, the stitches must also be connected to the edges of the skin covering the compartments (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:77; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:228).</i>, they should be sewn as a square. It is a widely accepted practice for there to be three stitches on each side, so that there will be twelve stitches in all. This applies for both the arm <i>tefillin</i> and the head <i>tefillin</i>. If, however, one made ten or fourteen stitches, there is no difficulty.<br>For each of the stitches, the thread<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or threads</i> must pass through from both sides."

Torah Study 3.3,"None of the other mitzvot can be equated to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah can be equated to all the mitzvot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1 as the source for this statement. That Mishnah lists a number of mitzvot whose ""benefits are enjoyed in this world, though the principle [reward] remains for the world to come"" and concludes ""the study of Torah is equivalent to them all.""</p>
<p>However, the <i>Lev Shlomo</i> notes that the antecedents of the phrase ""them all"" are the various mitzvot which are mentioned previously in the mishnah and not ""all the mitzvot of the Torah."" Hence, he refers to the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1), which states: ""All the mitzvot of the Torah are not worth one word of the Torah.""</i>, because study leads to deed.

Thus, the Rambam tells him that rather than ignore Torah study and devote himself to the performance of good deeds alone, he should study.</p>
<p>This chapter centers around the principle that Torah study is the highest rung a person can reach. Accordingly, the advice in this and the following halachah applies to even a person who has established a basis of Torah knowledge. It teaches him to seek personal fulfillment in study rather than in deed. Similarly, it advises us that the most propitious way to use each moment of spare time is to devote these moments to Torah study.</i> in all cases."
Torah Study 3.4,"[The following rules apply] when a person is confronted with the performance of a mitzvah and the study of Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the performance of the mitzvah would cause him to interrupt his studies.</i>: If the mitzvah can be performed by another individual, he should not interrupt his studies.

<p><i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> <i>ibid.</i>, offers two possible resolutions to this apparent contradiction:<br/>
a) A person who never studied at all is judged first regarding Torah study. However, one who studied, but did not establish fixed times for study is judged first regarding his business affairs;<br/>
b) Even though the first question that the soul is asked centers on his business affairs, the first retribution he will receive will result from his neglect of Torah study.</i>.<br>Accordingly, our Sages would say: ""A person should always occupy himself in Torah study, whether for God's sake or even if not for God's sake<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam elaborates further on the definition of these concepts in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 10:4-5:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">The Sages of the previous generations declared: Should one say: ""I will study Torah in order that I become wealthy, in order that I be called a Rabbi, or in order that I receive reward in the world to come?"" The Torah teaches [Deuteronomy 11:13]: ""[If you are careful to observe My commandments...] to love God;"" [implying] that all that you do should be done only out of love.<br/>
The Sages also said: [Psalms 112:1 instructs:] ""Desire His commandments greatly."" [Desire His commandments] and not the reward [that comes from] His commandments...<br/>
Anyone who occupies himself with the Torah in order to receive reward or in order to protect himself from retribution is considered as one who is not occupied for God's sake.<br/>
[In contrast,] anyone who occupies himself with it, not because of fear, nor to receive a reward, but rather because of his love for the Lord of the entire earth, Who commanded it, is one who occupies himself for God's sake.</i>, for from [the study of Torah which] is not carried out for God's sake will come [the study of Torah which] is carried out for God's sake."
Torah Study 3.6,"A person whose heart inspires him to fulfill this mitzvah in a fitting manner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 8, the Rambam's statements imply that there are two aspects of Torah study:<br/>
a) The obligation to study Torah, which is incumbent on every individual: the establishment of fixed times for Torah study (Chapter 1, Halachah 8).<br/>
b) A commitment to devote oneself to Torah study that has no limitations.</p>
<p>The first aspect reflects a commitment that takes into consideration man's perspective, and, hence, is limited in scope. However, when a person views the Torah from God's perspective and appreciates its infinite nature, he will be inspired to make an unbounded commitment to Torah study.

<p>It is difficult to understand why the Rambam emphasizes the aspect of reward, when in the previous halachah he stressed how one should not study Torah for ulterior motives. Included in the latter is also the reward in the world to come.</i>, and that reward is commensurate with the difficulty [invested]."
Torah Study 3.7,"Perhaps, one will say: ""[I will interrupt my studies] until after I gather money, and then I will return and study, [I will interrupt my studies] until after I buy what I need, and then, when I can divert my attention from my business, I will return and study<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note Chapter 1, Halachah 5, which counsels studying Torah before marriage, so the yoke of financial responsibility will not interfere with one's studies.</i>.""

<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam explains that any of the species which are stolen may not be used for the mitzvah, because a sin may not serve as the medium with which a mitzvah will be performed (מצוה הבאה בעבירה). (See also <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:7; <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach</i> 5:7, 5:9.)</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 29b-30a mentions this reason, but also a second explanation: because, as stated in Halachah 10, on the first day of the festival a person must own the four species he uses for the mitzvah.

it is not acceptable.<br>If one of them belonged to an idolater<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but was not worshiped itself (Rabbenu Manoach); i.e., it grew in a garden of the temple of an idol.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.4","The natural pattern of growth of the leaves of the lulav is that two grow in pairs, connected at their back.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 645:3) quotes the Rambam's opinion, while the Ramah favors that of Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i>.</i>"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.5","A myrtle branch whose top is cut off is acceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the myrtle branch is covered by its leaves, the fact that its top is cut off is not noticeable (Rabbenu Manoach).</p>
<p>Though the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:2) states that such a myrtle is unacceptable, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 34b) states that the halachah follows Rabbi Tarfon, whose opinion is quoted by the Rambam in this halachah.</p>
<p>In his commentary on this halachah, the Ra'avad states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a number of years, the spirit of prophecy has been present in our chamber of study, and we have determined that [such a myrtle] is not acceptable.</p>

<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 646:10) quotes the Rambam's opinion. However, the Ramah writes that it is proper to adhere to the Ra'avad's view if possible. However, he quotes Rabbenu Nissim, who maintains that the top of a myrtle is only considered to be ""cut off"" when the top of the branch is broken.

(See also Sukkah 36a.)</i>.<br>In places where the etrogim grow naturally with a slight black tinge, it is kosher.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.9","All the species which we categorized as unacceptable because of the blemishes we described<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 36b relates that Rabbi Chanina would eat from an etrog and then use it for the mitzvah. Though an etrog which is lacking even the slightest amount of its substance may not be used (Halachah 7), he still fulfilled his obligation with it. From this incident, our Sages concluded that, on the later days, even such an etrog is kosher.</p>
<p>According to the Rambam's opinion, the same applies to all other physical blemishes on the species. Since there is no greater blemish than an etrog which is bitten into, none of the requirements for ""beauty"" must be observed on the later days.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 29b and Rabbenu Asher maintain that this leniency applies only to etrogim which are lacking in substance. All the species which were disqualified because they are not ""beautiful"" may not be used on the later days as well. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 649:5 quotes the Rambam, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (649:17) and the <i>Taz</i> (649:9) quote the other view.</i> or because they were stolen or taken by force are [disqualified for use] only on the first day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, there are two explanations why a stolen lulav may not be used on the first day:</p>
<p>a) a sin may not serve as the medium with which a mitzvah will be performed (מצוה הבאה בעבירה);</p>
<p>b) as stated in Halachah 10, on the first day of the festival a person must own the four species he uses for the mitzvah.</p>
<p>The commentaries explain that the Rambam follows the latter rationale. However, those who follow the first opinion (the Ra'avad, the Ramban, Rabbenu Asher) forbid the use of stolen species on the later days as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) quotes the Rambam, while the Ramah follows the other view.</p>
<p>[Though the above explanation is frequently used, it is difficult to accept. First, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam mentions the reason of מצוה הבאה בעבירה. Also, in <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:7 and in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach</i> 5:7 and 5:9, he forbids the use of stolen articles for the performance of a commandment. In addition, he has not yet mentioned the halachah requiring one to own the lulav used on the first day.</p>
<p>The <i>Taz</i> (649:15) clarifies the matter slightly further by explaining that since taking the lulav on the second day is only a Rabbinic commandment, using a stolen lulav is allowed even though it is a מצוה הבאה בעבירה.]</i>.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10","On the first day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It appears from the Rambam's statements that even in Jerusalem, where Torah law requires that the mitzvah be fulfilled for all seven days of the festival, the obligation to own the lulav applies only on the first day.</i>, a person cannot fulfill his obligation by using a lulav that belongs to a colleague and was borrowed from him, unless the latter gives it to him as a present<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though there are certain restrictions against the transfer of property on a holiday, it is permitted to give a colleague a present (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 3:11).</i>.<br>If [the owner of the lulav] gives it to him as a present on the condition that he return it, he may fulfill his obligation with it and return it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are authorities who require that the owner specifically state that he is giving the lulav to his colleague on the condition that the latter return it. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 658:5) states that even if the owner gives a colleague a lulav without making such a statement, it is assumed that the lulav was given subject to this condition.</i>, because a present given on condition that it be returned is considered a present. If he does not return it, he does not fulfill his obligation, because it is as though it were stolen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., by failing to fulfill the condition under which the present was given, the recipient nullifies the legal transfer of ownership. Thus, although he was in physical possession of the article, it did not belong to him. Hence, it is considered to be stolen and, thus, not eligible to be used for the mitzvah (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.).</i>.<br>[On the first day,] a lulav should not be given to a minor<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The definition of the term ""minor"" in this context has been the subject of debate among the Rabbis. From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he includes all minors in this category. However, Rabbenu Nissim writes that a child of six or seven can transfer property and, hence, his return of the lulav is valid.</p>
<p>Support for Rabbenu Nissim's position is brought from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:10), which relates that Rav Nachman bar Ya'akov gave his etrog as a present to his son and told him: ""When you take possession of it and fulfill the mitzvah, return it to me."" Nevertheless, the passage does not serve as conclusive proof, because the possibility exists that his son had already reached majority. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 6) follows the Rambam's view.</i>, since, according to Torah law, a minor can acquire articles but cannot transfer them to others<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The transfer of the ownership of an article requires a conscious decision. Torah law maintains that a child lacks intellectual maturity (דעת), and thus is incapable of making such a decision.</i>. Thus, [the minor's] return of the article is not considered to be a return [from a legal perspective].<br>The above applies to the lulav and to each of the other species of the four taken with it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The verse quoted above includes all the four species, and not only the lulav. Therefore...</i>. If one of them was borrowed, the person does not fulfill his obligation on the first day of the festival."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.11","When partners purchase a lulav or etrog together, neither is<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> considered to be the owner of the species in its entirety. Therefore, neither is...</i> able to fulfill his obligation with it on the first [day of the festival] unless his colleague gives him his portion as a present<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The principles mentioned in the previous halachah regarding giving a lulav as a present also apply to giving a share of it as a present.</p>
<p>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions a very frequent application of this concept: a lulav and etrog purchased by a synagogue for the use of all of its members. He quotes the Rashba, who explains that since the etrog was purchased with the intent that it be used by each member of that community, implicit in their agreement is that, on the first day, it will belong to each individual entirely at the time he uses it to fulfill the mitzvah.</p>
<p>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 648:7) quotes this statement as halachah. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 648:10 raises questions concerning it and suggests that each member of the community should grant his colleague his share as a present.</i>.<br>Should brothers purchase etrogim from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet: If one of them takes an etrog with the intent of fulfilling his obligation, [the following rules apply:] If he could eat it without the other brothers objecting<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> it is considered to be his own. Hence,...</i>, he has fulfilled his obligation. If they would object, he does not fulfill his obligation until they give him their share [in the etrog] as a present.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></p>
<p>The above principles apply only when the funds of the estate were used to purchase a number of etrogim. Since many fruits of the same species were purchased with the money from the estate, it is possible that the other brothers will not object to one brother's taking an etrog for his own use. However, if the money of the estate was used to buy a number of different species of fruit - e.g.,...</i><br>If one brother bought an etrog and another a quince, or together they bought an etrog, a pomegranate, and a quince from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet, one cannot fulfill one's obligation with the etrog until the others give him their share [in it] as a present, even though they would not object to his [use of it]."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.12","Even though it is a mitzvah to rejoice on all the festivals<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as Deuteronomy 16:14 teaches: ""And you shall rejoice on your festivals."" Though that verse is mentioned with regard to Sukkot, Deuteronomy 16:11 states with regard to Shavuot: ""and you shall rejoice before God,"" and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4b explains that an analogy is established to include Pesach as well.</i>, there was an additional celebration in the Temple on the festival of Sukkot, as [Leviticus 23:40] commands: ""And you shall rejoice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i> before God, your Lord, for seven days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although this verse is used to derive the requirement of taking the lulav in Jerusalem for each of the seven days of the festival (Chapter 7, Halachah 13), its simple meaning remains.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this charge is not considered to be an independent commandment, but rather an extension (and an intensification) of the mitzvah of celebrating on the festivals. Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes ""to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>.""</p>
<p>This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another. For this reason, weddings are not held during the festivals so that the wedding celebrations should not clash with those of the festival.</p>
<p>Thus, were one to consider the celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> as associated with the water offering, one might ask why the Sages instituted such a celebration which might appear to overshadow the celebration of the festival itself. However, the above explanation resolves this difficulty as well, for as stated above, the <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> celebration is an extension of the festival celebrations and not an independent matter. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, ibid.)</i>.""<br>What was done? On the eve of the first day of the festival, they would set up a place in the Temple<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in the open courtyard before the entrance to the Temple courtyard proper. This was called <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> - the women's courtyard - because in contrast to the Temple courtyard, women were allowed to enter the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> even when they were not offering sacrifices. The Rambam describes the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> in <i>Hilchot Beit Habechirah</i> 5:7.</i> where women [could watch] from above, and men from below, so they would not intermingle with each other.<br>The celebration would begin on the night after the first day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since, as explained in the following halachah, the celebration was not held on the first night of the festival.</i>. Similarly, on each day of Chol Hamo'ed, after offering the daily afternoon sacrifice, they would begin to celebrate for the rest of the day and throughout the night."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.13","What was the nature of this celebration?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1-2) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever has not seen <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> has never seen rejoicing in his life!...</p>
<p>There were golden candelabras....There was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illuminated with the light of <i>Beit Hasho'evah</i>.</p>
<p>The pious and men of stature would dance before them with torches of fire in their hands and recite songs of praise. The Levites would play the harps, lutes, cymbals, and all other types of instruments on the steps...leading down from the Israelites' courtyard.</i> The flute would be sounded and songs played on the harp, lute, and cymbals. [In addition,] each person would play on the instrument which he knew. Those who could sing, would sing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the quote from the Mishnah above.</i>. They would dance and clap their hands, letting loose and whistling, each individual in the manner which he knew. Words of song and praise were recited.<br>This celebration does not supersede either the Sabbath or the festival [prohibitions]."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.14","It is a great mitzvah to maximize this celebration<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the experience of genuine Torah happiness is a fundamental and necessary element of our service of God, as explained in the following halachah.</i>. The common people and anyone who desired would not perform [in these celebrations]; only the greatest of Israel's wise men: the <i>Rashei Yeshivot</i>, the members of the high court, the pious, the elders, and the men of stature. T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for it was only their celebration that could inspire the people with spiritual feeling.</i>hey were those who would dance, clap their hands, sing, and rejoice in the Temple on the days of the festival of Sukkot. However, the entire people - the men and the women - would come to see and hear."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.15","The happiness with which a person should rejoice in the fulfillment of the mitzvot and the love of God who commanded them is a great service<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> By mentioning this concept at the conclusion - but as part - of the these halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the celebration of the festivals is not just an isolated experience, but rather is intended to influence the totality of our service of God. The rejoicing of the festival of Sukkot enables us to appreciate true happiness in all aspects of our Torah service.</i>. Whoever holds himself back from this rejoicing is worthy of retribution, as [Deuteronomy 28:47] states: ""...because you did not serve God, your Lord, with happiness and a glad heart.""<br>Whoever holds himself proud, giving himself honor, and acts haughtily in such situations is a sinner and a fool<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for he is concerned with himself, rather than with God.</i>. Concerning this, Solomon warned [Proverbs 28:10]: ""Do not seek glory before the King.""<br>[In contrast,] anyone who lowers himself and thinks lightly of his person in these situations<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> transcending his self-consciousness and committing himself to God totally, without any restrictions</i> is [truly] a great person, worthy of honor, who serves God out of love<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, Chapter 10.</i>. Thus, David, King of Israel, declared [II Samuel 6:22]: ""I will hold myself even more lightly esteemed than this and be humble in my eyes,"" because there is no greatness or honor other than celebrating before God, as [II Samuel 6:16] states: ""King David was dancing wildly and whistling before God."""
Fasts 3.1,"[We should adhere to the following procedure when] no rain at all has descended from the beginning of the rainy season onward:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 6a relates that the rainy season in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> begins in the month of Marcheshvan. The third of the month is considered to be the earliest time rain can be expected to descend.</p>
<p>In other lands, such fasts should be held when, ע""ל, they are necessary according to the local needs and climate (Halachah 10; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575:9).</i> If the seventeenth of Marcheshvan arrives and no rains have descended, the Torah scholars should begin to fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and repent. Nevertheless, the situation is not serious enough to alarm the people at large.</i>, [starting on] a Monday [and continuing on] the [following] Thursday, and the [following] Monday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These fasts begin at dawn; work, anointing oneself, wearing shoes, and sexual relations are permitted.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:1) emphasizes that these fasts are considered individual fasts and not communal fasts.</i>. All students [of the Torah] are fit to accept these [fasts] upon themselves."
Fasts 3.2,"If Rosh Chodesh Kislev arrives without the rains having descended<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The drought is considered serious enough to warrant that</i>, the court should decree three communal fasts, [starting on] a Monday, [and continuing on] the [following] Thursday, and the [following] Monday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 5, when necessary the court ordains a series of three fasts to evoke Divine favor.</i>.

Fasts 3.3,"If these [fasts] pass without [their prayers] being answered<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> By choosing this wording (quoted from <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:6), the Rambam teaches us a lesson in the service of God. It could have said, ""If these fasts pass without rain having descended."" The Rambam and the Mishnah, however, want to emphasize that the ultimate reason why rain descends or does not descend is not dependent on natural factors, but rather on God's mercies.</i>, the court should decree an additional three communal fasts. On these fasts, we eat and drink while it is still day [on the day before the fast], as on the fast of Yom Kippur<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., as on Yom Kippur, we are forbidden to eat and drink after sunset. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 575:2, however, explains that unlike Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Esor</i> 1:6), there is no obligation to begin the fast before sunset.</i>.<br>The men serving in the [weekly] priestly watch should fast for part of the day, but should not complete the fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest they become weak and be unable to serve in the Temple when called.</i>.

Fasts 3.4,"On these three fasts, all people are forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam mentions in Chapter 1, Halachah 4, all the fasts mentioned in this text are Rabbinic in origin. The only fast mentioned in the Torah is Yom Kippur. Accordingly, when the Sages instituted communal fasts, they used Yom Kippur as a paradigm. Therefore, just as it is forbidden to perform work, wash, anoint oneself, engage in sexual relations, or wear shoes on that holy day, these activities were also forbidden on other fast days.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on fast days other than Yom Kippur, certain leniencies were instituted, and these restrictions were not enforced to the same degree as on Yom Kippur.</i> to perform work during the day, but they are permitted during the [previous] night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit, ibid.</i>, continues using exegesis to show that, in contrast to Shavuot, working on the night of a fast day is permitted.</i>. It is forbidden for a person to wash his entire body in hot water, but one may wash one's face, hands, and feet<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even in hot water (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i>. For this reason, the bathhouses are closed.<br>It is forbidden to anoint oneself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the sake of pleasure.</i>. One may, however, do so to remove filth. Sexual relations are forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This applies even on the night of a woman's ritual immersion (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:8).</i>, as is wearing shoes in a city. One may, however, wear shoes on a journey. We pray in the synagogues<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As opposed to the following sequence of fasts, whose prayer services are held in the streets of the city, as explained in Chapter 4.</i>, cry out [to God], and make supplications as is customary on all fasts."
Fasts 3.7,"There are additional dimensions [of severity] to these [fasts]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The first four points mentioned in this halachah are described at length in Chapter 4.</i>: it is on these alone that we sound the trumpets, pray in the street of the city<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 4, Halachah 1</i>, call on an elder to admonish the people [and motivate] them to repent from their [evil] ways, add six blessings in the morning<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 4, Halachot 7-14</i> and afternoon prayers - thus, we recite twenty-four blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> More precisely 25. The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2), which refers to the era before the nineteenth blessing was added to the daily <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2:1.)</i>, and close the stores.<br>On Mondays, the doors of the stores<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:4), the Ramah, and other commentaries, it appears that the leniencies mentioned here refer only to stores that sell food, but not those that carry other merchandise.</i> are left slightly ajar towards evening and they may be opened [for business]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to allow people to purchase food for the evening meal. There are, however, certain restrictions; for example, the products in the store may not be taken out to the store's display area (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:6).</i>. On Thursdays, [the stores] may be opened the entire day [to allow people to purchase food] in honor of the Sabbath. If a store has two entrances, one entrance should be opened and the other closed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it appears that this restriction applies on Mondays as well as on Thursdays.</i>. If the store has a display area in front of it, it may be opened in the normal manner on a Thursday without concern [for the above restriction]."
Fasts 3.8,"If these [fasts] pass without [their prayers] being answered<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> no other communal fasts are ordained, as explained in the following halachah. The fact that no other fasts are called does not mean that the community may return to their ordinary pattern of conduct. Quite the contrary: the period is regarded as one of Divine disfavor. Hence,</i>, we should minimize our commercial activity, construction projects associated with joy - e.g., those involving decorative patterns on the ceilings and walls<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 1:7), the Rambam states that this refers to ornate buildings erected by the wealthy. There is, however, no restriction on ordinary building projects necessary for one's everyday purposes.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:7) describes the prohibition as applying to ""buildings of joy."" The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:18 (based on the <i>Tur</i>) explains that this refers to all buildings that are unnecessary and are constructed for beauty and comfort.</i>, plantings associated with joy - e.g., that of myrtle trees<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that this refers to spice and flower gardens planted for pleasure. One may, however, plant orchards for the purpose of growing fruit. There are no restrictions on such activity.</i>, and the erection of tents.<br>We also minimize betrothals and marriages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575) interprets this to mean that a person who has fulfilled the mitzvah of fathering children should not become betrothed or marry at all.</i>, unless one has not fulfilled the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying. Whoever has fulfilled this mitzvah is forbidden to engage in sexual relations in a year of famine<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a derives this concept from Genesis 41:50, which states that Joseph's children were born before the famine. One can infer that during the famine he did not engage in relations.</p>
<p>This restriction was instituted because it is proper to reduce our indulgence in pleasure in a time of communal distress.</i>.<br>We also reduce the exchange of greetings, and the Torah sages should not exchange greetings at all. Rather, [they should conduct themselves as people] who have been rebuffed and ostracized by God<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A person under a ban of ostracism is forbidden to greet others or to return greetings. Hence the above prohibition.</p>
<p><i>Ta'anit</i> 14b states that it is proper to cover one's head with a cloak as mourners do. Nevertheless, neither the Rambam nor the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes this obligation (perhaps because even mourners did not generally observe this custom after the Talmudic era).</i>. When a common person greets them, they may return the greeting in a weak and concerned tone."
Fasts 3.9,"The Torah scholars alone continue to fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries do not mention whether it is preferable that all the students of the Torah join in these fasts, as was stated in Halachah 1. One might presume, however, that they should. Indeed, the entire community should have been required to observe these fasts, and it is only because the Rabbis thought that this would be too difficult for them that they were released from this obligation.</i>, [beginning on the next] Monday, [and continuing on the following] Thursday and Monday [in this manner] until the month of Nisan<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:7 states that these fasts should continue ""until Nisan passes."" In the Jerusalem Talmud's explanation of this Mishnah, it is explained that this refers to Nisan</i> - as determined in relation to the spring season - passes. This is not, however, required of the community. No more than these thirteen communal fasts are decreed because of a lack of rainfall<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 14b considered thirteen fasts as the maximum a community should be required to undertake for this reason. More fasts would be considered an excessive burden. (Significantly, according to Kabbalah, the number thirteen is identified with God's attributes of mercy.)</p>
<p>As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4, this limit applies only regarding fasts decreed because of a lack of rain. When communal fasts are decreed because of other distressing circumstances, we should continue fasting until our prayers are answered.</i>.<br>When these individuals fast until Nisan passes, they are allowed to eat at night and are allowed to perform work, to wash, to anoint themselves, to engage in sexual relations, and to wear shoes as on other fast days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These restrictions apply only on Yom Kippur, Tish'ah B'Av, and the latter ten fasts decreed because of a lack of rain.</i>. They do not fast on Rashei Chodashim, nor on Purim.<br>After the month of Nisan, as determined in relation to the spring season, passes - i.e<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> one month after the spring season begins</i>., when the sun enters the sign of the bull<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is at the beginning of the secular month of May.</i> - they should cease fasting. Since no rain has descended from the beginning of the year, rain in this season would be a sign of a curse."
Human Dispositions 6.1,"It is natural for a man's character and actions<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam emphasizes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8), man's ethical makeup is a combination of character and action.</i> to be influenced by his friends and associates and for him to follow the local norms of behavior. Therefore<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This sociological truism implies the following course of action.</i>, he should associate with the righteous and be constantly in the company of the wise, so as to learn from their deeds<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Halachah 2, the Rambam states that it is a mitzvah to associate with the righteous, while here he describes the need for such association as morally compelling. Note our commentary to that halachah.</i>. Conversely, he should keep away from the wicked who walk in darkness, so as not to learn from their deeds.<br>This is [implied by] Solomon's statement (Proverbs 13:20 : ""He who walks with the wise will become wise<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezar</i> (Chapter 25) explains this verse with an analogy of a person who spends time in a perfumery. Some of the pleasant fragrance attaches itself to him, even though he does not purchase anything.</i>, while one who associates with fools will suffer."" Similarly, [Psalms 1:1] states: ""Happy is the man who has not followed the advice of the wicked<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The verse from Proverbs supports the previously stated concept that a person is influenced by his environment. The verse from Psalms introduces the concept which follows; that bad company should be avoided.</p>
<p>A person who lives in a place where the norms of behavior are evil and the inhabitants do not follow the straight path should move to a place where the people are righteous - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXIII, states that this restriction does not apply to a person who settles in a community for the expressed purpose of spreading Torah. He need not worry about being influenced by his surroundings, because, to borrow a concept from <i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Chapter 69, out of context, ""one who is preoccupied with giving will not receive.""</i>.""<br>A person who lives in a place where the norms of behavior are evil and the inhabitants do not follow the straight path should move to a place where the people are righteous and follow the ways of the good.<br>If all the places with which he is familiar and of which he hears reports follow improper paths, as in our times, or if he is unable to move to a place where the patterns of behavior are proper, because of [the presence of] bands of raiding troops, or for health reasons<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam apparently does not suggest risking one's life to make such a move. However, note the passage from <i>Iggeret HaShmad</i> quoted below.</i>, he should remain alone in seclusion as [Eichah 3:28] states: ""Let him sit alone and be silent.""<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>f they are wicked and sinful and do not allow him to reside there unless he mingle with them and follow their evil behavior, he should go out to caves, thickets, and deserts [rather than] follow the paths of sinners as [Jeremiah 9:1] states: ""Who will give me a lodging place for wayfarers, in the desert."""
Human Dispositions 6.2,"It is a positive commandment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 6) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 434) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</p>
<p>In Halachah 1, the Rambam described the association with the wise as a moral imperative and, here, he states that it is a Torah commandment. We saw a similar pattern in Chapter 1. First, he outlined his theory of the middle path of behavior as the optimal moral position. Only afterwards, did he equate it with the commandment to ""walk in His ways.""</p>
<p>This approach demonstrates that the Torah does not impose a Divine Will upon man which he cannot grasp or understand. Rather, it reflects rules and principles that can be conceived by human thought and explained in terms of human nature. Thus, the workings of the Halachah can be seen as having been instituted as an organic part of the makeup of the world at large and man in particular. (See the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 48.)</i> to cleave unto the wise and their disciples in order to learn from their deeds as [Deuteronomy 10:20] states: ""and you will cling to Him.""<br>O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>ur Sages [questioned the nature of this command for] is it possible for man to cling to the Divine Presence?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since He transcends the reaches of our emotions and intellect, the commandment cannot be interpreted literally.</i> They [resolved the difficulty,] explaining this commandment to mean: Cleave unto the wise and their disciples.<br>Therefore<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., implied by ""cleaving"" is that</i>, one should try to marry the daughter of a Torah Sage and marry his daughter to a Torah Sage, eat and drink with Sages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 64a states: ""Anyone who partakes of a meal at which a Torah Sage is present is considered like one who has benefited from the radiance of the Divine Presence.""</i>, do business on behalf of Sages, and associate with them in all possible ways as [Deuteronomy 11:22] states: ""to cling to Him.""<br>S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>imilarly, our Sages have directed [us], saying: ""Sit in the dust of their feet and drink in their words thirstily."""

<p>Each of the clauses in these two verses is halachically significant. The first verse informs us that hatred of a fellow Jew is prohibited (Halachah 5). Then, it explains how one should respond if negative feelings towards a colleague arise (Halachah 6, here). Afterwards, it teaches that one's negative feelings must be expressed in a manner that does not embarrass one's fellow Jew (Halachah 8). Thus, the verse can be rendered: Do not bear hate in your heart, instead, inform your fellow Jew of your complaint, but do so in a manner that is not sinful. (Note the Ramban's commentary on the verse.)</p>
<p>The second verse teaches that vengeance or bearing a grudge is forbidden (Chapter 7, Halachot 7-8) and then, concludes with a positive statement obligating us to love our fellow Jew (Halachah 3).</i>.""<br>If, afterwards, [the person who committed the wrong] asks [his colleague] to forgive him, he must do so.

<p>The previous halachah dealt with this concept in terms of our interpersonal relationships. Our halachah deals with this concept within the context of a person's relationship with God. <i>Pesachim</i> 113a teaches we must hate a sinner. As a preventive measure, the Torah offers us an alternative, admonishing him, which hopefully will cause him to correct his behavior and thus, do away with the need for such hatred (<i>Sefer Yeraim</i>).</p>

However, note the latter portion of the following Halachah.</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (608:3) states that we are only required to administer a rebuke privately for a sin committed in private. If a person sees a colleague commit a sin in public, he should immediately rebuke him to prevent <i>chillul HaShem</i>.</i>. He should speak to him patiently and gently, informing him that he is only making these statements for his colleague's own welfare<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and has no intention of causing him harm, but wishes, instead,</i>, to allow him to merit the life of the world to come.<br>If he<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the colleague who acts wrongly</i> accepts [the rebuke], it is good; if not, he should rebuke him a second and third time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam quotes the <i>Sifra</i> which mentions repeating a rebuke four or five times. <i>Bava Metzia</i> 31b states one must rebuke a colleague even one hundred times.</i>. Indeed, one is obligated to rebuke a colleague who does wrong until the latter strikes him and tells him: ""I will not listen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Shivitat Esor</i> 1:7) states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Women who eat and drink until darkness [on the eve of Yom Kippur, because] they do not know we are commanded to add from the weekday to the holy [day] should not be admonished, lest they [continue] doing so consciously... It is better to allow them to remain unaware [of this transgression than risk] their willful violation of it.<br/>
The same applies concerning similar cases.</p>
<p>Commenting on this law, the Ramah (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that a person should not rebuke a colleague for the inadvertent transgression of a Torah law if he knows that the transgressor will not listen. However, this only applies regarding instances like the obligation to add to the Yom Kippur fast which are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah.</i>.""<br>Whoever has the possibility of rebuking [sinners] and fails to do so is considered responsible for that sin, for he had the opportunity to rebuke the [sinners]."
Human Dispositions 6.8,"At first<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as mentioned in the previous halachah</i>, a person who admonishes a colleague should not speak to him harshly until he becomes embarrassed as [Leviticus 19:17] states: ""[You should]... not bear a sin because of him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., from this verse, we can derive that embarrassing a colleague is a sin.</i>."" This is what our Sages said: Should you rebuke him to the point that his face changes [color]? The Torah states:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in the second half of the verse requiring us to rebuke a colleague.</i> ""[You should]... not bear a sin because of him.""<br>From this, [we learn that] it is forbidden for a person to embarrass a [fellow] Jew<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even in private</p>
<p>The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that when a person feels that a colleague wronged him, he should admonish the latter gently. If the person admonished does not respond, he may speak to him in harsher terms and even embarrass him in private. However, under no circumstances may he embarrass him publicly for his own personal reasons. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (156:8) and other commentaries disagree with this view and forbid embarrassing a colleague for personal reasons whether privately or publicly.</i>. How much more so [is it forbidden to embarrass him] in public. Even though a person who embarrasses a colleague is not [liable for] lashes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The minimum punishment for transgressing a Torah commandment.</i> on account of him, it is a great sin. Our Sages said:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avot</i> 3:14</i> ""A person who embarrasses a colleague in public does not have a share in the world to come.""<br>Therefore, a person should be careful not to embarrass a colleague - whether of great or lesser stature - in public, and not to call him a name which embarrasses him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) also states that one's share in the world to come is withheld because of this transgression.</i> or to relate a matter that brings him shame in his presence.<br>When does the above<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> prohibition against admonishing a person in public</i> apply? In regard to matters between one man and another. However, in regard to spiritual matters, if [a transgressor] does not repent [after being admonished] in private, he may be put to shame in public and his sin may be publicized. He may be subjected to abuse, scorn, and curses until he repents, as was the practice of all the prophets of Israel."
Human Dispositions 6.9,"It is pious behavior if a person who was wronged by a colleague would rather not admonish him or mention the matter at all because the person who wronged him was very boorish or because he was mentally disturbed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's words appear to indicate that if the person who committed the wrong was sophisticated enough to learn from the rebuke, he should be admonished so that he will develop his character.

Human Dispositions 6.10,"A person is obligated to show great care for orphans and widows because their spirits are very low and their feelings are depressed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These people tend to be oversensitive and the smallest harshness or slight might cause them pain and thus, constitute a transgression of the prohibition mentioned below.</i>.

Anyone who vexes or angers them, hurts their feelings, oppresses them, or causes them financial loss transgresses this prohibition<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The violation of the prohibition is thus dependent on the feelings of the widow or orphans in question.

<p>The commentaries have questioned why, in fact, the minimal punishment of lashes is never given. Though punishment is not given for a transgression that does not involve a deed as mentioned in Halachah 5, it is possible that a person will commit a deed that aggravates a widow or orphan. Why does he not receive lashes in such an instance?</p>
<p>The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> states that since the nature of the prohibition is very subjective, the Torah does not specify any punishment. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> quotes an opinion which maintains that any prohibition that can be violated by speech or thought alone (as is possible in this case) is not liable for lashes even when it is transgressed with a deed. The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that the reason one does not receive lashes is stated by the Rambam himself, namely:</i>, the retribution one suffers for its [violation] is explicitly stated in the Torah (<i>ibid.</i> 22:23): ""I will display My anger and slay you with the sword."" There is a covenant between them and He who spoke and created the world<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When people lose a loved one, they often despair and feel that the world is run in a random and arbitrary manner.

When one causes them suffering for one's own purposes. However, it is permitted for a teacher to cause them suffering while teaching them Torah, or a craft, or in order to train them in proper behavior. Nevertheless<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even though he is given permission to discipline them</i>, he should not treat them in the same manner as he treats others, but rather make a distinction with regard to them and treat them with gentility, great mercy, and honor for [Proverbs 22:22] states: ""For God will take up their cause.""<br>This applies to both those orphaned from their father and those orphaned from their mother<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This point is also mentioned explicitly in the <i>Mechilta</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The commentaries note only one other source which alludes to this concept, the description of Mar Ukva's children as orphans (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 70a) although other references imply that they had only lost their mother.</i>. Until when are they considered orphans in the context [of this mitzvah]? Until they no longer need a mature individual to support, instruct, and care for them and are able to see to all their own needs by themselves, like other adults."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.1,"A person is forbidden to walk behind a synagogue<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This refers to the side of the synagogue on which there is an entrance. However, a person walking on the other side of the synagogue does not appear to dismiss the idea of prayer, since he has not willfully abstained from entering the place of worship (<i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 90).</i> at the time that the congregation is praying, unless he is carrying a burden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since he is carrying a bundle, it is clearly understood why he is not entering the synagogue.</p>

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.2,"One praying with a congregation should not lengthen his prayer excessively<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the passage from <i>Berachot</i> quoted below, it would appear that the prohibition was instituted to prevent the discomfort that would be caused were the congregation to be forced to wait for one individual to finish his prayers.

<p class=""rambam_indented"">Anyone who greets his friend before praying has, so to speak, made his friend into an altar, as [Isaiah 2:22] states: ""Desist from the man whose life is in his nostrils, as for what is he considered.""

<p>Nevertheless, the Talmud explains that this prohibition only applies to going to a friend's house to greet him.

Here, he states that even a snack is forbidden. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that eating a כביצה (the equivalent of an egg, 52 or 100 cubic centimeters, according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and the <i>Chazon Ish</i>, respectively) of fruit, or a כזית (an olive size, approximately 26 or 50 cubic centimeters, according to the same references cited) of bread constitutes <i>achilat ari’ai</i> which we have translated as a snack.</i>, nor [should he] judge [a court case], even if only to render a final judgment, lest the decision be questioned and the matter be drawn out and cause him to miss prayer.<br>Similarly, one should not sit in a barber's chair, even for a regular haircut<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as opposed to the especially intricate haircut given the High Priest, called the haircut of ""ben Elasa"" (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b). (See also <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 5:6)</i>, until he prays, lest the scissors break. He should not enter a tanning house close to <i>Minchah</i> before he has prayed, lest he see a deficiency in his work which he will deal with, and [thereby] be delayed from praying<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam explains, in his commentary on the Mishnah, that if one sees a deficiency in the skin he will attempt to stop further damage, and his involvement in this work could last until after the end of the time for <i>Minchah</i>.</p>
<p>The Rambam's interpretation of the mishnah is not accepted by other authorities. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>) rules that only complicated activities are forbidden and simple acts, e.g., a snack or a normal haircut are permitted.</p>
<p>This disagreement finds expression in the rulings of the later authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) quotes the Rambam's view. The Ramah brings a third opinion (of the <i>Ba'al HaMa'or</i>) which rules that even a large meal is permissible before <i>Minchah Gedolah</i>, and that a snack is permissible even before <i>Minchah K'tanah</i>. He adds that perhaps the reason for this leniency is that since it was customary to call people to synagogue, it is unlikely that they would not forget to go. However, he advises following the more stringent view when praying alone.</i>.<br>If he begins doing one of these things, he need not stop, but may finish and then recite <i>Minchah</i>."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6,"When is the beginning of a haircut?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Halachah 5, the Rambam taught us that if one had already begun his involvement in any of these activities, he need not stop in order to recite <i>Minchah</i>. Therefore, it is necessary to understand what constitutes involvement in these activities.</i> When he puts the barber's cloth over his knees.<br>When is the beginning of a bath?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., when is he considered to be bathing, so that he need not stop to pray?</i> When he takes off his underclothes.<br>When is the beginning of [work in the] tanning house? When he ties the apron between his shoulders, as is the way of artisans<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi explains that the custom in Babylonia was to wear their belts particularly tight, necessitating that they be loosened prior to eating. This was not the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions only the halachah of washing one's hands. Since the Mishnah was written in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, its interpretation must be in line with the customs and realities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam focuses on the actual halachah. Hence, he defines the beginning of eating in line with both positions, one relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the other to Babylonia.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 9b states simply: ""When he ties between his shoulders."" In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that it is when he ties his belt in order to work with the skins. Evidently this means the belt around his apron. There is a version of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah which mentions also that he begins working with the skins. This is, however, hard to understand in light of his commentary here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i>.<br>When is the beginning of eating? For those who live in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is when one washes his hands. For inhabitants of Babylonia, it is when they loosen their belts.<br>When is the beginning of judgment? When the judges robe themselves in their <i>taleisim</i> and sit down. If they were [already] sitting, it is when the adversaries begin to make their claims."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.7,"Even though the Evening Prayer is not obligatory<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 1, Halachah 6 and the commentary there.</i>, one should not come home from his work and say: ""I will eat a little and sleep a little and then I will pray,"" lest sleep overtake him and he sleep all night. Rather, he should [first] pray, and afterwards he may eat, drink or sleep.<br>It is permissible to have a haircut or enter a bathhouse before the Morning Prayer. [The Sages] only established their decree before <i>Minchah</i>, since it is common for most people to go there during the day. However, in the morning, [these actions] are uncommon. Hence, they did not establish a decree."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.8,"A person who is involved in the study of Torah when the time for prayer arrives must stop and pray<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:3, the Rambam states: ""There is no commandment among all the commandments that is equal to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah is equal to all the other commandments, since study brings one to action. Therefore, study comes before action at all times.""</p>
<p>A person involved in Torah study achieves a level of unity with God that is unparalleled by any other activity. One's intellect and God's wisdom become inextricably linked, until they are indistinguishable during the moments of one's actual involvement in study. On this basis, we can understand the description of Torah with the metaphor of bread (Proverbs 9:5, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13). After bread is consumed by a person, it becomes assimilated into his blood and becomes part of the person himself. Similarly, when Torah is studied, it becomes absorbed into the person's character and becomes an integral part of his being (<i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 5).</p>
<p>As explained in the introduction to this text, prayer focuses on our attempt to relate to the Godliness that permeates our worldly existence. Though this is an extremely significant service, the connection established through Torah study is more complete. Thus, <i>Shabbat</i> 10a records how Ravvah rebuked Rav Hamnuna for neglecting his Torah studies to prolong his prayers. By doing he was ""abandoning eternal life for transcient life.""

They spoke about the matter between themselves and decided to reject the Torah.</p>
<p>They began splinter groups which rejected the core of Jewish practice, and coveted material wealth. They found that they could not convince the majority of the people to reject the Torah entirely, so they adopted a different tactic. They claimed that they were true to Torah, but the only Torah that was Divine was the Written Law. The Oral Law was merely a human invention.</p>
<p>This thesis was only a ruse to sway the people from the performance of the mitzvot. Accordingly, the Sages would frequently refer to all those who deny the Torah and its tradition to be Sadducees (""followers of Tzadok"") or Baithosees (""followers of Baithos"").</i>.

If he writes with his left hand, the <i>tefillin</i> should be placed on the right.</p>
<p>Rav Shlomo Kluger, the <i>Tzemach Tzedek</i>, and other later authorities have dealt with questions concerning people who are ambidextrous to varying degrees. Frequently, they have advised that such a person wear <i>tefillin</i> on one of his arms during the prayer service, and afterwards place them on the other arm, to make sure that he fulfills the mitzvah.</i>.<br>The places where to tie and place the <i>tefillin</i> were received as part of the oral tradition."

<p>In that initial version, the Rambam explains (based on <i>Menachot</i> 44a) that the Sages feared that if a person were given license to wear only one <i>tefillah</i>, he might hesitate from purchasing the other one. Therefore, they allowed one to wear a single <i>tefillah</i> only when he already possessed the second one.

On the arm <i>tefillin</i>, one recites: ""[Blessed are You...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to put on <i>tefillin</i>."""
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.5","When does the above apply?

Hence, if no interruption is made between the two, it is unnecessary - and therefore, we are forbidden - to recite a second blessing.</p>
<p>This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:5) and is followed by all Sephardic authorities and some Ashkenazic authorities. The majority of the Ashkenazic community follows the opinion of Rabbenu Asher (quoted by the Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) which maintains that the two blessings should be recited even when no interruption is made between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>.</p>
<p>This opinion agrees that the blessing ""...to put on <i>tefillin</i>"" also applies to the head <i>tefillin</i>. Therefore, even according to this opinion, it is forbidden to make an interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>; nevertheless, the Sages instituted a second blessing in recognition of the unique importance and holiness of the head <i>tefillin</i>.</p>
<p>The later authorities have added that because of the possibility that the second blessing is being recited in vain, one should recite the phrase <i>Baruch shem kavod malchuto le'olam va'ed</i>.</i>.""<br>One should tie the <i>tefillin</i> on one's arm, and afterwards put on the head <i>tefillin</i>.

 A sukkah which does not possess three walls is invalid<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though <i>Sukkah</i> 6b mentions Rabbi Shimeon's opinion, which requires four walls, all authorities accept the more lenient view. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 1:1) explains that their difference of opinion is based on the exegesis of Isaiah 4:6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be a sukkah that will serve as a shadow from the heat during the day, a place of refuge, and a cover from storm and from rain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sages maintain that the verse refers to three different activities, and hence require three walls.

However, if it has two complete walls perpendicular to each other in the shape of [the Greek letter] <i>gamma</i>,

 i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach notes that a <i>gamma</i> has the same shape as the Hebrew letter <i>dalet</i> (see accompanying drawing) and asks why the Sages did not use that letter to refer to the intended shape.

Hence, the Sages did not want to use them as an example to refer to a mundane matter.</i>t is sufficient to construct a third wall that is [only] slightly more than a handbreadth wide and place it within three handbreadths of one of the two walls<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the accompanying diagram.</p>
<p>The Rabbis have posed an abstract question: Is the minimum requirement for a sukkah three walls (including one which is incomplete), or must a sukkah have four walls, however, the Torah was lenient enough to consider a sukkah of this nature as comparable to one of four walls.</p>
<p>The <i>Marcheshet</i> brings support for the latter view, quoting <i>Sukkah</i> 7b, which states that since the third wall only a handbreadth in size is considered to be a wall with regard to the laws of sukkah, it is also considered to be a wall with regard to the laws regarding a private domain on the Sabbath.

[This is necessary,] for any partition that cannot stand before a normal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, a sukkah's inability to stand before a hurricane wind does not invalidate it.</i> land wind is not considered to be a partition."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.6","If a person constructs his sukkah on top of a wagon<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> although the wagon moves and is not fixed in one place (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 22b)</i> or on the deck of a ship, it is kosher, and one may ascend to it on the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., on the first day of Sukkot in Eretz Yisrael and on the first and second days in the diaspora.</i>.

<p>From the Rambam's words, it appears that the restriction applies when the floor of the sukkah is actually in the tree. In contrast, Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 154b), <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 22b and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explain that even if the sukkah is on the ground and only the <i>s'chach</i> is supported by the tree, it is forbidden to use such a sukkah on the festival, lest one place utensils on the <i>s'chach</i>, and thus make use of the tree.</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (628:6) quotes this opinion, but states that at present it is no longer customary to place articles on the <i>s'chach</i>. Therefore, it is permitted to use such a sukkah. His opinion is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 628:7, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 628:17, with one qualification. At the outset, it is desirable not to use an article as support for <i>s'chach</i> unless it is, itself, fit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>. Hence, since the trees themselves are not fit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>, they should not be used as its supports.</i>, because climbing on a tree or animal is forbidden on a festival.<br>If some of the walls were the result of human activity and some were trees, we consider [its structure]. We may ascend to any [sukkah] where, if the trees were taken away, it would be able to stand with the walls that were built by man alone."

A sukkah that does not possess a roof is invalid<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because a dwelling even of a temporary nature must have a roof.</i>. To what does this refer? A sukkah whose walls are joined to each other like a hut; alternatively, when the side of the sukkah is placed against the wall<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Diagram B.</i>. However, if it has a roof, even only a handbreadth in width<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Manoach, and others explain that though leniency is taken and such a sukkah is allowed, it must still possess all the dimensions required of a kosher sukkah mentioned in Halachah 1 of this chapter. Accordingly, at least six handbreadths of the slanted roof must itself be kosher for use as <i>s'chach</i>, and it must be more than 16 handbreadths long, so that it will be of the required height. When the Sukkah meets these qualifications, one is permitted to eat and sleep within it. (See also Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 631:10.)</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> between the two walls, as depicted in Diagram C. As long as it has a roof at least a handbreadth wide, the remainder of the roof may be slanted.</i>, or if one lifted the side of the sukkah close to the wall a handbreadth above the ground, it is kosher.

There were a number of possible forms of this structure. Our halachah (in contrast to <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:35) deals with the following structure: A roof is placed between two walls, and within this roof a hollow place is left to allow sunlight to enter. Pillars are placed at each of the corners of the hole. The question is whether such a structure can serve as a sukkah if one placed <i>s'chach</i> over the hole. See diagram A.</i>hich has projections [extending from its pillars], it is kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Because of the projections, the opening of the ceiling is considered to be a third wall extending over the entire width of the <i>exedrah</i> and reaching the ground (<i>Sukkah</i> 18b) Thus, greater leniency is granted in this instance than in Halachah 3 of this chapter, where a partition four handbreadths in width is required.</p>
<p>Needless to say, as evident from Halachah 5:14, the walls of the <i>exedrah</i> cannot be more than four cubits removed from the <i>s'chach</i>.</i>, regardless of whether the projections can be seen from the inside - although they cannot be seen from the outside - or whether they can be seen from the outside - although they cannot be seen from the inside.

<p>Although it is forbidden to create an enclosure on the Sabbath, since the person serving as the barrier is unaware of what he is doing, no transgression is involved. It is his intention, and not that of the person using the sukkah, which is significant (Ra'avad). In contrast, when the person serving as the wall is conscious of his acts, it is considered as if he has created a structure of substance (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 630:19).</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (ibid.) also states that leniency is granted only when humans serve as the walls. It is absolutely forbidden to create a wall using an animal on the holiday.</i>.

The Sages explained that the verse indicates that shrines which are ""on"" the mountains and the hills and ""under"" the trees must be destroyed, but not the mountains, hills, and trees themselves. Our Sages exclaim: ""Must God cause His world to be destroyed because of the fools?""</i> - provided they were planted originally with the intent of harvesting their fruit - springs which provide water for many people<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's phraseology leads to the conclusion that a spring which provides water for only one person is forbidden if it is worshiped. The <i>Prisha</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145, based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 47a), explains that were an individual to quarry out a spring to worship as a deity, it would be forbidden to benefit from it. Accordingly, when a spring that is worshiped provides water for only one person, we fear that it was quarried out for these purposes. In contrast, when many people benefit from a spring, we do not harbor such suspicions, even when the spring is worshiped.</p>
<p>[In their commentaries on <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145:1, the <i>Turei Zahav</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> reject this premise and maintain that as long as the water is attached to the spring, it is not forbidden, despite its being worshiped. Indeed, the <i>Turei Zahav</i> explains that even the Rambam would accept such a decision. See the commentary on the following halachah.]</i>, and animals, despite their having been worshiped by pagans. It is permitted to partake of fruits that were worshiped in the place where they grow<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nevertheless, after the tree has been worshiped, all the fruits which grow on it during the time it is worshiped are forbidden, as explained in Halachah 3.</i> and to partake of such an animal.<br>Needless to say, it is permitted to partake of an animal that was set aside for the purpose of idol worship. It<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> such an animal</i> is permitted regardless of whether it was set aside to be worshiped or to be sacrificed [to another deity]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 7, Halachah 15, which explains that anything set aside to be offered to an idol is not forbidden until it has actually been offered.</p>
<p><i>Temurah</i> 28b cites a striking example of this principle. Judges (Chapter 6) relates that Gideon offered as a sacrifice to God a bull which his father had been fattening for seven years to offer as a sacrifice to Baal.</p>
<p>When do the above statements permitting the use of an animal - dedicated to an idol apply?</i>.<br>When do the above statements permitting the use of an animal apply? When a deed involving it was not committed for the sake of idol worship. If, however, any deed whatsoever was committed involving it, it is forbidden; for example, one cut one of its signs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The term ""signs"" refers to the windpipe and esophagus, which must both be slit open for ritual slaughter to be acceptable. (See <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 1:9.)</i> for the sake of an idol. Should one exchange it for an idol, it is forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in Chapter 7, Halachah 9. The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that this prohibition applies only with regard to an idol worsiped by a Jew. We are permitted to benefit from anything which a gentile exchanged for an idol.</i>. Similarly, it is forbidden if it was exchanged for an article that was itself exchanged for an idol, since the latter article is considered to be ""payment for an idol.""<br>When does the above apply? Regarding one's own animal. If, however, one<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> - According to the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145), this leniency does not apply when such actions are performed by a gentile. [In this regard, an apostate Jew is considered like a gentile.]</p>
<p>Though the halachah follows the <i>Beit Yosef's</i> opinion, the <i>Or Sameach</i> offers a different interpretation of the Rambam's words, explaining that his statements are explicit, and neither Jew nor gentile can cause his colleague's property to become forbidden.</i> slaughtered a colleague's animal for the sake of a false deity, or exchanged it for an idol, it does not become forbidden, because a person cannot cause an article that does not belong to him to become forbidden.<br>When a person bows down to virgin earth, he does not cause it to become forbidden. If he digs pits, channels, and caverns in it for the sake of a false deity, it becomes forbidden."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.2,"When a person bows down to water which was lifted up by a wave, he does not cause [the water] to become forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 59a states that since the water was not separated by human activity, it is considered to be attached to its source. Hence, it is governed by the principles mentioned in the beginning of the previous halachah.</i>. If, however, he picked [water] up with his hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> is no longer governed by the same rules. Therefore, if a person</i>s and bowed down to it, it becomes forbidden.<br>If rocks which had slid down from a mountain were worshiped in the place where they [landed], they are permitted, since they were not manipulated by man."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.3,"When a Jew stands a brick up with the intention of bowing down to it, but does not bow down to it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Were the scenario to be completed at this point, the brick would not be forbidden, because an object of worship does not become forbidden until it is actually worshiped.</i>, and then a gentile comes and bows down to it, benefit from [the brick] becomes forbidden, because standing it up is considered to be a deed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The explanation of this law (quoted from <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 46a) depends on the difference of interpretation between the <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the <i>Or Sameach</i> mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Or Sameach</i>, who maintains that a gentile cannot cause property belonging to a Jew to become forbidden, this law can be explained as follows: Although the gentile's actions would not generally cause the brick to become forbidden, since the Jew indicated his desire to worship the brick, we assume that he is pleased with the gentile's act. Therefore, it becomes forbidden.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Beit Yosef's</i> opinion (see <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145), which maintains that a gentile can cause a Jew's property to become forbidden, this passage teaches us that the Jew's act is considered sufficient to cause the brick to become forbidden.</i>. Similarly, if he stands an egg up and a gentile comes and bows down to it, it becomes forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad objects to this decision, stating that the principle of considering one object as a ""handle"" of another applies only with regard to questions of ritual purity, and not regarding the prohibition of articles because of their connection with idol worship.</p>
<p>Though Rashi's interpretation of <i>Chulin</i> 128a appears to support the Ra'avad's view, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the Radbaz explain that the passage can also be interpreted according to the Rambam's perspective.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This situation is left as an unresolved question in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>). Rashi explains that the question is whether standing up an egg is, like standing up a brick, a significant act, or whether, because an egg is much smaller than a brick, standing it up is of no significance. Because the question is left unresolved, the Rambam follows the more severe view.</p>
<p>This and the previous law indicate that for a Jew's acceptance of idol worship to be significant in this context, it is necessary for him to perform a deed; a verbal statement or thought is of no consequence.</i>.<br>If one cuts off a gourd or the like and bows down to it, it is forbidden. Even when one bows down to only half the gourd, and the other half is still attached to it, it is forbidden because of the doubt involved: perhaps the second half is considered to be a handle for the half which was worshiped.<br>It is forbidden to benefit from a tree which was planted for the purpose of being worshiped. This is the <i>asherah</i> that the Torah mentions. W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> refers to a technique quite popular as a means of extending vines.

It becomes the base from which a new vine sprouts.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in Exodus 34:13 and in Deuteronomy 7:5 and 12:3. There are many more references in the works of the prophets. See Chapter 6, note 28, which describes the worship of <i>asherot</i>. Note also the statements of the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. I, 49a), which associate the rites of an <i>asherah</i> with the worship of the moon.</i>hen a tree which had been planted previously was pruned and carved for the sake of idol worship - even if it was extended or a growth was grafted onto the trunk of the tree - and branches grew, one must cut off [these] branches, and benefit from them is forbidden.

This is the ritual associated with an <i>asherah</i>. Accordingly, we can assume that [the tree] is an <i>asherah</i>, and therefore its fruits will be used for such purposes."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.4,"[The following rules apply to] a tree under which a false deity was placed:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See also Chapter 7, Halachah 11, which explains (based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 48a) that such a tree is also considered to be an <i>asherah</i>.</i> It is forbidden to benefit from it as long as the deity is located under it.

<p>The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1492) and other authorities note that in other places in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> - e.g., <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 5:5 - the Rambam considers a house, like a mountain or a tree, to be an article which is attached to the earth and beyond man's control. The Radbaz explains that the more stringent position was adopted in our particular instance because of the serious nature of the prohibition against the worship of false deities.</i>.<br>When a [building] which had already been constructed, was plastered and embellished for the sake of worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This also refers to an instance where the building itself is worshiped, and not where it is merely serving as a shrine for the worship of other deities.</i> to the extent that it is considered to be a new entity, one must remove all the new additions, and it is forbidden to benefit from them, since they were made with the intention of being worshiped<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If these ""improvements"" were made by a Jew, his intent is not taken into consideration and the prohibition takes effect only if the building is actually worshiped.</i>.

When it is removed, the house becomes permitted<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145:3) relates that if the house was originally constructed to be a shrine for a false deity, the removal of the idol is not sufficient to cause it to become permitted. Rather, the connection it shares with idol worship must be nullified. Furthermore, such nullification is effective only when the house is owned by a gentile. If it is owned by a Jew, the nullification is of no consequence.</i>.<br>Similarly, it is forbidden to benefit from a stone which was hewn from a mountain with the intention that it be worshiped. If it had already been hewn out, but was adorned and embellished with the intention that it be worshiped - even if the stone itself was adorned and embellished<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e.,the substance of the stone was itself carved and</i> and, needless to say, if the adornment was added to it - one<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a Jew, see above regarding a gentile</i> must remove all the new additions, and it is forbidden to benefit from them, since they were made with the intention of being worshiped. It is, however, permitted to benefit from the remainder of the stone."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.5,"A stone on which an idol<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries explain that the person's house and the shrine share a single wall. The wall is located, however, on property belonging to the shrine.</i> is placed is forbidden as long as the idol is upon it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even though it was not originally hewn out for this intention.</i>.

The intent appears to be that he should move the wall entirely onto his own property. Other authorities, however, include this phrase in the Mishnah. According to their view (which is accepted by the <i>Siftei Cohen, Yoreh De'ah</i> 143:2), one must leave open a space of four cubits.</i>, and then rebuild it. The empty space must not be left free for the sake of the shrine of the idol.

[Similarly,] it is forbidden to benefit from all [the wall's] stones, beams, and earth."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.6,"How must one destroy a false deity<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The placement of this halachah appears problematic. On the surface, it would have been more appropriate to relate it after Chapter 7, Halachah 1, which mentions the commandment to destroy idol worship, or after the following halachah, which completes the description of the types of articles that are forbidden because of their association with idol worship.</p>
<p>Perhaps, since the prohibition against benefiting from the coating of an idol is considered to be a mitzvah in its own right, the Rambam concludes his discussion of the mitzvah to destroy prohibited articles before entering that subject (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).</i> and the other entities which are forbidden on its account - e.g., its accessories and offerings? One must grind them and scatter [the dust] in the wind<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Sages objected to this opinion, maintaining that the dust will serve as fertilizer, and thus benefit man. This objection is not accepted, since the fertilizer is not the only factor causing the crops to grow (see the commentary on Chapter 7, Halachah 14, which describes the concept of 18הז םרוגáהזו), and it was not intentionally used for this purpose (<i>Tosafot, Avodah Zarah</i> 43a).</i>, or burn them and deposit the ashes in the Dead Sea."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.7,"Although [as mentioned above,] an entity which cannot be manipulated by man - e.g., a mountain, animal, or tree - even when worshiped remains permitted<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though, as mentioned in Halachah 1, benefit from these entities is not forbidden, their worship is still considered to be idol worship. Therefore,</i>, it is forbidden to benefit from its coatings. A person who derives any benefit from them whatsoever is [liable for] lashes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries note that in Chapter 7, Halachah 2, the Rambam states that a person who benefits from an idol or its accessories receives two measures of lashes. Thus, one might assume that for this transgression, one should receive two or three measures of lashes. (See the Ramban, <i>Hasagot l'Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, Negative Commandment 194.)</p>
<p><i>Avodat HaMelech</i> explains that since the deity itself is not forbidden, this prohibition is considered to be a separate commandment.<br/>
Accordingly, its transgression is not related to any other prohibitions.</i>, as [Deuteronomy 7:25] states: ""Do not desire the silver and gold which are upon them.""<br>Any coating of<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> - Though the verse mentions only silver and gold, any substance which was intended to adorn an entity worshiped as</i> a false deity is considered to be one of its accessories."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.8,"It is permitted to benefit from a false deity belonging to a gentile whose deification was nullified<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> by performing one of the deeds mentioned in Halachah 10</i> [by gentiles] before<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but not after, (see the following halachah.)</i> it entered the possession of a Jew, as [Deuteronomy, <i>ibid.</i>] states, ""You must burn the statues of their gods with fire."" [This command applies] only if they are treated as gods when they enter our possession. If, however, their deification was nullified, they are permitted."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.9,"A false deity belonging to a Jew can never be nullified. Even if he owns it in partnership with a gentile, its nullification is of no consequence<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></p>
<p><i>Avodat HaMelech</i> explains that since the concept is derived from a Biblical proof-text, there is no difficulty. It is all a matter of Divine decree. In one instance, God desires that the false deities be destroyed, while in another instance He desires that they be entombed.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a false deity - Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:2) distinguishes between a false deity itself and its accessories and adornments, stating that the latter may be nullified by a gentile even after they have been acquired by a Jew.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 53a explains that we consider the Jew to have worshiped the idol through his own process of choice, and not merely as a result of the gentile's influence. Therefore, even though the gentile nullifies his portion, the idol is still forbidden because of the Jew.</i>. Rather, it is forbidden to benefit from it forever, and it must be entombed.<br>Similarly, when a false deity belonging to a gentile enters the possession of a Jew, and then is nullified by a gentile, the nullification is of no consequence, and it is forbidden to benefit from it forever<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Therefore, whenever a Jew wants to take possession of a false deity, he must have it nullified by a gentile before he assumes ownership of it.</p>
<p>A Jew cannot nullify a false deity - An idol can be nullified as a divinity only by a person who once attached importance to it. Since a Jew is, in essence, a believer in the true God, his attachment to idols is merely superficial. Hence, his acts can have no effect upon them.</i>.<br>A Jew cannot nullify a false deity even when it is in the possession of a gentile. A gentile who is a minor or a fool cannot nullify a false deity<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43a relates the following narrative:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi related: Once I was following Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Great on a road. He found a ring with the imprint of a <i>d'rakon</i> (see Chapter 7, Halachah 8) on it. He passed a gentile child without saying anything to him. Afterwards, he met a gentile adult and asked him to nullify it. He refused. Rabbi Elazar struck him and he nullified it.<br/>
We learn from this three things: a) a gentile can nullify an idol whether it belongs to him or to his colleague; b) a gentile who is knowledgeable about idol worship can nullify it, while one who is not knowledgeable cannot nullify it; c) a gentile's nullification of idol worship is effective even if he is compelled to do so.</p>
<p>Neither a minor nor a fool is considered ""knowledgeable about idol worship."" hence, their nullification is not acceptable.</p>
<p>When a gentile is forced to nullify a false deity - whether it belongs to him or to other gentiles - even when he is forced to do so by Jews, the nullification is of consequence.</p>
<p>The gentile who nullifies idol worship must himself be an idolater. - It does not, however, matter whether the idolater worships the particular idol he nullifies or not. For example, a worshiper of Pe'or can nullify a shrine of Marculis (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 64b).</i>. When a gentile is forced to nullify a false deity - whether it belongs to him or to other gentiles, even when he is forced to do so by Jews - the nullification is of consequence.<br>The gentile who nullifies idol worship must himself be an idolater. If he is not an idolater, his nullification is of no consequence.<br>When [a gentile] nullifies a false deity, he also nullifies [the connection to idol worship of] its accessories<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and it becomes permitted to benefit from them. The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:13) states that this law applies even if a Jew had already taken possession of the accessories, so long as the false deity remained in the possession of the gentile.</i>. When he nullifies [the connection to idol worship of] its accessories, it is permitted to benefit from the accessories. [The deity] itself, however, remains forbidden until it is nullified. [The connection to idol worship of] an object that was brought to an idol as an offering<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> whether it was brought by a Jew or gentile</i> can never be nullified."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.10,"How is [an idol] nullified<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation follows the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:4). Others (see Rashi, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 53a) render it as ""smashes its face.""</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> by a gentile, as mentioned in Halachah 8?</i>? When one cuts off the tip of its nose, the tip of its ear, or the tip of its finger, smoothes out its face - even though none of its substance was destroyed - or sells it to a Jewish jeweler<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> By doing so, the gentile implies his willingness to have the Jew smelt down the idol to its precious metal value. Thus, he obviously no longer considers it to be a god.</p>
<p>This point is debated in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 53a, and no explicit conclusion is reached. Most other authorities (and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:8) maintain that selling it to a Jewish jeweler is insufficient to nullify it.</i>, it is nullified.<br>If, however, one gave it as security for a loan, sold it to a gentile<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even a jeweler</i>, [sold it] to a Jew who is not a jeweler, [left it] after it was covered by fallen articles without removing them, did not demand its return after it was stolen by thieves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Such acts appear to indicate that the gentile has little reverence for his idol. (Why should he? Once he sees that the idol cannot save itself, why should he think that it will benefit him?) Nevertheless, as long as he does not do anything that explicitly clarifies that he no longer reveres it, it is not nullified.</i>, spat in its face, urinated upon it, dragged it [in mud], or threw feces upon it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although these acts are irreverent in nature, they could be interpreted as temporary expressions of anger rather than a sincere nullification of the idol's divinity.</i>, it is not nullified."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.11,"When a false deity was abandoned by its worshipers in a time of peace, it is apparent that they nullified it. Hence, benefit may be derived from it. [If it was abandoned] in a time of war, it is forbidden. The only reason they abandoned it was the war<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:10) which states that if the gentiles could return to the idol but do not, it is considered to have been nullified.</p>
<p>When a false deity becomes broken in the course of nature, it is forbidden to benefit from its broken pieces until they have been nullified. - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 41b quotes a difference of opinion on this matter between Resh Lakish and Rabbi Yochanan. Resh Lakish maintains that we can assume that the gentiles nullified their worship of the idol. If it could not save itself, surely it cannot save them.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yochanan does not accept this opinion and maintains that even when an idol is broken it is revered. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 49b states that the gentiles would even worship the broken pieces of an idol. (See also the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:3.)</i>.<br>When a false deity becomes broken in the course of nature, it is forbidden to benefit from its broken pieces until they have been nullified. Accordingly, when a person finds broken pieces of an idol, [he must regard them] as forbidden, lest the gentiles have not nullified them.<br>[The following principles apply to an idol] which comes in pieces: If it could be reassembled by an ordinary person<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the fact that it is broken is not of consequence. Indeed, the laws which govern it are more stringent than if it remained whole.</i>, each piece must be nullified individually. If [an ordinary person] could not reassemble it, once one has nullified one of its limbs, all of them are nullified."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.12,"Though an altar for idol worship has been damaged, it is still forbidden to benefit from it until the majority of it has been destroyed by gentiles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As stated in Halachah 9, the nullification of false deities must be performed by gentiles.</i>.

Torah Study 4.1,"Torah should be taught only to a proper student<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Psalms 50:16 states, ""Wicked man, why do you discuss My laws?""</i> - one whose deeds are attractive - or to a person whose behavior is unknown<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 28a relates that Rabban Gamliel restricted entry to the house of study to any student ""whose inside did not reflect his outside"" - i.e., to anyone whose character did not match his external appearance as a Torah scholar.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamliel's colleagues did not agree with this approach, and when Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah was appointed in his place, these restrictions were lifted. That day, hundreds of students streamed into the house of study, and even Rabban Gamliel felt the need to reconsider his approach. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)</p>
<p>[The <i>Chiddushei Harim</i> questioned Rabban Gamliel's change of heart. Did he not know that when the restrictions were lifted, more students would enter the house of study? However, Rabban Gamliel saw that once the students entered the house of study, the environment had a positive effect on their characters and prompted self-refinement. Therefore, he reconsidered.]</i>. However, [a potential student] who follows bad ways should be influenced to correct his behavior and trained to follow a straight path<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> of Torah living.</i>. [After he repents, his deeds] are examined and he is allowed to enter the house of study to be instructed.<br>O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>ur Sages said: Whoever teaches an improper student is considered as if he throws a stone to Mercury<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., Mercury, the Roman god of wayfarers. His symbol was three stones positioned in the form of a triangle. He was worshiped by throwing stones at that symbol.</i>, as [Proverbs 26:8] states: ""As one who winds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor to a fool."" There is no ""honor"" other than Torah, as [Proverbs 3:35] states: ""The wise shall inherit honor.""<br>Similarly, one should not study from a teacher who does not follow a proper path, even though he<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the teacher</i> is a very wise man and his [instruction] is required by the entire nation, until he returns to a good path, as [implied by Malachi 2:7]: ""For the priest's lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek Torah from his mouth, because he is a messenger from the Lord of Hosts.""<br>O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>ur Sages said: If a teacher resembles ""a messenger<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Hebrew <i>malach</i> also means angel.</i> of the Lord of Hosts,"" seek Torah from his mouth.

Torah Study 4.2,"How is [Torah] taught? The teacher sits at the head and the students sit around him, so that all can see the teacher and hear his words<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Keritot</i> 6a states: ""When you sit before your teacher, look at his face, as [implied by Isaiah 30:20]: 'And your eyes shall behold your teachers.54</i>.<br>The teacher should not sit on a chair, [while] his students [sit] on the ground. Rather, either everyone should sit on the ground or everyone should sit on chairs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Megillah</i> 21a notes that God told Moses (Deuteronomy 5:28 : ""stand together with me."" Since God neither stands nor sits, the verse obviously refers to the proper approach to instruction, where no distinction is made between the teachers and the students.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Nissim and other commentators cite certain Talmudic passages which appear to contradict this principle. He explains that sometimes the teacher would sit in an upraised position, so that the students could hear his words more easily. Alternatively, when a sage possessed <i>semichah</i>, the distinct Rabbinic ordination conveyed in a line from teacher to teacher, stretching back to Moses, he was granted greater privileges.</p>
<p>Originally, the teacher would sit and the students would stand. - The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> notes that this appears to be a direct contradiction to the principle of equality mentioned beforehand. However, he explains that the teachers were allowed to sit in order to be able to relax and transmit the subject matter more clearly. Hence, adopting that position does not represent any superiority over the students.</i>.<br>Originally, the teacher would sit and the students would stand. [However,] before the destruction of the Second Temple, everyone followed the practice of teaching while both they and the students were seated."
Torah Study 4.3,"If the teacher [desires] to instruct the students personally, he is entitled to do so. If he [desires to] teach through the medium of a spokesman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is a difference of opinion between the commentaries regarding the function of this individual. Rashi, <i>Yoma</i> 20b, considers him to be a translator, and, indeed, that is the literal meaning of the term <i>metargaman</i>. In Babylon and even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the popular spoken language was Aramaic, while many of the Sages preferred to teach in Hebrew. Therefore, they would speak to the spokesman in a hushed tone in Hebrew, and he would translate the teachings to Aramaic and teach them to the public in a loud voice.</p>
<p>Others maintain that the spokesman was no more than a ""human microphone."" Rather than have the sage weary himself in speaking in a tone which all could hear, he would speak softly, and the spokesman would speak in a tone that all could hear. This opinion is supported by certain passages (e.g., <i>Kiddushin</i> 31b), which refer to the spokesman as <i>amoriyah</i>, which is the Aramaic for <i>metargaman</i>.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad mentions a third perspective, explaining that the spokesman also communicated the teacher's words in a manner that could be understood and grasped by the students. Rabbi Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch follows a similar, but not identical, view. In <i>Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashanah</i> 5666, he elaborates on this concept in detail, explaining that the teacher was on too high a level to explain his ideas in a manner which the common people could understand. Therefore, he would employ a spokesman, who, though he was able to comprehend the teacher's statements, was on a level that his explanations would not be too sophisticated for the people to grasp. (See also <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 7:12, 9:24.)</p>
<p>The use of a spokesman was also a sign of honor and respect for the teacher. (See Rashi, Deuteronomy 32:44.)</i>, the spokesman should stand between him and the students. The teacher speaks to the spokesman and he announces the teaching to all the students<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in a manner in which they could hear. (See <i>Sotah</i> 40a, <i>Chullin</i> 15a, from which we can derive a picture of the process of instruction.)</i>.<br>When they ask the spokesman a question, he asks the teacher. The teacher, [in turn,] replies to the spokesman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in a hushed tone</i> and the spokesman replies to the questioner.<br>The teacher should not raise his voice above that of the spokesman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Berachot</i> 45a, which quotes the manner in which Moses relayed God's words at the giving of the Torah (Exodus 19:19  as the source for this concept. Nevertheless, others note that the passage in <i>Berachot</i> refers to a <i>metargaman</i> who translates the Torah reading for the people, and is not necessarily relevant to the situation at hand. Rather, they suggest that the descriptions of the use of spokesmen in the passages cited above serve as the source for this idea.</i>. Similarly, when the spokesman asks a question of the teacher, he should not raise his voice above that of the teacher.<br>The spokesman is not allowed to detract from, add to, or change [the teacher's words]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are quoted from the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Megillah</i> 4:10. The Ra'avad differs, and quotes a narrative from <i>Yoma</i> 20b, which relates how Rav served as a spokesman for Rav Shilat and altered the connotation of his words. The Ra'avad explains that since Rav's scholarship was greater than Rav Shilat's, he was entitled to do so.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam did not mention such a possibility, because it is very improbable that a greater sage would serve as a spokesman for a sage of lesser stature.</i>, unless he is the teacher's father or teacher. If the teacher tells the spokesman: ""My teacher told me the following..."" or ""My father and teacher told me the following...,"" when the spokesman relates the teaching to the people, he should quote the statement in the name of the sage [who authored it]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the teacher's father or teacher</i>, mentioning the name of the teacher's father or teacher, saying: ""So and so, the sage, said the following..."" [This is allowed] despite the fact the teacher did not mention the sage's name, because it is forbidden to refer to one's teacher or father by name."
Torah Study 4.4,"If the teacher taught [a concept] and it was not grasped by the students, he should not become upset with them and display anger. Rather, he should repeat and review the matter, even if he must do so many times, until they appreciate the depth of the halachah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Deuteronomy 31:19 states that Torah must be placed in a student's mouth. <i>Eruvin</i> 54b interprets this as a charge to teachers, requiring them to review the subject matter with their students until the latter comprehend it fully. The passage continues, praising Rabbi Pereidah for teaching one of his students each point four hundred times.</p>
<p>Though patience is generally required of a teacher, there are times when he should display anger as explained in the following halachah.</i>.<br>Similarly, the student should not say ""I understood"" when he did not understand. Rather, he should ask again and again, even if he requires several repetitions<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The teacher's patient devotion to his students must be reflected by them. They must dedicate themselves to understanding their teacher's words and steadfastly apply themselves to their study until they comprehend.</i>.

It is necessary that I study, and my powers of comprehension are weak.""<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></p>
<p>He continues (<i>ibid.</i> 2:5) explaining how a teacher should instruct the students ""in a composed and pleasant manner, without shouting."" Here, as well, he does not center on the negative aspects of anger in its own right, but rather its impropriety as an educational technique.</i>"
Torah Study 4.5,"A student should not be embarrassed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> - and therefore be prevented from asking questions.</i> because his colleagues grasped the subject matter the first or second time, while he did not understand it until it was repeated a number of times. If he becomes embarrassed because of such matters, he will find himself going in and out of the house of study without learning anything<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 63b teaches: ""Any student who humbles himself because of the words of Torah will ultimately be uplifted."" Rashi explains that this refers to a student who asks all the questions that bother him even though his colleagues look down upon him.</i>.<br>Accordingly, the Sages of the previous generations stated: ""A bashful person will not learn, nor should the short-tempered teach.""<br>When does the above<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the directive that a teacher should patiently repeat his words without displaying anger</i> apply? When the students did not understand the subject matter because of its depth or because of their limited powers of comprehension. However, if it appears to the teacher that they are not applying themselves to the words of Torah and are lax about them, and, therefore, do not understand, he is obligated to display anger<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This translation is based on <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 2:3, which explains that a person may act in an angry matter to cast fear into the hearts of others. However, he, himself, should not be angry.</i> towards them and shame them with his words, to sharpen their powers of concentration. In this context, our Sages said:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ketubot</i> 103b relates that Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi mentioned this concept in his last will and testament. In particular, this advice was given to his son, Rabban Gamliel, with regard to the manner in which he should conduct himself as a <i>nasi</i>. The Rambam interprets the lesson as more general in nature and applies it to the relationship between every teacher and student.</i> ""Cast fear into the students.""<br>Therefore<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in order to cultivate this aura of respect</i>, it is not fitting for a teacher to act frivolously in the presence of his students. He should not amuse himself in their presence, nor should he eat and drink with them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This does not imply that a teacher must demonstrate a totally stern approach. <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) relates how Rabbah would begin his lectures with a witty statement. His students would laugh and, afterwards, he would sit in awe and begin the lesson.</i>. [These restrictions are intended] so that they fear him and study under him at a fast pace."
Torah Study 4.6,"When the teacher enters the house of study, questions should not be posed to him until he gathers his powers of concentration<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest he be prodded into responding hastily, without thinking out the matter in its entirety</i>. [Thus,] a student should not ask until he sits and rests.<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>wo should not ask at once. A teacher should not be asked about an outside matter, but rather, [only] regarding the subject which they<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> he and the students</i> are involved with, lest he become embarrassed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and give an incorrect reply. <i>Shabbat</i> 3b relates that Rabbi Chiyya gave Rav this advice after he asked a question of Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi concerning an unrelated matter.</p>
<p>In the process of instruction...</i>.<br>The teacher may [deliberately] lead the students astray with his questions and the deeds he carries out in their presence to sharpen their powers of concentration<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., <i>Chullin</i> 43b relates that Rabbah inspected an animal to see whether it was kosher or not, in a manner which contradicted his own teachings. Here, too, it is explained that his intention was to test his students.</i> and to test whether they remember what he taught them or not. Needless to say, he may ask them regarding another matter, which they are not presently involved with, to spur them on."
Torah Study 4.7,"A person should not ask a question while standing, nor should a person respond while standing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for a person is more composed when seated. <i>Berachot</i> 27b and <i>Tosafot, B'chorot</i> 36a mention instances when questions were asked while standing. The <i>Beit HaMelech</i> explains that matters which do not require intense thought may be asked while standing, but matters which require concentration should be discussed when both the questioner and the teacher are seated.</p>
<p><i>Avodat HaMelech</i> explains that the Rambam does not intend to imply that the student should not stand. On the contrary, were he to stand, that would be a sign of respect. Rather, he means that questions should not be addressed to a teacher while the latter is standing.</i>. One should not ask from a high place, from far away, or from behind the elders.<br>A question should be asked of the teacher regarding only the subject which they are reading<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes the apparent redundancy between this statement and a similar one in the previous halachah, and explains that, in the previous halachah, the Rambam meant that when studying the laws of the Sabbath, a student should not ask his teachers about the laws of the festivals. In this halachah, the Rambam teaches that even within the general subject of the Sabbath laws, while studying the laws of one <i>melachah</i> (forbidden act), a student should not inquire regarding another.</p>
<p>Many of the manuscript versions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state <i>k’inyan</i> (to the point), rather than <i>b’inyan sheheim koreim bo</i> (regarding the subject they are reading). According to these texts, there is no redundancy. Rather, this halachah teaches that a student's questions should be direct, without mentioning any extraneous matters.</i>. A question should be asked only with an attitude of awe. A person should ask concerning only three halachot [while studying] the same subject."
Torah Study 4.8,"[The following rules apply when] two people ask questions simultaneously:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A Torah Sage is obligated to answer all questions posed to him, regardless of who the questioner is or what he asks.

[If one question concerns] a matter to be applied in practice, and the other is an abstract question, attention is paid to the question which concerns the matter to be applied.<br>[If one question concerns] Torah law, and the other the interpretation of the verses of the Torah, attention is paid to the question which concerns Torah law<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since questions of Torah law, while not necessarily immediately relevant to actual deed, provide guidelines regarding our future behavior.

A person is able to derive a <i>kal vichomer</i> on the basis of his own process of reasoning. In contrast, since a <i>gezeirah shaveh</i> is not the product of one's own thought process, it is more likely to be forgotten. Hence, it is given precedence.</i>.<br>If of the two questioners, one was a sage and one was a student, attention is paid to the sage; one a student and one a commoner, attention is paid to the student<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though a student need not be honored in the same way as a sage, a student's dedication to Torah study is deserving of a certain measure of respect.</i>.

Torah Study 4.9,"One should not sleep in a house of study.

<p>Two reasons are given for this decree:</p>

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.7,"We do not suspect that a weasel dragged chametz into a place where it is not usually brought.

<p>In contrast, the Rambam interprets the statement as applying before the search.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.8,"Similarly, a person who saw a mouse enter the house with chametz in its mouth after he searched [for chametz] must search a second time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this instance as well, there is an obvious reason for the suspicion that chametz has been brought into the home.</i>.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.10,"Nine piles of matzah and one of chametz were placed [aside]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For example, after the search for chametz, a person will still have some chametz in his property for use the following morning.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.11,"There were two piles: one of chametz and one of matzah, and two houses: one that had been searched and one that had not been searched. Two mice came; one took chametz and one took matzah [and they entered the houses] without our knowing which house the mouse holding the chametz entered<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In such an instance, we presume that the mouse holding the chametz entered the unchecked house, and the mouse holding the matzah entered the checked house. Comparable decisions are found in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 13:14, <i>Hilchot Issurei Biyah</i> 9:29 and <i>Hilchot Mikvaot</i> 10:3.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> 10a emphasizes that this leniency is only rendered because once a person has nullified ownership over his chametz, the search is only a question of Rabbinic law. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:4) agrees to this principle, but offers an addition leniency: Even if the owner did not nullify his chametz, a second search is not required when the bread the mouse was holding is small enough to be eaten at once.</i>...<br>Similarly, there were two houses which had been checked, with one pile of chametz before them.

However, we do not know which house he entered...<br>or we saw which one he entered, a person followed him, checked [for chametz], and did not find anything<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 10a compares this to a case in which a corpse was presumed to be found in a field. Though Rabbi Meir maintains that the field is considered ritually impure until the corpse is found, the halachah follows the Sages, who maintain that all that is necessary is to carry out a thorough search. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:6) states that this law applies even when the owner of the house had not nullified his chametz, and the search is required by Torah law.</i>...<br>or he checked and found bread...<br>Similarly, when there were nine piles of matzah and one of chametz, and a loaf became separated from the piles, and we do not know whether it was chametz or matzah: If a mouse took the loaf that became separated and entered the house that had been checked<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The passage from <i>Pesachim</i> 9b concerning the ten butcher shops quoted in the commentary on the previous halachah, continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[If meat from these shops] is found, follow the majority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The principle of קבוע - judging the permitted and forbidden substances as if they were equal - applies only when the doubt concerning the identity of the substance arises in the place where the presence of the forbidden substance has become fixed. Thus, since the meat has become separated (פירש) from its original place, this principle no longer applies and, as in most cases of mixtures, the decision depends on whether there is a greater number of kosher or non-kosher stores.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the case at hand: Since the loaf became separated from the piles before being taken by the mouse, there is no question of a prohibited substance having a fixed identity (קבוע). Hence, we follow the majority, and thus do not require a further search. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> emphasize that this leniency applies even if the owner of the house had not nullified the ownership over his chametz.</i>:<br>In all of these cases, there is no need to check a second time, because the presence of the forbidden substance is not fixed."

<p>In <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 6:3, the Rambam declares that none of the money is considered as <i>ma'aser sheni</i>. In both instances, we suppose that the substance put aside was taken away and a new substance substituted for it. Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> emphasizes that the owner cannot cease his search until he finds nine piles of chametz. This law applies even if the owner has nullified his ownership over the original nine piles of chametz.</i>...<br>or a mouse came and took the chametz, and there is a doubt whether he entered this house or not...<br>In all these cases, he must search [the house again].<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>"

<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442:28) explains that dough which has not become stuck to the cracks of the kneading trough must be removed. However, leniency may be taken regarding dough stuck in the cracks of the kneading trough, even though it does not serve a purpose. Should the owner nullify his ownership over his chametz, that dough need not be destroyed if:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Possibly, the Rambam's choice of sequence can be explained as follows: The motivating principle of many of the previous halachot is that once a person has nullified the ownership over his chametz, the search is merely a Rabbinic obligation. Hence, many leniencies can be taken.</p>

The child's father is obligated to educate him. If he has no father, the obligation falls on his mother and on the local Rabbinic court (<i>Terumat Hadeshen</i> 99).</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) differs and explains that the Sages placed the obligation on the minor himself. From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he accepts this view.</p>
<p>Support for this premise can be derived from the Rambam's decision in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who ate a small meal can fulfill his obligation by listening to a child reciting the grace after meals (for both are obligated by virtue of Rabbinic decree).

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.2","The sick and their attendants<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the latter's performance of a mitzvah - tending to the sick - does not enable them to perform the mitzvah of dwelling in the sukkah, they are absolved from the obligation.

However, this leniency is granted only during the time the sick person requires their assistance (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:7).</i> are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah] of sukkah. This applies not only to a person who is dangerously ill, but also to one with a headache<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or any other minor illness (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:4).</p>
<p>This leniency is granted because of one of the basic principles related to the mitzvah of sukkah. Leviticus 23:42 states: ""You shall dwell in sukkot (תשבו בסכת)."" On that verse, <i>Sukkah</i> 26a comments: תשבו כעין תדורו - i.e., dwelling in the sukkah is comparable to living in one's own home. Thus, a person is not required to dwell in a sukkah under circumstances which would cause him to leave his own home.</p>
<p>Since a person who is sick would seek the most comfortable lodgings possible and would not camp outside, he is not obligated to do so to fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah (Rabbenu Manoach).</i> or a sore eye.<br>A person who is uncomfortable [when dwelling in the sukkah] is freed from the obligation [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> based on the principle of תשבו כעין תדורו, as explained above. Just as a person would seek out a comfortable permanent dwelling, he is obligated to dwell only in a sukkah which does not cause him unpleasantness.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach states that this leniency does not apply on the first night of Sukkot, on which there is a binding obligation to eat in the sukkah. (See Halachah 6.) The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 640:4) quotes this statement as halachah.</i>. This applies to the person himself, but not to his attendants.<br>Who is ""a person who is uncomfortable [when dwelling in the sukkah]""? A person who cannot sleep in the sukkah because of the wind or because of the flies, mites, or the like, or because of the smell."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.3","A mourner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The term אבל refers to a person in the seven days of mourning which follow the burial of a father, mother, wife, brother, sister, son, or daughter. An אונן (a person in mourning for these relatives before their burial) is freed from the obligation of sukkah, because he is absolved of the duty to perform all mitzvot (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 4:6).</p>
<p>It must be noted that none of the mourning rites should be followed during a festival. If a close relative dies before the festival, the <i>shiv'ah</i> (seven days of mourning) is completed at the festival's commencement, even though all seven days have not passed (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 10:3, 8).</i> is obligated [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah.<br>A groom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because he is involved in the mitzvah of marriage. <i>Sukkah</i> 25b adds that generally, a sukkah is to small to carry out the wedding celebrations in the proper manner.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.4","Emissaries charged with a mission involving a mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., to study Torah, to greet a Sage under whom one studied Torah, or to redeem captives (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 25a).</i> are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah] of sukkah both during the day and at night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi (<i>Sukkah</i> 25a, 26a) states that this applies even when they are lodging overnight. Since, at night they are also involved with thinking about how to fulfill the mitzvah, they are still considered as occupied with the performance of a mitzvah and are not required to seek out a sukkah. An example of this principle quoted by the Talmud supports this interpretation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Rav Chisda and Rabbah bar Rav Huna would attend [the lecture delivered] at the home of the exilarch on the Sabbath of the festival, they would sleep along the river banks of Sura.</p>
<p>They explained: ""We are emissaries involved in a mitzvah"" (<i>Sukkah</i> 26a).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though these Sages were visiting a city which served as a center of Jewish life and surely could have found a sukkah to lodge in, they did not see the necessity for doing so. (See also <i>Sukkah</i> 10b.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 10b, interprets the passage differently and explains that leniency is granted these emissaries only when dwelling in the sukkah would in some way prevent them from carrying out the mitzvah which they set out to perform. If it is possible to do both - perform the mitzvah they set out to do and fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah - one must endeavor to do so.</p>
<p>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam shares Rashi's view. However, the final halachic position followed by most Ashkenazic authorities is closer to <i>Tosafot</i>'s position: i.e., these emissaries are not obligated to trouble themselves to find a sukkah. However, if there is a sukkah available, they should make use of it. Nevertheless, if sleeping in the sukkah would prevent them from getting proper rest, and thus hold them back from fulfilling their mitzvah in a proper manner, they are not required to sleep in a sukkah (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:18; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 640:38).</p>
<p>(Abstractly, it is possible to differentiate between the two positions as follows. According to Rashi, there is no obligation of sukkah incumbent on this person whatsoever. In contrast, <i>Tosafot</i> would maintain that the person is obligated to perform the mitzvah. However, at all times he is bound by another commitment which takes precedence.)</i>.

There is a difference of opinion among the later halachic authorities if this decision also applies when one sits down to a party centering on drinking wine (קובע עצמו לשתות). Some (the <i>Bach</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:12) require that such drinking be carried out in a sukkah.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.10","If rain descends, a person may enter his home<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We need not wait until the food actually spoils.

<p><i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there is a fundamental difference between this law and the case of a person who is uncomfortable while in the sukkah. In the latter instance, in essence, the person is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. However, because of his discomfort, his obligation is temporarily waived. In contrast, when rain descends it is impossible to fulfill the mitzvah at all, because the sukkah is not fit to dwell in. Hence, there is no obligation whatsoever.</p>
<p>There is a practical difference between these two abstract positions regarding the question whether a person is obligated to eat in the sukkah on the first night of the holiday even when it rains. (See the commentary on Halachah 7.) According to the <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, under these circumstances there is no mitzvah which one is required to fulfill. Thus, one may eat at home. In contrast, most authorities do not differentiate between rain and other uncomfortable situations. Thus, since eating in the sukkah on that night is a binding obligation, they require a person to fulfill the mitzvah.</p>
<p>There is a further aspect to this concept. The Maharil explains that a person who eats in a sukkah when he is not obligated to do so is a simple person and receives no reward for his ""piety."" On this basis, in many communities, people make no effort to stay in the sukkah when it rains. In contrast, there are some communities where people will continue to eat in the sukkah despite pouring rain.</p>
<p>What is the difference between these two approaches? The first approach follows the perspective that, during the rain, there is no mitzvah to dwell in the sukkah whatsoever. Hence, there is no need to strain oneself to remain there. In contrast, the second perspective does not differentiate between rain and any other uncomfortable circumstances, but maintains that, in essence, dwelling in the sukkah is a mitzvah even under such circumstances. Accordingly, they remain in the sukkah, because while they are involved in fulfilling God's will they do not feel even the slightest trace of discomfort.</i>.

Nevertheless, dwelling in the sukkah on the eighth day does not constitute a violation of this commandment, because the time when the mitzvah is to be performed has already passed. Placing a fifth passage in one's tefillin during the day violates this commandment, because we are obligated to perform the mitzvah at this time. However, once the seven days of Sukkot pass, there is no mitzvah associated with the sukkah whatsoever (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28b).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many Ashkenazic authorities would carry out additional safeguards regarding this matter. For example, the <i>Tur</i> relates (though he opposes this practice himself) that some follow the custom of eating in the Sukkah only on the day of Shemini Atzeret, but not the night. Many of the Rabbis who would sleep in the Sukkah throughout the festival refrain from doing so on Shemini Atzeret. (See <i>K'tav Sofer</i>, Responsum 120.)</i>. On the eighth day, which is the first day of the holiday of Shemini Atzeret, we dwell in the sukkah, but do not recite the blessing <i>leishev basukkah</i>.<br>S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because as the Rambam explains, a blessing is not recited when a mitzvah is performed only because of a doubt.</p>
<p><i>Sukkah</i> 47a relates that ""Rav Huna bar Bizna and all the great Sages of the generation dwelled in a sukkah on the eighth day - which might have been the seventh day - [of the festival], but did not recite a blessing.""</i>imilarly, a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i> never recite the blessing <i>leishev basukkah</i>, because their obligation [to perform the mitzvah is based] on doubt, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., they are required to perform the mitzvah because of the doubt concerning their status: maybe they are to be considered men.</i>nd a blessing is never recited when one is doubtful [of one's obligation]."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.14","After a person finishes eating on the eighth day [of Sukkot], he should take down his utensils and remove them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> from the sukkah and bring them home, where he will eat on Simchat Torah.</i>.<br>When a person has no place to put the utensils, [the following rules<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> safeguards adopted to differentiate between eating in the sukkah as required, and eating there afterwards</i> apply]: If it is a small [sukkah], he should bring his candelabra into it; if it is a large sukkah, he should bring in his pots, plates, and the like<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which are generally kept outside the sukkah, as explained in Halachah 5.</i>, to bring to mind that it is no longer acceptable and that its mitzvah is completed.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i> Since the day is a holiday, one may not reduce its space and nullify it."

One should even construct a sukkah on the final moments of the seventh day, because its mitzvah lasts throughout the seventh day.<br>The wood with which the sukkah was constructed is forbidden [to be used for other purposes] on all eight days of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 9a derives the prohibition against using the wood of the sukkah for other purposes throughout Sukkot from Leviticus 23:34: ""The Sukkot festival shall be seven days unto God."" The latter term is used also regarding the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering sacrificed on the festival. Thus, its use in this context implies that the entities which enable us to celebrate the Sukkot festival must be consecrated ""unto God"" like those sacrifices.</p>

As mentioned in the commentary on Halachot 17 and 18, the sukkah decorations are not considered an independent entity, but rather as part of the sukkah itself. Furthermore, employing articles used to decorate a mitzvah for other purposes demonstrates lack of respect for the mitzvah (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Beitzah</i>). Hence, the same restrictions that apply to the sukkah apply to it.</i> for all eight days [of the festival]. However, if at the time one hung [the decorations]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach questions what the law would be if the condition were made after the decorations were hung but before the holiday commences.</i>, he made the condition: ""I will not refrain from using them during the entire period of <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>,"" he is entitled to use them whenever he desires<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In contrast to the walls or <i>s'chach</i>, in this instance the condition has an effect.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.1","In what manner are the <i>tefillin</i> [placed on] the head written? [The] four passages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 1: <i>Kadesh Li</i> (Exodus 13:1-10), <i>V'hayah ki y'viacha</i> (Exodus 13:11-16), <i>Shema</i> (Deuteronomy 6:4-8), and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> (Deuteronomy 11:13-21).</i> are written on four parchments and rolled closed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> more precisely, folded closed. Though in this halachah, the Rambam mentions only the <i>tefillin</i> of the arm, the parchments in the <i>tefillin</i> of the head are also folded from the end to the beginning, so that when they are opened, one begins reading at the beginning (Chapter 3, Halachah 7).</i>, each as a separate entity. They are placed in four compartments, which are covered by a single piece of leather.<br>The four passages of [the <i>tefillin</i> placed on] the arm are written on four columns on a single parchment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> They may, however, be written on four separate parchments, which are later glued together (<i>Menachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i>. They should be rolled closed like a Torah scroll from the end to the beginning and placed in a single compartment."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.2","Care must be taken in writing these passages. If one wrote a passage which should be <i>s'tumah</i> a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam explains at length in Chapter 8, there are two general categories for the passages of the Torah, <i>s'tumah</i> and <i>p'tuchah</i>.</p>
<p><i>S'tumah</i> means ""closed."" It refers to a passage whose first word is always written in the middle of a line in the Torah. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)</i>s <i>p'tuchah</i> or a passage which should be <i>p'tuchah</i> as <i>s'tumah</i>, it is invalid.<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:36) quotes an opinion which explains that the <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified for such an error. Since there is a difference between <i>tefillin</i> and a Torah scroll - in a Torah scroll, there are many other passages between <i>Shema</i> and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> - the <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified if <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> is written as <i>p'tuchah</i>. Contemporary Ashkenazic practice is based on this opinion. [Note our commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 2.]</i>he first three passages are all <i>p'tuchot</i>, while the final passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>, is <i>s'tumah</i>."
"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.3","One must be careful regarding [the spelling of the words in these passages] with regard to the short or full form<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are times when the Hebrew vowels <i>cholam</i> and <i>shuruk</i> are written with a letter <i>vav</i>, and times when that letter is omitted. Similarly, there are times when the vowel <i>chirik</i> is written with a <i>yud</i>, and times when that letter is omitted.</p>
<p>The expression, <i>malei</i>, rendered as ""full form,"" refers to the form which includes the extra letter. <i>Chaseir</i>, rendered as ""short form,"" refers to the form which lacks the extra letter.</i>. [The manner in which] these four passages are written [in <i>tefillin</i>] should resemble the manner they are written in a Torah scroll that has been checked [for accuracy in this regard].<br>When one writes a word which requires a short form using a full form, it is invalid until one erases the extra letter<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned above, every letter of the four passages in the <i>tefillin</i> must be written in order. Nevertheless, although an entire passage was written, correcting a word by erasing an extra letter is not a contradiction to this principle.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:23) mentions that a problem may arise if the letter to be erased is in the middle of a word, since, when it is erased, the space left will cause the word to appear divided. The commentaries explain that the difficulty can sometimes be corrected by extending a letter, for example, writing a <i>resh</i> with an extended upper line.</i>. If one writes a word which requires a full form using a short form, it is invalid and may not be corrected.<br>These are [the correct spellings of the words that could present difficulties] with regard to the short and full forms in these four passages."

<p>Though this decision is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 39:10), a qualification is already made. A pair of <i>tefillin</i> which is not worn on a regular basis should be checked twice in seven years. The later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 39:11 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:26) suggest checking even <i>tefillin</i> that are worn regularly. At present, perhaps because of the differences in the way the compartments are made or in the parchment or ink that is used, it is very common for letters in <i>tefillin</i> to smudge, fade, and crack. The <i>Mateh Efrayim</i> suggests that each person have his <i>tefillin</i> inspected every year.

Torah Study 1.11,"A person is obligated to divide his study time in three: one third should be devoted to the Written Law; one third to the Oral Law<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., <i>Mishnah</i>. This is not intended to mean only the <i>Mishnah</i> authored by Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi per se, but rather ""halachic decisions without being concerned with their motivating principles"" (Rashi, <i>Sotah</i> 22a). As is obvious from his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, where he defines it as ""a collection of the entire Oral Law,"" the Rambam desired that his <i>Mishneh Torah</i> serve this purpose.</p>
<p>According to <i>Siftei Cohen, Choshen Mishpat</i> 25:7, the term <i>Mishnah</i> applies to the halachic decisions of contemporary authorities as well.

The latter topic is called <i>Gemara</i>."
Torah Study 1.12,"How is the above expressed?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin, ibid.</i>, asks this question, noting that, on the surface, it is impossible to divide one's years in three, since no one knows how long he will live.</i> A person who is a craftsman may spend three hours each day involved in his work, and [devote] nine hours to Torah study<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Examples chosen by the Rabbis reflect common situations.

The matters referred to as <i>Pardes</i> a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam offered this explanation to resolve the apparent contradiction between the commonly accepted practice of devoting most of one's time to the study of the Babylonian Talmud, and the injunction to divide one's study time in three. In response to the same question, <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 30a explains that the study of the Babylonian Talmud also fulfills that directive, because it combines all three areas of study in a single text.</p>
<p>At present, this pattern of study is not followed even in the early stages of a child's learning. Note the Maharal of Prague, <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>, Chapter 56, and the <i>Sh'lah, Masechet Shavuot</i>, who complain that the advice given in <i>Avot</i> 5:22: ""At five, to the study of the Written Law; at ten, to the study of the Mishnah; and at fifteen, to the study of the Gemara"" is not generally followed.</p>
<p>The basis for this departure can be explained in terms of two differences that exist between our contemporary circumstances and the situation which prevailed in Talmudic times:<br/>
a) During the Talmudic era, written texts were rare, and it was necessary for a student to commit all his subject matter to memory. Thus, the emphasis was on teaching students by rote.<br/>
b) Hebrew was a spoken language and, therefore, it was not necessary to spend time teaching the children the meaning of the subject matter.</p>
<p>At present, the major emphasis is on teaching learning skills and developing a student's powers of comprehension with the understanding that once one knows how to study, since the texts are easily available, he will be able to apply himself to the actual study at his convenience.

However, when a person increases his knowledge and does not have the need to read the Written Law, or occupy himself with the Oral Law constantly, he should study the Written Law and the oral tradition at designated times. Thus, he will not forget any aspect of the laws of the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as mentioned above, a lack of review will cause an individual to forget what he has already learned.</i>. [However,] he should focus his attention on the <i>Gemara</i> alone for his entire life, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> choosing the subject matter and the allocation of his time...</i>ccording to his ambition and his ability to concentrate."

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 6.6","[The gates to] the Temple Mount<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There was a wall around the complex of the Temple Mount separating it from the remainder of the city of Jerusalem. It had five gates, as described in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:2.</i>, its chambers, courtyards, and, similarly, entrances to synagogues<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which are referred to as ""sanctuaries in microcosm"" (<i>Megillah</i> 29a)</i> and houses of study which do not have apartments in which people live do not require <i>mezuzot</i>, because they are consecrated<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Yoma</i> 11b derives this concept from the exegesis of Deuteronomy 6:9: ""And you shall write them on the doorposts of your homes.""

<p>The <i>Chatam Sofer</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 281) asks: Since the Chamber of Parhedrin was the only portion within the Temple Courtyard used as a person's dwelling, why does the Rambam state that these entrances do not require <i>mezuzot</i> because they are consecrated? Since they are not used as a dwelling, why would one think they require a <i>mezuzah</i>?</p>
<p>The <i>Chatam Sofer</i> explains that the Temple is a dwelling - in fact, the ultimate dwelling, the resting place of the Divine Presence. Nevertheless, since it is not a dwelling for humans, it does not require a <i>mezuzah</i>.</i>.<br>A synagogue in a village in which guests reside requires a <i>mezuzah</i>. Similarly, a synagogue in a metropolis, if it has an apartment, requires a <i>mezuzah</i>.<br>All the gates in the Temple complex did not have <i>mezuzot</i>, with the exception of the Gate of Nicanor<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The central gate to the Temple Courtyard. (See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 5:5.)</p>
<p>The Gate of Nicanor required a <i>mezuzah</i> because it was the gate directly before the Chamber of Parhedrin. As explained in Halachah 8, the gate of a courtyard which leads to a dwelling requires a <i>mezuzah</i>. Based on this rationale, Rav Kapach asks why the gates before the Gate of Nicanor did not require a <i>mezuzah</i>, since they led to a gate which led to a dwelling.</i> and those further within<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others note that the Rambam's text differs from his source (<i>Yoma</i>, loc. cit.), which reads ""the Gate of Nicanor and the Chamber of Parhedrin, which was further within."" He does explain, however, that the Rambam's version is acceptable: Since all these gates lead to the Chamber of Parhedrin, they therefore require a <i>mezuzah</i>.</p>
<p>Rav Kapach supports this interpretation, noting that the Chamber of the Hearth also served as a dwelling for the priests, and hence, the gate to it would require a <i>mezuzah</i>. According to this interpretation, this gate is also included, while according to our text of the Talmud, it is not.</i>, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber served as a dwelling for the High Priest during the seven days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Yoma</i> 10b, which states that the obligation to place a <i>mezuzah</i> on the gate of Nicanor and the Chamber of Parhedrin applies only during these seven days and not throughout the entire year. Nevertheless, since as stated in Chapter 5, Halachah 11, one should not remove a <i>mezuzah</i> after leaving a dwelling, the <i>mezuzah</i> should remain there (Rav Kapach).</i> when he was separated [from his home in preparation for the Yom Kippur service]."

<p>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> points out that even Chapter 4 refers to certain actions which were only problematic לכתחילה, such as burping and sneezing.

<p>The <i>Prisha</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) maintains that it is unlikely that a person would fear falling from such a low height and offers a different rationale.

<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 629:2 states that this decision applies only before these arrows were placed in the arrowhead.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.6","A mat of reeds, of raw rubber, or of hemp - if it is small, we may assume that it was made to lie on<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries note an apparent contradiction in the Rambam's words. <i>Hilchot Keilim</i> 25:13 states that even a small mat of reeds or hemp is not subject to contracting ritual impurity, because it is uncomfortable to lie on.</i>. Therefore, it may not be used for <i>s'chach</i> unless it was [explicitly] made for this purpose.<br>If it is large<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Sukkah</i> 20a. It must be noted that his decisions are dependent on the version of the text of the Talmud he accepted. The Ra'avad and others interpret the word גדולה as related to the word גדיל (tassel). Thus, they explain that the Talmud is referring to a small mat. However, because it is made of thick tassels, rather than woven, it is not comfortable to lie on, and hence would most likely be used for shade. According to this opinion, any woven mat, even if it is large, is unfit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 629:6) quotes the Rambam's interpretation.</i>, we may assume that it was made for shade; therefore, it may be used for <i>s'chach</i> unless it was [explicitly] made to lie on.<br>If it has a border<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a small lip (<i>Sukkah</i> 20b)</i>, even a large mat may not be used as <i>s'chach</i>, because it is considered to be a receptacle. Even if the border were removed, it may not be used as <i>s'chach</i>, because it would be considered to be a broken utensil."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.7","Boards which are less than four handbreadths wide<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In many places throughout the Talmud, four handbreadths is established as the minimum size of an area. Hence, a board of that size is considered significant and may not be used as <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Sukkah</i> 14a).</i> may be used for <i>s'chach</i> even though they have been planed. If they are more than four handbreadths wide, they should not be used as <i>s'chach</i>, even though they have not been planed. This is a decree [instituted] lest one sit under a roof and regard it as a sukkah.<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A person might think: ""What is the difference between the sukkah and my house - they are both covered with boards?"" This is surely a false assumption. As explained in the following halachah, since the boards of a roof were not placed there for the purpose of shade, but rather to be part of the permanent structure of the house, they cannot be considered to be <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Sukkah</i> 14a; Rabbenu Manoach).</i>f one placed a board which was more than four handbreadths wide over [a sukkah, the sukkah] is kosher. However, one should not sleep under the board<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, because it is part of the wall; according to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, because it appears to be a separate domain.</i>. A person who did sleep under the board has not fulfilled his obligation.<br>There were boards that were four handbreadths wide, but less than four handbreadths thick. A person turned them on their side so that they would not be four handbreadths wide to use them as <i>s'chach</i>. This is not acceptable, because a board is unacceptable for use as <i>s'chach</i> whether one uses its width or thickness."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.8","A roof which is not covered by a ceiling - i.e., the plaster and the stones - but rather has only boards fixed in place, is not acceptable, since they were not placed there for the purpose of a sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> from their place. (Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 631:9 does not mention this requirement, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 631:4 does.)</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as required by the following halachah</i>, but to be part of the house.<br>Therefore, if one lifted up the boards and removed the nails with the intent [that they serve] as a sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Therefore</i>, it is kosher. [This applies provided] that each board is not four handbreadths wide.<br>Similarly, it is kosher if one removed a board from between two others and replaced it with kosher <i>s'chach</i>, with the intention [that it serve] as a sukkah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.9","A sukkah that was made for any purpose whatsoever - even if it was not made for the purpose of [fulfilling] the mitzvah - if it was made according to law<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 8b quotes a <i>baraita</i> which contains the latter statement and questions: ""What does 'according to law' mean?...That it was made for the purpose of shade.""</p>
<p>It appears that the Rambam uses the same expression, but with different implications. Since he explicitly states that the sukkah must be constructed for the purpose of shade, one might infer that the expression ""according to law"" is intended to include other concepts. Thus, it can be a reference to the requirements for a sukkah's size and the nature of the materials used for the <i>s'chach</i>, as mentioned in this and the previous chapter.</i>, it is kosher. However, it must be made for the purpose of shade<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Isaiah 4:6 states: ""It shall be a sukkah for shade from the heat...,"" thus defining the purpose of such a structure. A sukkah constructed for the purposes of modesty is not acceptable (Rabbenu Manoach).</i>. Examples of this are sukkot made for gentiles, sukkot made for animals, and the like.<br>In contrast, a sukkah that came about on its own accord<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., branches fell over a frame, and of course, any time a roof is covered for other purposes - e.g., the construction of a home, as mentioned in the previous halachah...</i> is unacceptable, because it was not made for the purpose of shade. Similarly, when a person hollows out a place in a heap of produce and thus makes a sukkah, it is not considered to be a sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkot</i> 12a explains that there is an added factor involved in this example. Deuteronomy 16:13 states: ""Make a [celebration of] the Sukkot holiday for seven days."" This refers to the construction of the sukkah and teaches that we must ""make"" a sukkah and not use what was already made. Therefore, despite the fact that the person hollowed out the space for the purpose of shade, the sukkah is not acceptable, because the produce was not originally placed there for that purpose.</p>
<p>We find a similar principle concerning <i>tzitzit</i>. Deuteronomy 22:12 states: ""Make yourself tassels on the four corners of your garments."" On the basis of this command, <i>Menachot</i> 40b teaches that it is unacceptable to tie <i>tzitzit</i> to a three-cornered garment and then cut a fourth corner, since we are required to make <i>tzitzit</i>, and not use what is already made.</i>, because the produce was not piled there for this purpose. Accordingly, were one to create a space one handbreadth [high]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We find the measure of one handbreadth considered to define a structure with regard to the laws of ritual impurity. Accordingly, it is given significance in this context as well. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 16a.)</i> and seven [handbreadths] in area for the purpose of a sukkah, and afterwards hollow it out till it reached ten [handbreadths]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the minimum height of a sukkah, as explained in Chapter 3, Halachah 1.</i>, it is kosher, since its <i>s'chach</i> was placed for the purpose of shade."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.10","We may not use bundles of straw, bundles of wood or bundles of reeds as <i>s'chach</i>. T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although, according to the Torah's requirements, these would be considered proper <i>s'chach</i>...</i>his decree [was instituted] lest one place those bundles on one's roof to dry out, and then change one's mind and sit under them with the intent [that they serve as] a sukkah. The person did not place the <i>s'chach</i> there originally for the purpose of shade. Thus, it resembles a sukkah that came about on its own accord.<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which is unacceptable, as explained in the previous halachah.</i>f one untied [the bundles], they are acceptable [for use as <i>s'chach</i>].

Small bundles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the reason for the addition of the adjective, noting that if the bundles contain fewer than twenty five units, they are permitted, as stated in the previous halachah. Others mention that this refers to bundles of small branches.</i> that were tied together [to be sold] by number may be used as <i>s'chach</i>.<br>S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, if one were to add even one branch and then tie them together, it would be considered to be a bundle (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 629:15).</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 13b relates that bundles of this nature were frequently used in Sura, and that the Sages permitted them to be used as <i>s'chach</i>.</i>imilarly, if one cuts off the top of a date palm and the branches are bound to it, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>, because elements that are bound naturally are not considered to be bundles. Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side, and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>. A single tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together naturally.<br>Similarly, any knot which is not strong enough to hold when carried is not considered a knot [and the resulting bundle may be used as <i>s'chach</i>]."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.12","A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his home<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the sukkah is unacceptable. This applies only when the shade the tree produces exceeds the open area. However, if there is more open space under the tree than shade, the sukkah may be kosher.</p>
<p>The determination of whether such a sukkah is kosher depends on a number of principles, based on the interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 9b and 11a. The Rambam's interpretation of that passage, and thus the ground rules he establishes, differ from those accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1-2).</p>
<p>In the following halachah, the Rambam deals with the resolution of the question when no effort has been made to correct the problem of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>. As will be explained, there his interpretation is contested by other authorities. In this halachah, the Rambam describes the rulings which govern the situation when an effort has been made to rectify the situation by detaching the branches from their source of nurture. These are based on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 11a, and are also accepted by other Rabbinic authorities. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:2.)</i>.<br>If one draped the leaves and branches of trees [over the sukkah], and then placed <i>s'chach</i> over them, and only afterwards detached them, [the following rules apply:]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><br>If the amount of [kosher] <i>s'chach</i> exceeded [the branches], it is kosher. If the amount of <i>s'chach</i> which originally was kosher did not exceed [the branches], o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the presence of the branches remains halachically significant. Hence,...</i>ne must move them after detaching them, so that they will have been put in place for the purpose of a <i>sukkah</i>."

If one mixed a substance which may be used for <i>s'chach</i> with a substance that may not be used for <i>s'chach</i> a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This may refer to a substance like metal, which is unfit for use as <i>s'chach</i> because it does not grow in the earth, or branches of a tree which have not been detached from their source of nurture.</i>nd used the two as <i>s'chach</i>, even though the quantity of kosher <i>s'chach</i> exceeds that of the substance which was not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, [t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The presence of the substance which is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is not nullified according to the principles of ברב ביטול, because it exists as a separate entity which can be distinguished from the kosher <i>s'chach</i>.</p>
<p>Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, notes the apparent contradiction between this decision and Halachah 3, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[When one uses] branches from a fig tree which contain figs,...We see if the waste is more than the food; then we may use them as <i>s'chach</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

[In all these cases,] if there are four cubits [or more] from the edge of the kosher <i>s'chach</i> until the wall, it is not acceptable. If there is less than that amount, we view it as though the wall has been made crooked - i.e., the substance that is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is considered part of the wall and it is kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the sukkah as a whole is kosher, one may not eat or sleep under the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> if it is four handbreadths or more in size (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.). The rationale behind this decision is that the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> is considered to be part of the wall and not part of the <i>s'chach</i>.</i>. This concept is a halachah received by Moses on Mount Sinai."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.15","What is a small sukkah?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> referred to in the previous two halachot and in Halachah 20</i> Any [sukkah] whose area is no more than seven handbreadths by seven handbreadths.<br>[What is meant by] a large one? Any [sukkah] [whose area is large enough] that seven handbreadths by seven handbreadths of kosher <i>s'chach</i> will remain besides the <i>s'chach</i> which is not acceptable."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.16","If one used as <i>s'chach</i> substances that were acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> and substances that were not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, and placed them alongside each other, leaving no place with non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> more than three handbreadths in area, [t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> so that even in a small sukkah, all the conditions mentioned in the above halachot are met, there is a further requirement before the sukkah is considered kosher.</i>he following rules apply:]<br>If the total of the kosher <i>s'chach</i> exceeds that of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, it is kosher. If there was an exactly equal amount of both substances, it is not acceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This decision has raised questions from all authorities. Though the Rambam's decision is based on <i>Sukkah</i> 15a, <i>Eruvin</i> 15b states that a divider whose open portion is as great as its closed portion is considered to be a divider. Indeed, the Rambam himself quotes that decision in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:16. If so, why does he not follow the same principle in this instance as well?</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's decision is based on the fact that there is no way that there will not be some tiny open spaces within the kosher <i>s'chach</i> of a sukkah. Accordingly, even if the kosher <i>s'chach</i> is equal in area to the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, the tiny spaces between the kosher <i>s'chach</i> will tip the balance in favor of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 631:8 quotes the Rambam's decision as halachah, but adds as a reason (a quote from Rabbenu Tam's text of <i>Sukkah</i> 15b): ""for it is impossible to be exact."" This implies that were it possible to know that the kosher <i>s'chach</i> is exactly equal to the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, it would be acceptable. See also commentary to Halachah 19.</i> even though there is not a single place which has three handbreadths [of non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>]. [This decision is rendered] because non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> is considered to be open space."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.17","If one spread a cloth above [the <i>s'chach</i>] o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for added shade (<i>Sukkah 1:3)</i></i>r spread one below it to catch [the leaves] which fall, it is unacceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The cloth nullifies the presence of the kosher s'chach above or below it.</p>
<p>(<i>Tosafot</i> explains that as long as the sukkah has sufficient <i>s'chach</i> without the cloth, the cloth will not necessarily nullify the presence of the kosher <i>s'chach</i>. However, the majority of the halachic authorities and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 629:19 do not accept this view.)</p>
<p>However, once the cloth is lifted away, the kosher <i>s'chach</i> is acceptable without any further activity. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 626:3.) Thus, a roof can be constructed to protect a sukkah from rain, provided it is removed while the sukkah is being used.</i>. If one spread it [under the <i>s'chach</i>] as a decoration, it is kosher. Similarly, if one covered the sukkah with <i>s'chach</i> as required by law and adorned it w<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach emphasizes how the <i>s'chach</i> should be set in place before the decorations. Otherwise, they could be considered as intervening substances.</i>ith various types of fruit, delicacies, and articles which hang from either the walls or the <i>s'chach</i> as a decoration, it is kosher."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.18","Sukkah decorations do not reduce its height<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., if the inner space of the sukkah is more than twenty cubits high and the sukkah is therefore not acceptable (Chapter 4, Halachah 1), the presence of the decorations is not considered significant to reduce that space to the legal requirements.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the sukkah is very low and the decorations reduce its inner space to less than ten handbreadths, it is still kosher. (See Halachah 2 with regard to branches.) They are considered to be part of the <i>s'chach</i>, and the space they take up is not taken into account (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Manoach).</i>, but they do reduce its width.<br>If the sukkah decorations are four handbreadths or more<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as mentioned frequently above, four handbreadths constitutes a significant space</i> removed from the roof, it is unacceptable, because it is as though a person who sits there is not sitting under the <i>s'chach</i>, but rather under the decorations, which are foods and utensils that are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.19","The [following rules apply when the] <i>s'chach</i> has open spaces through which the sky can be seen: If the area of the open spaces is equivalent to t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and of course, if it is more than</i>hat of the space covered by <i>s'chach</i>, it is not acceptable, because the portion exposed to the sun will be greater than the shaded portion<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 22b explains that light spreads out. Accordingly, even though on the roof the portion covered by <i>s'chach</i> is equal to the uncovered portion, on the ground the area exposed to the sun will be greater than the shaded area. See also the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1.</i>. Whenever the portion exposed to the sun is greater than the shaded portion, it is not considered as <i>s'chach</i>.<br>If the <i>s'chach</i> exceeds the open space, it is kosher."

If a person attacked a colleague, forced him to leave his sukkah, stole it, and dwelled in it, the attacker has fulfilled his obligation, because landed property cannot be stolen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 8:14 relates that ""landed property is never acquired by a thief, but rather remains in the possession of its owner forever.""</p>
<p>Since the sukkah is built on the land, it is considered part of the property and the above rule applies to it as well. Thus, the sukkah is still considered to be the property of its original owner and the thief is viewed as merely ""borrowing"" the sukkah from him. As mentioned above, use of a borrowed sukkah is permitted.</i>.<br>[Similarly,] if he stole wood and made a sukkah from it, he has fulfilled his obligation, because the Sages ordained that the owner of the wood is entitled only to the monetary worth of the wood<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but not the wood itself. Thus, the sukkah itself is the property of the thief. Though he is obligated to pay the owner for his wood, that obligation does not prevent the sukkah from being considered as his.</p>
<p><i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 1:5 explains this principle by stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who steals is obligated to return the stolen property itself... If it was lost or changed, he is obligated to return its monetary value...</p>
<p>Even if one steals a beam and builds a mansion [using it], since [the beam] has not been changed, the Torah law would require him to destroy the entire building and return the beam to its owner.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Sages instituted a decree [to encourage] those who repent; they ordained that all that is necessary is for him to return [the beam's] monetary value, and thus he will not forfeit his building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach asks: Since the mitzvah of sukkah is commanded by the Torah, and Torah law regards these boards as stolen, how can the Sages' decree change their status in this context?</p>
<p>He explains that, as implied by the principle הפקר הפקר בית דין, the Torah has granted the Sages the right to determine the status of property. Their decree can alter entirely a person's rights to its title. Thus, in the present case, since Rabbinic law entitles the thief to use of the boards, he is permitted, according to Torah law, to use them as a Sukkah.</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (637:5) writes that if the thief refuses to pay for the wood, it is considered to be the property of its original owner, and the thief does not fulfill his obligation.</i>. Even if one stole boards and merely put them in place without attaching them or changing anything about them, he has fulfilled his obligation.<br>If a person constructs his sukkah in the public domain<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the Jewish inhabitants of the city would surely not object to use of public property for this purpose, the gentile inhabitants of the city would. Since they also have a share in this property, building a sukkah there is equivalent to stealing from the public (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 637:3).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, since the theft of land is involved...</i>, it is acceptable."
Blessings 10.1,"The Sages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Chapter 1, Halachah 5, the Rambam attributed the composition of the text of all the blessings to Ezra and his court, the <i>Anshei K'nesset Hagedolah</i>.</i> instituted other blessings and many other statements<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachot 19-25.</i> that lack a <i>p'tichah</i> and a <i>chatimah</i>, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The words, ""Blessed are You, God,"" which are used to conclude blessings.

Among these [blessings are the following]:<br>A person who builds a new house or buys<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 223:4) states that the blessing should be recited when the article is purchased, and not when it is first used. One feels greater satisfaction when purchasing the article than when using it.</i> new articles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the Rambam, this refers to articles acquired through inheritance. If one has already purchased such an article, he should not recite a blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:3, based on the decisions of Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher), however, states that the blessing should be recited even when he had purchased such articles before.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., garments or household goods (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 223:13). This blessing should be recited only on the acquisition of important articles, whose purchase brings one considerable satisfaction. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:6) and <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> should recite the blessing: ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, who has granted us life, sustained us, and enabled us to reach this occasion."" [This blessing is recited] regardless of whether he possesses similar articles or not."
Blessings 10.2,"Similarly, a person who sees a friend<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 58b, states that this refers to a friend who is dear and whose sight brings one satisfaction.</i> after [not seeing him for] thirty days [or more]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thirty days is considered a significant period regarding various matters of Scriptural Law.</i> should recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> .

Blessings 10.3,"When a person hears favorable tidings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah is complemented by Halachah 7, which explains that the blessing <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i> is recited when the positive nature of the tidings effect others as well as oneself. If the favorable tidings are individual in nature, the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> should be recited. The Rambam mentions <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i> in this halachah, because he is referring to - although not quoting exactly - the text of the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 9:2.</i>, he should recite the blessing: ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who is good and does good."" If he hears bad tidings, he should recite the blessing: ""Blessed [are You...] the true Judge<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing has the implication that, although one personally feels upset over the event, he realizes that since everything is controlled by God and He is ""the true Judge"":</p>
<p>a) the occurrence, however tragic, was just,<br/>
b) ultimately, it is intended for the good.

[This is implied by Deuteronomy 6:5]: ""And you shall love God, your Lord... with all your might.""

Thus, the mitzvah to love God includes this ""extra dimension of love.""</i> is to acknowledge and praise [God] with happiness even at one's time of difficulty."
Blessings 3.1,"There are five species [of grain]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As will be explained, there are special laws regarding the blessings recited before and after food made from these species of grain. These five species are also mentioned in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:1.</i>: wheat, barley, rye<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the accepted translation. There is some difficulty, however, in accepting it, since rye was not commonly grown in the Mediterranean region. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Kilayim</i> 1:1, the Rambam defines כוסמין as ""wild wheat.""</i>, oats, and spelt<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that this grain resembles כוסמין. [For this reason, there are commentaries which interchange the translations of כוסמין and שיפון.]</i>. Rye is a sub-species of wheat, and oats and spelt are sub-species of barley.<br>When these five species are in their stalks, they are referred to as <i>tevuah</i>. After they have been threshed and winnowed, they are referred to as grain. W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, also, although these statements have other halachic implications (e.g., <i>Challah</i> 1:2 mentions these points within the context of vows: if a person vows not to benefit from <i>tevuah</i> or grain, he is forbidden to benefit from these species), the Rambam is defining these terms here because he will refer to them throughout this chapter.</i>hen they have been milled and their flour kneaded and baked, they are referred to as bread. Bread made from these species is referred to as bread without any additional modifier."
Blessings 3.2,"Before eating bread<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> made from the five species of grain mentioned in the previous halachah</i>, a person should recite the blessing, ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who brings forth bread from the earth."" Afterwards, he should recite the four blessings [of grace]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> discussed in the previous chapter.</i>.<br>Before eating kernels of grain that have been cooked without being processed, a person should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>. A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the blessing recited for eating vegetables and other products of the earth (Chapter 8, Halachah 1).</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 37a states, ""A person who chews [kernels of] wheat should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>."" Even though the grain has been cooked, since the kernels were not processed at all, it does not warrant a blessing of greater importance (<i>Kessef Mishnah</i>).</p>
<p>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:3-6 discusses the question of grains that are cooked whole, but are cooked for a long period until their shell dissolves. There are authorities who recommend that unless the kernels have been cooked to the extent that they stick together as a single mass, whole grains should be eaten only in the midst of a meal containing bread. See also Halachah 4.</i>fterwards, he should recite the blessing <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i>. Before eating flour<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which has not been cooked</i>, a person should recite the blessing <i>shehakol</i>. Afterwards, he should recite the blessing <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i>."
Blessings 3.9,"Before partaking of dough baked over the ground<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Significantly, the Rambam's definition of the term כובא דארעא, discussed by our Sages, <i>Berachot</i> 38a, differs from that of Rashi, whose interpretation is quoted in the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:15).</i> as is baked by the Arabs living in the desert, one should recite the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>, b<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and not <i>hamotzi</i></i>ecause it does not have the appearance of bread. If, however, one uses it as the basis of a meal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Based on <i>Berachot</i> 42a, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:6) interprets this to mean ""a measure that others would usually use as the basis for a meal even though, personally, one is not satisfied from it.""</p>
<p>Quantitatively, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 168:8 states that the intention is a full meal, an <i>isaron</i>. [He arrives at this calculation as follows: In the desert, the Jews received an <i>omer</i> of manna for two meals each day. An <i>omer</i> is twice the quantity of an <i>isaron</i>.] This is approximately 22 <i>k'beitzot</i>, or 1266 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 1452 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>. This figure includes not only the grain product, but also other foods - e.g., meat, fish, or vegetables - that are eaten together with it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are more stringent opinions, and accordingly, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 168:24 suggest not eating a meal consisting of more than four <i>k'beitzot</i> of food with such ""bread"" as its base.</i>, one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.<br>Similar [laws apply to] dough that was kneaded with honey, oil, or milk<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:7) states that all that is necessary is to mix enough of these ingredients into the dough so that their taste is felt. The Ramah and the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:16 differ and maintain that the amount of these ingredients must exceed the quantity of water used. Support for their ruling can be drawn from the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:20.</p>
<p>The above is significant with regard to what is popularly called today <i>mezonot</i> bread, which is produced by using apple juice instead of (or together with) water. According to the Ramah, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should not be recited:<br/>
a) if the dough is made with more water than juice,<br/>
 b) if one uses this bread as the basis for a large meal.</i>, or mixed together with different condiments and baked<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> producing a product which, like cake, is generally eaten for pleasure and not as the basis of a meal.</i>. It is referred to as <i>pat haba'ah b'kisnin</i>. Although it [resembles] bread, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> is recited over it. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because it is not food which, like bread, is the foundation of our diets.</i>f, however, one uses it as the basis of a meal, one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>."
Blessings 3.10,"Before eating rice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this halachah, we have translated אורז as ""rice"" and דוחן as ""millet,"" based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shvi'it</i> 2:7. There is, however, debate concerning this manner among the halachic authorities. Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 37a) and the Maharil interpret אורז as ""millet."" With respect to these opinions, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 208:9 and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 208:11 suggest partaking of rice or millet only in the midst of a meal including bread. If either are eaten separately, the blessing <i>shehakol</i> should be recited beforehand because of the doubt involved.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <i>Sha'ar Tziyun</i> 208:31 rules that the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited before partaking of rice. He explains that there are opinions that the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited on all satisfying food.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.1,"It is a positive commandment of the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> — <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 21)</i> to relate the miracles and wonders wrought for our ancestors in Egypt on the night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.), the Rambam states ""the beginning of the night,"" implying that we should begin telling the story of the Exodus in the first portion of the night.</i> of the fifteenth of Nisan, as [Exodus 13:3] states: ""Remember this day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the fifteenth of Nisan</i>, on which you left Egypt,"" just as [Exodus 20:8] states: ""Remember the Sabbath day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This addition is a quote from the <i>Mechiltah</i> and <i>Shemot Rabbah</i>. Nevertheless, the commentators have questioned its necessity. Some explain that the word זכור does not follow the grammatical form usually used for commandments, and hence the comparison with the Sabbath is valuable.</p>
<p><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 21, explains that <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> states that the remembrance of the Sabbath is זכר למעשה בראשית, ""a commemoration of the work of creation."" The remembrance of the exodus, it continues, must also emphasize the wonders and miracles that God performed.</p>
<p>What is the common point between the Sabbath and the exodus? Both emphasize how God is above nature and, hence, can change nature according to His will.</p>
<p>This quality is also reflected in our service. At the very beginning of <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how the observance of the Sabbath is connected with a positive mitzvah: rest. A Jew steps beyond his weekday activities and devotes his energies to spiritual activites bond with God.</p>
<p>Similarly, the recollection of the exodus from Egypt must take us beyond our everyday activities to the extent that as stated in Halachah 7:6 ""He presents himself as if he, himself, is leaving the slavery of Egypt.""</i>.""<br>From where [is it derived that this mitzvah is to be fulfilled on] the night of the fifteenth?

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.4,"One must begin [the narrative describing our ancestors'] base [roots] and conclude with [their] praise<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This principle is taken from the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a. The commentaries offer several rationales in its explanation. Among them:</p>
<p>a) The contrast between our nation's humble roots and the majestic level they reached through the Exodus make us more conscious of God's great kindness (<i>Tosefot Rid</i>).</p>
<p>b) Mention of our roots prevents us from becoming overly haughty (<i>Maharshah</i>).</i>. What does this imply? One begins relating how originally, in the age of Terach, our ancestors denied [God's existence]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam is alluding to the passage ""Originally, our ancestors were idol-worshipers.""</i> and strayed after vanity, pursuing idol worship. One concludes with the true faith<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The redemption from Egypt representing the birth of the Jews as a nation and the beginning of their service of God as a people.</i>: how the Omnipresent has drawn us close to Him, separated us from the gentiles, and drawn us near to His Oneness.<br>Similarly, one begins by stating that we were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and [describing] all the evil done to us<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 116a, which mentions a debate between Rav and Shmuel concerning the interpretation of ""One must begin [the narrative describing our ancestors'] base [roots] and conclude with [their] praise.""</p>
<p>Rav maintains that it is proper to begin from ""Originally, our ancestors were worshipers of idols,"" placing the emphasis on our degrading spiritual roots. Shmuel (according to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, Ravvah) maintains that we should begin from ""We were slaves to Pharaoh, stressing the humble material origins from which our people stem. Customarily, we follow both opinions in our recitation of the Haggadah (Rav Yitzchak Alfasi), and hence the Rambam includes both opinions in this halachah.</p>
<p>There is, nonetheless, a certain difficulty with the Rambam's statements. All texts of the Haggadah begin with ""We were slaves,"" and then relate the passage ""Originally, our ancestors were idol worshipers."" Here, the Rambam reverses that order. Perhaps he made this choice because the Talmud uses this order when mentioning these two opinions. Alternatively, chronologically, our ancestors' worship of idols preceded the Egyptian exile.</i>, and concludes with the miracles and wonders that were wrought upon us, and our freedom.<br>This [implies] that one should extrapolate<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> bringing other verses to explain and clarify the statements of this passage as found in the Haggadah.</i> [the passage beginning] from [Deuteronomy 26:5]: ""An Aramean sought to destroy my ancestor..."" until one concludes the entire passage<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., until Deuteronomy 26:8.</i>.

Nevertheless, the Rambam's text of the Mishnah and the Haggadah do not include that verse.</i>."" Regarding this manner, God commanded in the Torah: ""Remember that you were a slave [Deuteronomy 5:15]"" - i.e., as if you, yourself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even though physically, you did not experience this slavery.</i>, were a slave and went out to freedom and were redeemed."

<p>The Ramah qualifies this law, explaining that since, in the Ashkenazic community, certain opinions do not require reclining at present, one need not drink another cup of wine if the third and fourth cups of wine were drunk without reclining. However, he suggests that a person repeat the eating of matzah and the drinking of the first two cups of wine if they were consumed without reclining.

</blockquote>
<p>A change of opinion of this nature is not extremely uncommon. However, the question can be raised: why does the Rambam not require a blessing to be recited over the <i>charoset</i>? Among the answers given is that the <i>charoset</i> is considered secondary (טפל) to the substances which are dipped in it. Hence, we follow the principle of reciting a blessing upon the essential item (the maror or the matzah) and not on the <i>charoset</i> (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).</i>o commemorate the clay with which [our forefathers] worked in Egypt<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> making bricks.</i>.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.12,"According to the Torah, the eating of bitter herbs is not a mitzvah in its own right<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In contrast to matzah, concerning which there is a separate commandment (Exodus 12:18 : ""On that evening, eat matzot,"" there is no specific Biblical commandment to eat bitter herbs alone.</p>

<p>כזית. That measure is required only according to the Sages, who established a separate mitzvah to eat maror. Therefore, as in all other cases where eating is required, one must consume a כזית. However, since there is no Torah mitzvah to eat maror, merely that one should use it to embellish the Paschal sacrifice, that measure is not required by the Torah.</p>
<p>[Perhaps, this thesis may be questioned on the basis of Halachah 8:6, which requires a separate blessing for maror when it is eaten alone.

<p>Furthermore, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 56), the Rambam explains that if it is impossible to obtain bitter herbs, it is still a mitzvah to partake of the Paschal sacrifice. However, there is no mitzvah to partake of bitter herbs alone. (See also <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 8:2.)</i>. According to the words of the Sages, [it is a mitzvah] to eat the bitter herbs alone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in contrast to our practice of eating them together with matzah (see Halachah 8:8), which is only a custom</i> on this night even if there is no Paschal sacrifice."

Fasts 1.1,"It is a positive Torah commandment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 59), which mentions this in the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</p>
<p>Significantly, however, the Rambam's appreciation of this mitzvah differs in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. To explain: Following the verse quoted here by the Rambam as a proof-text, the Torah continues [Numbers 10:10]: ""On the days of your rejoicing, on your festivals, and on your new moon [celebrations], you shall sound the trumpets for your burnt offerings and for your peace offerings.""</p>
<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are commanded to sound the trumpets in the Temple when offering sacrifices that are offered only at appointed times.... [Also,] we are commanded to sound the trumpets at a time of distress and difficulty when we pray to Him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (and similarly in <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 384), the emphasis of the mitzvah is clearly on the sounding of the trumpets during the sacrifices. In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, when listing the 613 mitzvot at the beginning of the text, the Rambam mentions the sounding of the trumpets both for the sacrifices and in times of distress. Nevertheless, further on in the beginning of the text, when delineating the mitzvot according to subjects, he places the emphasis on crying out to God at a time of distress (seemingly, including crying out verbally and crying out with the trumpets in the same mitzvah). Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 3, where the Rambam mentions the practice of sounding the trumpets in connection with the offering of the sacrifices, he does not mention it as a component of this or any other specific mitzvah.</p>
<p>(Note also the commentary of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, which questions why these two different rites were included as a single mitzvah at the outset. Even in the Torah, they are included in two separate verses.)</i> to cry out and to sound<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The verb להריע refers to the sounding of a series of staccato notes referred to as <i>teru'ah</i>. See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:2-4. Significantly, although in practice, both types of notes were sounded, with regard to the sounding of the trumpets at the offerings, the Torah uses the verb ותקעתם, which refers to sounding a <i>teki'ah</i>, a single long note.</i> trumpets in the event of any difficulty that arises which affects the community, as [Numbers 10:9] states: ""[When you go out to war... against] an enemy who attacks you and you sound the trumpets....""<br>[T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As obvious from Halachah 4, this practice was observed throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and not only in the Temple. Nor is its observance dependent on the existence of the Temple, nor does the Rambam specify that it must be fulfilled only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (In this regard, there are differing opinions; see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:1) Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:1 questions: Why is the rite of sounding the trumpets (or shofarot) not observed at present?</p>
<p>The resolution of this question lies in the Rambam's words, ""any difficulty that arises which affects the community."" This rite should not be observed when an individual, or even a group of individuals, are in distress, but only when a ""community"" is affected.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> 54b explains that communal fasts are possible only within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There is no concept of taking such a unified communal act of this nature in the diaspora. Therefore, this mitzvah was not relevant in all the generations of our people's existence in the diaspora. (See also the <i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i> of the Ramban.)</p>
<p>A question arises, however, with regard to the situation at present, with the renewal of the Jewish settlement in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 11, there are opinions (see the gloss of the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> to the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575) that maintain that at present, the concept of community also applies in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</p>
<p>According to this view, without entering into the discussion regarding the halachic status of the present government, it would appear that it would be proper for this mitzvah to be observed, since its observance is not dependent on the Temple.</i>his commandment is not restricted to such a limited scope; rather] the intent is: Whenever you are distressed by difficulties - e.g., famine, plague<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b, which states that the trumpets should not be sounded in the case of a plague even during the week. Since a plague is a very severe matter, were the trumpets to be sounded during the week, they might also be sounded when a plague took place on the Sabbath, and thus a prohibition would be violated. The Rambam discusses this question in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:3). Similarly, in Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Rambam rules that the trumpets are sounded when a plague occurs.</i>, locusts, or the like - cry out [to God] because of them and sound the trumpets."
Fasts 1.2,"This practice is one of the paths of repentance<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Temurah</i>, where the Rambam writes that although all the mitzvot of the Torah are Divine decrees and thus unfathomable in nature, we should meditate upon them and, to the fullest extent of our potential, try to explain them. Similarly, with regard to the mitzvah under discussion, without claiming to be able to fathom it in its entirety, the Rambam gives a rational explanation for the practice.</i>, for when a difficulty arises, and the people cry out [to God] and sound the trumpets, everyone will realize that [the difficulty] occurred because of their evil conduct, as [Jeremiah 5:25] states: ""Your sins have turned away [the rains and the harvest climate]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 9:1, where the Rambam explains that God has instituted a cycle of causation into the world in which performing a mitzvah brings an individual - or a community - blessing and prosperity, which enable them to perform more mitzvot. Conversely, the failure to observe mitzvot brings about misfortune, which, in turn, makes it even harder to observe mitzvot.</i>."" This [realization] will cause the removal of this difficulty."
Fasts 1.3,"Conversely, should the people fail to cry out [to God] and sound the trumpets, and instead say, ""What has happened to us is merely a natural phenomenon and this difficulty is merely a chance occurrence,"" this is a cruel conception of things, which causes them to remain attached to their wicked deeds<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for they refuse to pay attention to the external cues God gives to motivate repentance.</i>. Thus, this time of distress will lead to further distresses.<br>This is implied by the Torah's statement [Leviticus 26:27-28]: ""If you remain indifferent to Me, I will be indifferent to you with a vengeance."" The implication of the verse is: When I bring difficulties upon you so that you shall repent and you say it is a chance occurrence, I will add to your [punishment] an expression of vengeance for that indifference [to Divine Providence].<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rather than seeing their difficulty as part of a Divinely structured plan to motivate their repentance.</i>"
Fasts 1.4,"In addition<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to the obligation to cry out and sound the trumpets incumbent upon us from the Torah</i>, it is a Rabbinic ordinance to fast whenever there is a difficulty that affects the community<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These difficulties are listed in Chapter 2.</i> until there is a manifestation of Divine mercy.<br>On these fast days, we cry out in prayer, offer supplications, and sound the trumpets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> blow a series of <i>teru'ah</i> notes</i> only. In the Temple, we sound both the trumpets and the shofar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the Mishnah (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 3:3), it would appear that two shofarot were sounded together (<i>Minchat Chinuch</i>).</i>. The shofar blasts should be shortened and the trumpet blasts extended, for the mitzvah of the day is with the trumpets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the contrast to <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 1:2.</i>. The trumpets are sounded together with the shofar only in the Temple, as [can be inferred from Psalms 98:6]: ""Sound trumpets and shofar blasts before God, the King."""
Fasts 1.5,"These fasts ordained for the community because of difficulties should not be consecutive<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> day after day.</i>, for the community would not be able to observe such a practice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> And an ordinance for the community is not instituted unless it is possible for the majority of the community to observe it (<i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 2:5). Were a communal ordinance that could not be observed by the majority of the community to be instituted, the people's observance, not only of that particular ordinance, but of the Torah as a whole, would be weakened.</i>.<br>A communal fast should be ordained only on a Monday, on the subsequent Thursday, and on the subsequent Monday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Mondays and Thursdays are days associated with significant spiritual influences. Also, in this manner, the fasts are separated from each other and from the Sabbath.</p>
<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:9), the Rambam explains that communal fasts should be held first on Mondays, because were they to be held on Thursday, the shopkeepers would assume that the possibilities for famine are great - for otherwise why would a public fast be instituted before the Sabbath - and they would raise the prices of foodstuffs.</p>
<p>(This rationale differs slightly from Rashi's interpretation of the Mishnah. Significantly, many of the traditional commentaries on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> do not mention the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah. See the <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>.)</i>. This pattern - Monday, Thursday, Monday - should be followed until [God manifests His] mercies."
Fasts 1.6,"A communal fast should not be decreed on a Sabbath, nor on a festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<p>The <i>Merchevat HaMishneh HaSefaradit</i> raises a question regarding this statement. From the previous halachah, it would appear that a communal fast is ordained only on Mondays and Thursdays, and from this halachah one might assume that, since it is necessary to exclude the Sabbath, such a fast might be ordained for other days.</p>
<p>In resolution, it is explained that the previous halachah refers only to the thirteen communal fasts instituted when the rains fail to descend. When a difficulty of another nature arises, a fast may be instituted on a day other than Monday or Thursday. Alternatively, it can be explained that if the difficulty is not a matter of immediate emergency, the fast is put off for a Monday, as mentioned above. In the case of an immediate emergency, however, a fast may be held on any day other than those mentioned in this and the following halachah.</i>. On these days, neither a shofar nor a trumpet should be sounded, nor do we cry out [to God] or offer supplications in prayer.<br>The [only] exceptions are<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See also Chapter 2, Halachah 2, which states that we should cry out in prayer, even on the Sabbath, if our source of sustenance is threatened.</i> a city surrounded by gentiles or a [flooding] river and a ship that is sinking at sea.

According to the authorities who maintain that we may fast on the Sabbath (and even according to some who forbid fasting), this refers to the blessing <i>Anenu</i> added to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>). According to the other opinions, it refers to the seven blessings mentioned in Chapter 4 that begin ""May He who answered... answer you"" (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>. [The trumpets] should not be sounded for them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as an expression of prayer to arouse God's mercies.</i>, however, unless they are being sounded to gather together the people to help them and [try to] save them."
Fasts 1.7,"Similarly, at the outset, a fast should not be ordained on Rosh Chodesh<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi (<i>Ta'anit</i> 15b) cites Numbers 10:10 as an indication that Rosh Chodesh is described as ""a festival.""

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 572:2) quotes the Rambam's ruling.</i>. If, however, the community has begun to fast because of a distressing situation for even a single day, and the schedule of fasts requires that a fast be held on one of the days mentioned above, we should fast, and [indeed,] fast for the entire day."
Fasts 1.8,"Pregnant women, nursing women<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest their fetus or child be endangered by the lack of nourishment.</i>, and children need not fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nevertheless, as mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, they should not indulge in food and drink for the sake of pleasure.</i> on communal fasts that are instituted because of difficulties of this nature.<br>[With regard to these fasts,] even though we are required to fast during the day, we are allowed to eat on [the preceding] night, with the exception of the fasts instituted for [a lack of] rain, as will be explained<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in Chapter 3, Halachot 3 and 5.</i>. Whenever we are allowed to eat on the night of a fast, whether a communal fast or an individual fast, a person is allowed to eat until dawn, provided he does not sleep. If he goes to sleep, he may not eat after arising."
Fasts 1.9,"Just as the community should fast because of distress, so too, each in<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i> in</i>dividual should fast [when confronted by] distress<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this as an obligation. Not only is fasting advisable for a person as a means to secure Divine favor, it is an obligation incumbent upon him.</i>. What is implied? When an individual to whom a person [feels close] is sick, lost in the desert, or imprisoned, one should fast for his sake<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Significantly, the Rambam mentions fasting on behalf of another person. Surely, one should fast for one's own sake if that is possible. In many situations, however, were a person who confronts distress to fast, he would lack the strength to cope with the crisis he is facing. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 571:3.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <i>Ta'anit</i> 8b gives advice regarding such a situation as well, counselling one to vow to fast in the future. This will be considered as if the person fasted already, as implied by Daniel 10:12, ""From the day on which you first <i>considered</i>... fasting before your Lord, your words were heeded.""</i>, ask for mercy for him in prayer, and say [the passage] <i>Anenu</i> in all the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> prayers recited [that day]. One should not fast on the Sabbath, on festivals, on Rosh Chodesh, on Chanukah, or on Purim."
Fasts 1.10,"Whenever an individual did not accept a fast [on the previous day] before sunset, it is not considered to be a fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 12a describes a person who fasts without having made such a commitment to be ""a bellows full of air"" - i.e., he receives no reward for refraining from eating. Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who questions why such a person does not receive at least the reward of an hourly fast, as mentioned in Halachah 13.</p>
<p>He explains that since the person desired his fast to be considered as a full day fast, it is impossible for him to receive the merit of an hourly fast. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 562:42.)</i>.<br>How does one accept a fast? After reciting the afternoon prayers, one states, ""Tomorrow I will fast,"" and resolves to do so<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the Rambam's statements, it appears that a mental resolve is not sufficient. This is borne out by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 563:1). Note the ruling of the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 563:3, which state that, after the fact, it is sufficient to have made a mental resolve for one's commitment to fast to be binding.</i>. Although one eats at night, this does not detract from one's commitment to fast.<br>Similarly, if one resolved to fast for three or four days consecutively and accepts such a fast upon oneself, the fact that one eats each night does not detract from his fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> provided that in the daylight hours one refrains from eating.</i>. It is unnecessary for him to state his intent on the afternoon before each succeeding day."
Fasts 1.12,"A person who has a disturbing dream must fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the Rambam sees this as an obligation. Other authorities differ, as mentioned in the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:18.</i> on the following day, so that he will be motivated to improve his conduct, inspect his deeds, and turn [to God] in repentance.<br>He should undertake such a fast even on the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 31b states that a person who fasts on the Sabbath will cause a decree of seventy years standing against him to be rent.</p>
<p><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 288:3 explains that such a person is allowed to fast on the Sabbath, because the disturbing nature of his dream will prevent him from appreciating the Sabbath pleasures. It is fasting and not indulgence that will bring such a person satisfaction.</p>
<p>Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 288:5) explains that at present, it is customary to fast on the Sabbath only for certain disturbing dreams, since we are not as aware of the proper interpretation of dreams as were the Sages of the previous generations.</i>, reciting the passage <i>Anenu</i> in each of the prayer services. [This applies] even though he did not resolve on the previous day to fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the only exception to the rule mentioned in Halachah 10. The positive influences aroused by fasting are most effective immediately after the disturbing dream (<i>Ta'anit</i> 12b).</i>.<br>When a person fasts on the Sabbath, he must fast on another day as well, [to atone for] nullifying [the mitzvah of indulging in] pleasurable activities on the Sabbath."
Fasts 1.13,"A person may fast for several hours<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., although a person did not undertake a full day fast, the fact that he refrains from eating for several hours can be considered to be a fast. Although his merit is less than that of a person who undertakes and completes a full day fast, he still receives reward for his conduct.</i> - i.e., that he not eat anything for the remainder of a day. What is implied? A person was involved with his affairs and tended to his concerns without eating until noon or until three in the afternoon<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although the person actually fasted for the entire day, it is considered only an hourly fast, since he did not make a commitment on the previous day.</i>. Should he make a decision to fast for the remaining hours of the day, he should fast for that time and recite [the passage] <i>Anenu</i>, b<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in the afternoon service</i>ecause he accepted the fast before the hours of the fast. Similarly, if a person ate or drank and then began to fast for the entire day, it is considered to be a fast for several hours."
Fasts 1.16,"When a community is fasting for the sake of rain, and it begins to rain before noon, the people should not complete their fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This teaching, quoted from the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:9), conveys an important lesson. We must always be ready to praise God for His mercies and to do so with joy.</i>.

For example, the people were fasting for the recovery of a sick person and he died.</i>f this occurred] before noon, they need not complete their fast; after noon, they should complete their fast."
Sabbath 9.4,"When one person brought fire, another brought wood<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's ruling is based on <i>Beitzah</i> 34a and the <i>Tosefta, Shabbat</i> 12:4. There are, however, slight differences between the wording chosen by the Rambam and the wording of those sources. Furthermore, the Talmud implies that the person who brought the fire is liable, not for performing a derivative of the labor of cooking, but for the labor of kindling. (See Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) This is definitely not the Rambam's intent.</p>
<p>In resolution of this difficulty, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes his teacher, Rav Ya'akov bei Rav, who explains that the first clause describes a situation in which all the individuals performed their act virtually simultaneously, with a shared intent. Hence, since the end result of their activity is the performance of a forbidden labor, all are held liable as if they had performed the labor themselves.</i>, another brought a pot, another added water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even those who do not accept the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> would hold such a person liable, since a person is liable for heating water, as explained in Halachah 1.</i>, another put in meat, another put in spices<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></p>
<p>If, by contrast, one put down the pot, another came - According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this is the key phrase in understanding the difference between the first clause and the second. ""Another came"" - i.e., he came after, and without any connection, to the first individual. Hence, the responsibility is not shared by the entire group. Accordingly, since the actions of the persons mentioned first could not bring about cooking in their own right, they are not held liable.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the spices contribute flavor to the food, adding them to the pot is sufficient to make one liable for cooking, even according to the opinions that do not accept the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.</i>, and another stirred it, all are liable for cooking. For anyone who performs an activity that is necessary for cooking is considered as [having performed that forbidden labor].<br>If, by contrast, one put down the pot, another came and added water, another came and added meat, another came and added spices, another came and brought fire, another came and placed wood on the fire<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Once the wood begins to burn, the fire will have the potential to cook the meat. Hence, the person who brings it is liable.</i>, and another came and stirred, it is only the latter two who are liable for cooking."

Blessings 2.2,"When workers are employed by an employer and eat a meal of bread, they should not recite a blessing before eating<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The obligation to recite the blessing before eating is Rabbinic in origin. In certain situations, the Sages did not institute such a requirement.</i>. Similarly, they should recite only two blessings after eating so that they do not neglect their employer's work<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From this we learn two concepts:<br/>
a) that it is forbidden to work while reciting grace (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 2:5; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 183:12);<br/>
b) how important it is for a worker to devote himself faithfully to his work.

This view is not shared by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and several other commentaries, who point to the fact that neither <i>Berachot</i> 49a nor the Rambam explicitly mentions God's sovereignty. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) shares the <i>Lechem Mishneh's</i> position.</i> who has granted rest to His people Israel as a sign and a holy covenant.

On the festivals: Blessed [are You, God...] who has granted festivals to His people Israel for rejoicing and for happiness.

<p><i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions that the Sages were unsure of whether this blessing should include a <i>chatimah</i> or not.

The difference between the two is that prayer is an obligation, while eating a meal of bread is not. Since there is no obligation to recite grace on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>, failing to mention it in grace is not sufficient cause to warrant its repetition.</i>.

Whoever performs a deed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., in his curiosity, uncovers an image to see what it looks like (Maharshal) or performs a ceremonial act of idol worship merely as practice (<i>Mishneh Kessef</i>).</p>
<p>The Rambam's statements here are used as support to negate the opinion of the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 345), which states that lashes are never given for the violation of a prohibition that can be transgressed without performing a deed, even when one violates it by committing a deed.</i> that reflects his concern with [idol worship] receives lashes [as punishment].<br>The worship of false gods is not the only subject to which we are forbidden to pay attention<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the Introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), which states that there are mitzvot of thought, of feeling, of speech, and of deed.</i>; rather, we are warned not to consider any thought which will cause us to uproot one of the fundamentals of the Torah. We should not turn our minds to these matters, think about them, or be drawn after the thoughts of our hearts.<br>In general, people have limited powers of understanding, and not all minds are capable of appreciating the truth in its fullness. [Accordingly,] were a person to follow the thoughts of his heart, it is possible that he would destroy the world because of his limited understanding<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are several ways to understand the expression used by the Rambam: ""destroy the world."" On the most obvious level, it is a figurative expression, not to be interpreted literally. On a deeper level, it can be seen as a reference to his statements in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:4 that a person should always ""see himself and the entire world as equally balanced between merit and sin. If he commits one sin, he tips his balance and that of the entire world to guilt and brings on destruction.""</p>
<p>Today, we can appreciate the Rambam's words in a very literal sense. Society as a whole is plagued by irrational acts of violence. and on a global level it is possible for utter destruction to be brought about if a few individuals act irresponsibly.</i>.<br>What is implied? There are times when a person will stray after star worship, and times when he will wonder about God's oneness: Perhaps He is one, perhaps He is not? [He might also wonder:] What exists above, [in the heavenly realms]? What exists below [them]? What was before time? What will be after time? Similarly, [one might wonder about] prophecy: Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not? And [one may also wonder] about the Torah: Perhaps it emanates from God, perhaps it does not?<br>Since he may not know the guidelines with which to evaluate [ideas that will lead him] to the truth in its fullness, he may come to heresy. The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: ""Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality"" - i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Instead, he should follow a structured pattern for intellectual growth and development prescribed by a Torah master.</i>.<br>Our Sages [interpreted this warning]: ""After your hearts,"" this refers to heresy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For a more precise definition of the term <i>minut</i>, see Halachah 5 and the commentary.</i>; ""after your eyes,"" this refers to immorality. This prohibition - though [severe,] causing a person to be prevented [from attaining a portion] in the world to come<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam includes among the categories of those who have no portion in the world to come: ""nonbelievers, heretics, those who deny the Torah,... those who cause the many to sin, and those who depart from the ways of the community."" Following the whims of one's heart can lead to the transgression of these prohibitions.</i> - is not punishable by lashes."
Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.4,"The commandment [forbidding] the worship of false gods is equivalent to all the mitzvot, as [implied by Numbers 15:22]: ""Lest you err and not perform all the mitzvot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The passage implies that it is speaking about a single sin; nevertheless, the verse specifically mentions ""all the mitzvot.""</i>....""

<p>As the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Purim</i>, Chapter 2, ""happiness"" is associated with feasting. In this context, the <i>Yam shel Shlomo, Bava Kama</i> 7:37, explains that according to the Rambam - in contrast to the rulings of the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 670:2) - the festive meals customarily served on Chanukah can be considered to be feasts associated with a mitzvah.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 21b states that the celebration of the holiday was ordained in the year following the miracle.</i> ordained that these eight days, which begin from the twenty-fifth of Kislev, should be commemorated to be days of happiness and praise [of God]. Candles should be lit in the evening at the entrance to the houses on each and every one of these eight nights to publicize and reveal the miracle<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Both factors, the kindling of the Chanukah candles at night - when their light could be seen - and their placement at the entrance to the house - where their light will be projected into the street - emphasize the principle of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle.</i>.<br>These days are called Chanukah. It is forbidden to eulogize and fast on them, as on the days of Purim<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 13, the prohibition to eulogize and fast applies only on the days of Chanukah themselves, and not on the preceding or succeeding days.</p>
<p>Significantly, unlike Purim, there is no prohibition against work on Chanukah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 670:1).</i>. Lighting the candles on these days is a Rabbinic mitzvah, like the reading of the Megillah."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.6,"It is not the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on Chanukah alone that is a Rabbinic ordinance, b<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since Chanukah is a Rabbinic holiday, one might think that the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on those days is Rabbinic in origin, while the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on the festivals has its source in the Torah itself.

T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rosh HaShanah is a day of happiness.

The [Sages] did not ordain the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on Purim, because the reading of the Megillah [serves the purpose of <i>Hallel</i>]."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.8,"And how should one skip<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> when reciting <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh and the latter days of Pesach?</i>?

A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although <i>Hallel</i> is recited directly after the morning service, it is not an integral part of the prayer service and may be recited at other times. See <i>Megillah</i> 20b, which derives an allusion to this concept from the exegesis of Psalms 118:24: ""This is the day which God wrought; let us rejoice and exult in it."" Our ""rejoicing and exultation,"" the recitation of <i>Hallel</i>, may be carried out throughout the entire day.</i> person who reads <i>Hallel</i> in improper sequence does not fulfill his obligation.

(See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.)</p>
<p>As mentioned in the commentary on that halachah, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 65:1) rules that should a person be forced to refrain from completing the <i>Shema</i> because the place in which he is located contains filth, he does not fulfill his obligation if he waited the amount of time required to recite the <i>Shema</i> in its entirety. The commentaries question if this law applies with regard to the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> as well. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 422:25.)</i>n the days when the entire <i>Hallel</i> is recited, one may make an interruption between chapters<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Seemingly, the Rambam does not consider the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> analogous to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> (see <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:15-16) and appears to allow all interruptions (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, however, is more restrictive and allows interruptions only when there is a need.</p>
<p>In their analysis of <i>Berachot</i> 14a (the source for this halachah), Rabbenu Asher and other commentaries differ and compare the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. Thus, one may greet an honored person between the chapters and may respond to a greeting from anyone at that time. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 488:1) follows this ruling.</i>. Within a [single] chapter, however, one may not make an interruption. On the days when <i>Hallel</i> is read while skipping portions, o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Eliyahu Rabba</i> explains that the Rambam's ruling depends on his previous decision that a blessing should not be recited on these days. Making an interruption is significant when a blessing is recited. When a blessing is not recited, what does it matter whether one makes an interruption or not?</p>
<p>Although this explanation may be acceptable according to the Rambam's view, according to the <i>Shulchan Aruch's</i> ruling mentioned below, a different rationale must be applied. (See <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 422.)</i>ne may make an interruption even within a chapter."
Torah Study 6.1,"It is a mitzvah to respect<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and stand up in deference to him as implied by the verse quoted</i> every Torah sage, even if he is not one's teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in which case more severe measures of honor are necessary, as mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:1) states that this obligation applies only to another sage who surpasses oneself in knowledge.</i>, as [Leviticus 19:32] states: ""Stand up before a white-haired [man] and respect an elder."" [The word] <i>zakein</i>, [translated as ""elder,"" alludes to the Hebrew words meaning] ""one who has acquired wisdom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even if he is young.</p>
<p>The definition of a Torah sage is a matter of question. <i>Kiddushin</i> 49b states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">""On the condition that I am a student"" - we do not say that he must be comparable to Shimon ben Azzai or Shimon ben Zoma. Rather, anyone who can be asked about any matter in the area where he is studying and can reply...<br/>
""On the condition that I am a wise man"" - we do not say that he has to be like the Sages of Yavneh....Rather, anyone who can be asked about any Torah subject and can reply...</p>
<p>The Rambam quotes this statement in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>. Nevertheless, since he does not specify such a definition here, in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, one may therefore assume that in this context, he does not limit himself to that definition. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:2) addresses himself to this issue and explains that here we are referring to a Torah sage who possesses a prodigious amount of knowledge and is considered unique within his community.</i>.""<br>When is one obligated to stand before him? When he approaches within four cubits of him until he passes him."
Torah Study 6.2,"One should not stand before [a sage] in a bathhouse<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., in the inner rooms where people stand undressed.

Rather, this implies that it is forbidden for one to turn away when he sees the sage approaching from afar, so that when the latter approaches, he will not be obligated to stand.</i> It is written [<i>ibid.</i>], ""and you shall fear your God."" With regard to all matters dependent on one's conscience, the Torah states: ""and you shall fear your God."""
Torah Study 6.3,"It is not proper for a sage to trouble the people and position himself before them so that they will have to stand for him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> 33b derives this concept through the exegesis of the verse from Leviticus quoted above.</i>. Rather, he should take shortcuts and have the intent that they should not see him, so that he will not trouble them to stand. The Sages would take circular routes through the outskirts [of their cities], where people who recognize them would not be found, in order not to trouble them."
Torah Study 6.4,"Riding is considered to be walking<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., we do not say that since the sage is seated on his beast, it is not considered as if he is walking. However, in other contexts - see <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:2-3 - the Rambam considers riding as comparable to sitting.</i>. Just as one stands before [a sage who is] walking, so one should stand before one who is riding."
Torah Study 6.5,"When three people are journeying [together], the master should walk in the center, the [student of] greater [stature]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> should follow slightly behind him...</i> on his right, and the one of lesser [stature]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> should follow the sage...</i> on his left."

(With slight textual differences, it also appears in <i>Kiddushin</i> 33b.) Nevertheless, the question arises: Why does the Rambam mention this particular clause?

<p>In this vein, <i>Yevamot</i> 105b states: Those who are required by the holy nation may step over the heads of the holy nation.

a) If both cases come to the court at the same time, the court should try the case of the sage first;<br/>
b) The positive commandment to honor a sage overrides this positive commandment. Hence, the sage's case is tried first, even if it came before the court later.</p>
<p>The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 15:1) accept the latter position. (See also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 21:6.)</i>. [Also,] he is allowed to sit."

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.1,"The Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> includes the verse originally mentioned which</i> (Exodus 13:7  states: ""No chametz shall be seen for you."" Perhaps, if it were buried o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as that verse states</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> it is still ""found in your homes."" The place in which a watchman keeps an entrusted article is also considered ""your homes.""</p>
<p>The prohibition against entrusting chametz to a gentile is not explicitly stated in the Talmud. It can be derived from the leniency allowing one to maintain possession of chametz belonging to a gentile mentioned at the conclusion of the Halachah. Some authorities explain that the Rambam derived the concept from the <i>Mechiltah</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.</p>
<p>In his commentary on the Torah (Exodus 12:19 , the Ramban differs with the concept in its entirety and states that a person does not transgress the prohibition against possessing chametz when it is entrusted to a gentile. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:4) accepts the Rambam's opinion. No later halachic authorities question the matter.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because the chametz is not ""seen.""</i>r entrusted to a gentile, he would not transgress the commandment? The Torah (Exodus 13:7 : ""[No leaven shall be seen for you] in all your territory"" - i.e., in all your possessions.<br>Perhaps a person will be obligated to remove from his property chametz that belongs to a gentile or that was consecrated?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for that is not ""for you."" The rules governing this concept are the major subject of this chapter.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for that is also ""seen."" Therefore,</i> The Torah states (ibid.): ""No [leaven] shall be seen for you."" [We may infer]: You may not see your own [leaven]. However, you may see [leaven] belonging to others or which was consecrated."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.2,"[From the above,] you can learn that chametz belonging to a Jew which was left in his possession, even though it is buried, is located in another city, or is entrusted to a gentile, causes him to violate [the commandments]: ""[leaven] shall not be seen"" and ""[leaven] shall not be found.""<br>Chametz that either was consecrated or belongs to a gentile, and is located within a Jew's property, even if it was with him at home—behold, this is permitted, for [the chametz] is not his<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the Jew's,</i>. Even if it belonged to a resident alien under the authority of the Jewish people<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 5b emphasizes that even a gentile who lives in a Jew's home may keep chametz during Pesach.</i>, we need not force him to remove the chametz from his property on Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state: ""We need not force him (i.e., the gentile) to remove his chametz from our property.""</i>.<br>Nevertheless, it is necessary to construct a partition at least ten handbreadths high in front of chametz belonging to a gentile, lest one come to use it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that in Halachah 3:8, the Rambam considers covering the chametz with a utensil as a sufficient measure to prevent the use of the chametz. Two explanations are offered why, in the present instance, a more stringent measure is required:</p>
<p>a) the amount of chametz the gentile entrusted for safekeeping is probably too large to be covered by utensils;</p>
<p>b) covering the chametz with a utensil is only a temporary measure, intended to be effective only until the end of the day of the festival. Once that day is concluded, the chametz must be destroyed. In contrast, in this instance the chametz will remain in the Jew's possession throughout the entire holiday. Hence, more severe measures must be taken.</p>
<p>The Ramban and the <i>Ba'al HaItur</i> do not accept this requirement and maintain that if a Jew does not accept responsibility for the chametz, he is not obligated to construct a partition. All that is necessary is that the chametz be placed out of the way. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:2) and the later halachic authorities all follow the Rambam's opinion.</i>. [With regard to chametz] that has been consecrated, this is unnecessary; everyone shies away from consecrated property, lest they infringe on [the prohibition of] מעילה.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for in each of these instances, chametz was present within a Jew's possession on Pesach.</i>"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.3,"A gentile who entrusted his chametz to a Jew: Should the Jew accept the responsibility of<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> caring for the chametz as a watchman would, and</i> paying for the worth of the chametz if it is lost or stolen—behold, he is obligated to destroy it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> before the sixth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan.</i>. Since he accepted responsibility for it, it is considered as though it were his<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and, hence, must be destroyed. <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 6a maintains that if a Jew designates a specific place within his home for the gentile and tells him to place his chametz there, he is not obligated to destroy it even though he accepted responsibility for it. Rashi does not accept this position. From the Rambam's omission of the matter, we may assume he also follows Rashi's view (<i>Lechem Mishnah</i>).</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:1) quotes the Rambam and hence, requires the acceptance of the more stringent position. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (440:16) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (440:3) mention certain leniencies based on <i>Tosefot's</i> position.</i>.<br>If he did not accept responsibility for it, he may keep it in his domain<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> without transgressing the prohibitions against possessing chametz</i> and may eat from it after Pesach, for it was in the gentile's possession."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.4,"Should a gentile who forces his way upon people<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a literal translation of the word אנס. Some editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> use the expression אלם instead. However, the intention remains the same, regardless of which term is used.</i> entrust his chametz to a Jew: If the Jew knows that if it is lost or stolen, [the gentile] will obligate him to pay for it—forcing and compelling him to pay even though he did not accept responsibility<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In the previous halachah, the Rambam requires a Jew to destroy chametz only if he willingly accepts responsibility for it. Nevertheless, in this instance,</i>—he is obligated to destroy it. It is considered as though it were his, for the gentile holds him responsible for it."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.5,"A Jew who gives his chametz to a gentile<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> before Pesach, transferring it into the latter's domain</i> as security for a loan and tells him: ""If I do not bring the money between today and such and such a date, you acquire the chametz [retroactively] from the present moment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This specific statement is required, because although a Jewish lender is considered to have acquired a certain degree of ownership over an article given him as security, this principle does not apply with regard to a gentile (<i>Pesachim</i> 31b, <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>,"" the chametz is considered as in the gentile's possession<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In a responsa (no. 252), the Rambam writes that it is as if the Jew sold the chametz to the gentile outright.</i> and is permitted to be used after Pesach. This applies if the date specified was before Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> more specifically, before the sixth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad disagrees with this law and maintains that if this stipulation was included, the chametz is considered as belonging to the gentile even if the date mentioned is after Pesach. The Rambam maintains that since the Jew has the right to redeem his chametz during Pesach, it is still considered his (Rabbenu Ephraim). In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 441:1) accepts the Ra'avad's view.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this leniency applies only when the Jew willingly foregoes any right to the chametz and considers to have repaid his loan with it. Should the Jew decide to redeem his chametz after Pesach, he is retroactively considered the owner and is liable for possessing chametz throughout the holiday.</i>.<br>However, if he did not tell him: ""you acquire the chametz [retroactively] from the present moment,"" that chametz is<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> not considered as repayment for the loan. Rather, it is</i> considered as an article entrusted to the gentile, and it is forbidden to benefit from it after Pesach."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.6,"A Jew and a gentile are traveling together in a ship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Today, in many Jewish communities, the sale of chametz to gentiles is an almost indispensable element in the observance of Pesach.

<p>b) assure the Jewish owner of receiving the goods in return, or their monetary equivalent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are a technical matter which has been discussed by the Rabbis in their responsa over the generations. For this reason, it is not advisable for a person to sell his chametz himself. Rather, he should entrust the local Rabbi with the responsibility of carrying out the sale.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah is a quote from the <i>Tosefta, Pesachim</i> 2:6. Nevertheless, it is worthy of question why the Rambam quotes that source verbatim.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.7,"The Jew may tell the gentile<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is a continuation of the above <i>Tosefta</i>, ibid. 2:7.</i>: ""Rather than buy a <i>manah's</i> worth [of chametz], come and buy two hundred [dinars'] worth [of chametz]...

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.8,"[A person] who possesses a mixture of chametz transgresses [the prohibitions]: ""[leaven] shall not be seen"" and ""[leaven] shall not be found"" because of it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained in Halachah 1:6, according to the Rambam a person who eats a mixture of chametz does not transgress the same Torah prohibition as one who eats chametz itself. Hence, he is not liable for the punishment of כרת. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the possession of these mixtures only violates the prohibitions against possessing chametz when they contain a substantial amount of chametz (at least the size of an olive in a quantity to be eaten בכדי אכילת פרס).</p>
<p>Rav Moshe HaCohen maintains that even the possession of a smaller amount violates these prohibitions. Rav Yosef Caro supports this view in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. Although he does not explicitly state so in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442:1) when discussing this law, the later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>) accept this opinion as binding.</i>; for example: pickle-brine, Babylonian <i>kotach</i>, and Median beer, w<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachah 1:6 for a description of these substances.</i>hich are made from flour.<br>[The same applies] to other similar substances which are eaten<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or drunk.</i>. However, a substance which contains a mixture of chametz, but is not fit to be eaten, may be kept on Pesach."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.9,"How is [the latter principle]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> allowing one to keep chametz unfit for consumption</i> applied? A tanner's trough into which one placed flour and animal hides: Even if this was done one hour before [the time chametz must be] destroyed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the end of the fifth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan</i>, one may keep it. If one placed flour [in the trough] without animal hides three days before [the time chametz must be] destroyed, one may keep it, for the [chametz] has surely become spoiled and rotten. W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> from the residual moisture and odor left in the trough.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.10,"Similarly, an eye salve, a compress, a plaster, or <i>Tiriac</i> into which chametz was placed may be kept on Pesach, for the nature of the chametz is spoiled.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as stated in Halachah 10.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nevertheless, a person may benefit from it on Pesach (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 442:24, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>).</i>"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.11,"Bread itself which has become moldy and is no longer fit for consumption by a dog<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in contrast to chametz which is not human food, as mentioned in the previous halachot, and is permitted once it is no longer fit for human consumption.</p>
<p>Rav Chayim Soloveitchik (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:1) differentiates between the two cases as follows. Chametz itself is a forbidden substance. Hence, it must be spoiled to the point that a dog cannot benefit from it. In contrast, the other substances are merely mixtures of chametz. They are only forbidden because they contain the taste of chametz. Hence, once that taste is no longer suitable for human consumption, there is no reason why they should remain forbidden.</p>
<p>He continues relating that, as stated in Halachot 11 and 12, chametz that is obviously designated for purposes other than food can be used even though it has not become spoiled. Thus, one could explain that once the chametz in the above mixtures becomes unfit for human consumption, it is clearly not food. In contrast, bread which is originally made for that intent must spoil more.</i>, or a compress that has become spoiled<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> beyond being fit for consumption by a dog. Rabbenu Manoach emphasizes that it must become spoiled before the prohibition against chametz takes effect. Otherwise, it must be destroyed.</i>, need not be destroyed.<br>Clothes which were washed with starch<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> made from wheat</i> and, similarly, papers which were stuck together with chametz, and other like cases, may be kept on Pesach.

A young priest should not recite the priestly blessings until he grows a full beard<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 8, Halachah 11, the expression ""grows a full beard"" is a primarily measure of age, whether the person actually grows a beard or not.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:34), based on <i>Tosafot, Chulin</i> 24b, states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">A minor who has not manifested signs of physical maturity should not recite the priestly blessing alone. However, he may recite the blessing together with his brethren, the priests, to learn and become educated.<br/>
If he has manifested signs of physical maturity, he may recite the priestly blessing even while alone. However, he should do so only as a temporary measure, and not as a fixed practice, until he grows a full beard.</p>
<p>Intoxication: - The Hebrew יין literally means wine. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 128:55 notes that the Rambam speaks only about wine and does not mention other alcoholic beverages. Accordingly, he explains that a person who becomes drunk from other alcoholic beverages may recite the priestly blessing, unless he is so drunk that he has no control of himself.</p>
<p>It is significant that in Chapter 4, Halachah 17, when speaking about the prohibition against an intoxicated person praying, the Rambam states: ""A person who is drunk should not pray.... When is a person considered drunk? When he cannot speak before a king."" See also <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 1:1-2, where the Rambam describes the prohibition against serving in the Temple while intoxicated and mentions, albeit with differences between them, both a person who drank wine and one who became intoxicated from other alcoholic beverages.</p>

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 15.5,"The ritual impurity of [the priest's] hands: What is implied?

He maintains that this choice of language was intended to imply that if a priest washed his hands in the morning, he need not wash them a second time unless they have become ritually impure. He also quotes a responsum of Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, who explicitly states that a priest may rely on his morning washing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:6), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the opinion of Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Sotah</i> 39a), who require the priests to have their hands washed a second time as an additional measure of holiness.</i>.

<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), the Rambam cites this teaching as a classic example of a fundamental principle regarding the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. Though the Talmud often states that many mitzvot are involved in the performance or transgression of a particular commandment, this does not mean that the mitzvah should be counted as more than one mitzvah when calculating the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

The criteria he mentions are thus not hard and fast rules, and will vary if different conditions prevail in other societies.</p>
<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid., based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 40-41), the Rambam explains that although Rabbi Meir maintained that all gentile images were forbidden because they would be used for different pagan rites, the Sages disagreed and laid down the following general rules.</i> It is forbidden to benefit from any images found in villages, for one may assume that they were made for the sake of idol worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even if we have no proof to that effect, we follow the general rule that it is forbidden to benefit from an image which is merely suspected of being worshiped as an idol.</i>.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 7.7,"Statues of false deities which are found discarded in the marketplace or in a scrap metal heap are permitted.

<p>Thus, according to the Talmud, the interpretation of these laws is as follows: If one finds an idol that was obviously purposefully broken (Shmuel's law), it is permitted to benefit from it. If, however, the idol was not destroyed with an obvious destructive intent, it is forbidden to benefit from it, as Rabbi Yochanan states.</i>"

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.2,"[Then,]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one first recites <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and then, the blessing of <i>hamapil</i> (the blessing discussed in Halachah 1). This opinion is quoted by the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 239:1). However, this order is only followed in Nusach Ari. Both Nusach Ashkenaz and Nusach Sephard follow the order stated by the Rambam.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1) relates that Rav Zeira was accustomed to recite the <i>Shema</i> over and over until he fell asleep. This indicates that the <i>Shema</i> is the last thing said at night before sleeping (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> in the name of Rabbenu Nissim Gaon).</i> one reads the first section of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and goes to sleep. [T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 4b explains that ""it is a mitzvah"" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring. These statements are based on Psalms 4:5: ""Tremble, but do not sin. Speak in your heart upon your bed and be still."" Our Sages interpreted ""Speak in your heart"" and ""upon your bed"" as allusions to the phrases ""with all your heart"" and ""upon your bed"" in the<i>Shema</i>.</p>
<p>That Talmudic passage implies that the reason for reciting the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is to protect oneself from undesirable influences during the night. According to Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) and others who allow the evening service to be recited before sunset, the recitation of <i>Shema</i> before retiring enables us to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. According to the writings of the Ari, the reciting of the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is a service of spiritual preparation for the soul's ascent from the body during sleep.</p>
<p>Since <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that ""it is a mitzvah"" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring, it was customary in certain communities to recite a blessing before reciting the <i>Shema</i> as is customary before performing other mitzvot. In his responsa (<i>Pe'air HaDor</i> 100), the Rambam specifically rules against reciting such a blessing. [However, note the <i>Kolbo</i> (29) who quotes the Rambam as stating in a responsa that such a blessing is required.]</i>his applies] even if his wife is sleeping with him.<br>If he is overcome by sleep<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and cannot recite the entire first section, at the very least</i>, he should read the first verse [of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>] or verses of mercy and afterwards, he may go to sleep."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.3,"When a person awakes after concluding his sleep<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., in the morning when he has completed his night's sleep.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> points out that although <i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one recites this blessing upon arising, the Rambam specifies that it be said only after concluding one's sleep. This makes it clear that a person who wakes up in the middle of the night and intends to return to sleep, need not recite this blessing.</i>, while still in bed, he says:
<p class=""rambam_indented"">My Lord, t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:1, the Rambam writes:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">All of the blessings begin with <i>Baruch</i> and conclude with <i>Baruch</i> except the final blessing of the blessings associated with the <i>Shema</i>, a blessing which follows directly after another blessing, and a blessing over fruit, those [blessings] which resemble it, or a blessing for mitzvot.</p>
<p>Given this statement, the commentaries wonder why this blessing does not begin with <i>Baruch</i>. Furthermore, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:5, the Rambam writes that, unless a blessing follows another blessing, it must mention God's sovereignty over the world and no such mention is made in this blessing.</p>
<p>The <i>Meiri</i> in his commentary to <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) offers the following resolution to these difficulties: Despite the fact that the entire period of a person's sleep divides between the recitation of <i>hamapil</i> and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i>, the sleep is not considered as an interruption and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is considered as following directly after <i>hamapil</i>. Accordingly, it is not required to begin with <i>Baruch</i> or mention God's sovereignty.</p>
<p>Other commentaries who follow different halachic perspectives than the Rambam offer these resolutions:<br/>
1) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is a blessing of praise and prayer and does not require an opening phrase of blessing, in the same way that the blessing recited before travelling does not (<i>Tosafot, Pesachim</i> 104b).<br/>
2) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is generally recited immediately after the blessing of אשר יצר and therefore can be considered as a blessing which follows another blessing.</i>he soul that You have placed within me is pure<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Despite his lowly physical state, man possesses an innate spirituality, a pure Godly soul, which is the source of all his positive actions and thoughts.</i>.

As long as the soul is lodged within me, I am thankful before You, O God, my Lord, Master of all works<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some siddurim add the phrase, ""Lord of all souls,"" at this point so that the concluding phrase of the body of the blessing will correspond to the wording of the blessing itself.</i>. Blessed are You, God, who restores souls to dead bodies."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4,"When one hears the crow of a rooster, he recites:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are slight, but significant, differences between the text of the blessing here and its source in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who gives the rooster understanding to distinguish between day and night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the crowing of the rooster generally heralds the dawn, the Sages established this blessing in response to it.</p>
<p>The word שכוי is translated as ""rooster"" based on <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26a which refers to Job 38:36: ""Who has put wisdom in the inward parts and [given] understanding to the rooster (שכוי).""</p>
<p>Rabbenu Asher (in his halachic commentary to <i>Berachot</i>) interprets שכוי as ""heart."" The heart is the source of understanding which allows man to distinguish between day and night.</i>.<br>When he puts on his clothes, he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who clothes the naked<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Understood simply, this blessing expresses our appreciation to God for the clothes we wear.

Covering our heads symbolizes Israel's fear and awe before God's presence. This is their glory, as Isaiah 62:3 states: ""You shall be a crown of glory in the hand of God.""</i>.<br>When he passes his hands over his eyes, he recites: [Blessed...] who opens the eyes of the blind<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing is based on Psalms 146:18 and can be interpreted as a statement of gratitude for more than our physical eyesight. We thank God for the ability to see His greatness in creation. These are our metaphorical ""eyes of reason.""</i>.<br>When he sits up in his bed, he recites: [Blessed...] who unties those bound.<br>When he lowers his feet from the bed and rests them on the ground, he recites: [Blessed...] who spreads the earth over the waters<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing is based on Psalms 136:6: ""[Give thanks] to the One who spread the earth over the waters, for His lovingkindness is eternal.""</i>.<br>When he stands up, he recites: [Blessed...] who straightens the bowed.<br>When he washes his hands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:2, the Rambam specifically states that one should recite this blessing before washing one's hands so that the blessing will precede the performance of the mitzvah (<i>Pesachim</i> 7a). Rabbenu Yonah states that one should not recite this blessing until after washing one's hands because until one has washed his hands, he is not in a fit state to mention God's name (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 4:2). (According to others, the recitation of this blessing should be delayed until after drying one's hands.)</p>
<p>The Rambam obviously does not accept this rationale since he requires many blessings to be recited before the washing of the hands as above.</i>, he recites: [Blessed...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the washing of hands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This washing is required in preparation for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> and the morning service.</p>
<p>Based on the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. I, 169b, 184b), the Rabbis rule that, on washing in the morning, one pours water over his hands three times alternately, i.e., once over the right hand, once over the left hand, once more over the right, etc. This is done in order to remove the spirit of impurity that remains after sleep.</i>.<br>When he washes his face, he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who removes the bonds of sleep from my eyes and slumber from my eyelids. May it be Your will, God<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This entire prayer is considered one blessing. Therefore, one should not recite ""Amen"" after hearing a colleague recite the opening sentence of the blessing (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 46:1). <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) states that one should say ""and may it be..."" to emphasize that the prayer is a single blessing.</i>, my Lord and Lord of my fathers, that You accustom me to the performance of [Your] commandments and do not accustom me to sins or transgressions.

Strengthen me in Your commandments and grant my portion in Your Torah. Allow me to find favor, lovingkindness, and mercy in Your eyes and the eyes of all who see me and bestow upon me benevolent kindnesses. Blessed are You, God, who bestows benevolent kindnesses."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.5,"Whenever one enters the toilet<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah is dealt with among the morning blessings, since a person generally relieves himself shortly after arising. Nevertheless, its instructions apply whenever one relieves himself.</p>
<p>[Note, however, the opinion quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 6:1, which maintains that the blessing, אשר יצר, can be considered as one of the morning blessings and should be recited even if one does not relieve oneself.]</i>, before entering, he says:
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Be honored, holy honorable ones, servants of the Most High. Help me. Help me. Guard me. Guard me<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., continue to do that which you have been commanded even though I am about to take leave of you momentarily.</i>. Wait for me until I enter and come out, as this is the way of humans<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Avudraham</i> states that this prayer should only be recited by extremely righteous men. Anyone else who recites it would appear conceited. For this reason, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 3) rules that this prayer is not recited today.</i>.<br>After he comes out, he recites:
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who formed man in wisdom a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the <i>Targum Yonaton</i> to Ezekiel 28:12 which uses similar terms to praise the Divine wisdom manifest in the creation of the human body.</i>nd created within him many openings and cavities. It is revealed and known before the throne of Your glory that if one of them were to be blocked or if one of them were to be opened, it would be impossible to exist for even one moment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) quotes <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> (1:3) which states that unlike a manmade container which is unable to hold liquid when pierced by even the smallest pin, the body that God created is full of holes and cavities which open and close in a manner that allows man to continue to exist.</p>
<p>The <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> (<i>Shemini</i>) relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented""><b>Happy are you, Israel! A mitzvah was granted correspondent to each and every one of your limbs.... The numerical value of חלולים חלולים is 248, the number of limbs in the human body and the number of positive commandments in the Torah.</b></i>. Blessed are You, God, who heals all flesh and works wonders."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.6,"When one fastens his belt<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam accepts the interpretation most commentaries have given to the words מייניה אסר in <i>Berachot</i> 60b, the source for this blessing. The Ra'avad interprets the Talmud as referring to putting on one's trousers.</i>, he recites: [Blessed...universe,] who girds Israel with strength<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Avodat Yitzchok</i> explains that a belt or girdle protects a person's body and affords him greater strength. Rav Asher of Lunil explains that this blessing refers to the spiritual strength granted to Israel through Torah study.</i>.<br>When he puts on his shoes, he recites: [Blessed...universe,] for You have provided me with all my needs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Several different explanations are given for the association of this blessing with the putting on of one's shoes. The <i>Avudraham</i> states simply that a person is unable to move about freely without shoes. Therefore, putting on shoes enables him to acquire whatever he needs.</p>
<p>Rav Shlomo Kluger cites our Sages' statement, ""A person should sell everything he owns and buy shoes,"" as evidence that a person who has shoes to wear has acquired that which is most necessary.</p>
<p>The <i>Sh'loh</i> quotes the Maharshal as explaining the source for this blessing as Psalms 8:6-9.</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">You have made him [man] a little lower than angels.... You have given him dominion over the works of Your hands. You have put everything under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the sky and the fish of the seas.</p>
<p>Wearing leather shoes demonstrates the way in which the animal kingdom has been placed ""under man's feet"" and makes us aware that the dominion we have been granted over all creation allows us to acquire ""all our needs.""</i>.<br>When he walks to depart on his way, he recites: [Blessed... universe,] who prepares the steps of man.<br>[A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing is based on Psalms 37:23: ""The steps of man are ordered by God"" and Proverbs 20:24: ""The steps of man are from God,"" both of which imply that in addition to giving man the ability to walk, God also guides the direction of his steps.</i>lso,] every day, a person should recite:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a non-Jew<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We thank God for creating us with the opportunity to relate to Him through the Torah and mitzvot which were given only to the Jews.</p>
<p><i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) uses a positive statement for the formula of this blessing: ""Blessed... who has made me a Jew."" Rabbenu Asher quotes this text. The Rambam's version is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 9:2. Rabbenu Yitzchok Alfasi also follows the Jerusalem Talmud.</p>
<p>The <i>Levush, Orach Chayim</i> 46, explains the reason for reciting the blessing in the negative: <i>Eruvin</i> 13a states that it would have been better for man not to have been created than to have been created (i.e., man's soul was in a higher state before its descent into the world than it is while in this world). Therefore, we do not express thanks for being created. Nevertheless, having been created, we thank God for not creating us as gentiles since gentiles have a far lesser number of commandments to fulfill.</p>
<p>The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> explains that the negative formula was chosen for the following reason. Our Sages required that we recite three blessings each morning. Torah law states that whenever a single blessing covers two different circumstances, the second blessing may not be recited. Therefore, since a statement thanking God ""for making me a Jew"" would make the blessing for ""not making me a servant"" superfluous, it is preferable to recite this blessing using the negative formula.</i>.<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a woman.<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a servant."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.7,"These eighteen blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Only seventeen blessings are recited in the morning. The eighteenth blessing is <i>hamapil</i>, the blessing recited before retiring at night. Nevertheless, as explained in the commentary to Halachah 3, the Rambam views it as connected to the morning blessings.</p>
<p>The eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and also to the number of times God's name is mentioned in Psalms 29, in the song sung by the Jewish People after the splitting of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19), and in the three sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. (See also our commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4.)</i> do not have a particular order. Rather, one recites each of them in response to the condition for which the blessing was instituted, at the appropriate time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements in this and the following two halachot are all based on the idea that these blessings are ברכות הודאה - ""blessings of thanks."" Therefore, a person who does not receive the benefit associated with a particular blessing does not recite the blessing thanking God for that particular condition.</p>
<p>Rav Natrunai Gaon and Rav Amram Gaon differ with the Rambam. They consider these blessings to be ברכות שבח - ""blessings of praise"" for the goodness which God has granted the world as a whole and not thanks for benefit which one has derived as an individual. This opinion is accepted by the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) and other Ashkenazic halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Sephardic authorities accept the Rambam's view with certain reservations.</i>.<br>What is implied? One who fastens his belt while still in his bed recites [the blessing] ""who girds Israel with strength<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although in Halachah 6, the Rambam stated that this blessing should be recited after one has gotten off his bed, if one fastens his belt while still in bed, he recites the appropriate blessing at that time.</i>."" One who hears the voice of the rooster recites [the blessing] ""who gives understanding to the rooster.""<br>Any blessing in which one is not obligated<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because one has not personally derived the benefit associated with the mitzvah</i> should not be recited."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.8,"What is implied?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah exemplifies the final principle mentioned in the previous halachah, that a person should not recite a blessing if he does not derive the benefit associated with it.</i> One who sleeps in his outer garment should not recite the blessing ""who clothes the naked"" upon rising<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since, though he is clothed, he performed the activity associated with the blessing on the previous day.</i>.<br>One who walks barefoot does not recite the blessing, ""for You have provided me with all my needs.""<br>On Yom Kippur and the ninth of Av, when one does not wash, one does not recite the blessing <i>al netilat yadayim</i>, n<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor 3:2, the Rambam qualifies the prohibition against washing by stating: ""One [who is] soiled from excrement or dirt may wash the dirty area in the normal fashion without worry."" He also allows a woman to wash her hands in order to feed her child.</p>
<p>The source for the Rambam's statements, <i>Yoma</i> 77b, explains that the reason for this leniency is the presence of <i>shivta</i> on her hands. Rashi interprets this as רוח רעה, the spirit of impurity which rests on our hands before the morning washing.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Yoma</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) rules that one does wash his hands upon rising in the morning on Yom Kippur since רוח רעה is considered like any filth and may be removed in its normal fashion. As apparent from the previous halachot, the Rambam does not consider רוח רעה as a significant factor and forbids such washing. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh, Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i>.)</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 613:2) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion and states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">One washes his hands in the morning [on Yom Kippur] and recites על נטילת ידים. One should be careful to wash only the ends of the joints of his fingers.</p>
<p>The Ramah adds: ""And he should not intend to enjoy the washing, and do so [only] to remove the רוח רעה from his hands.""</i>or the blessing ""who removes the bonds of sleep....""<br>One who does not relieve himself does not recite the blessing, ""who created man in wisdom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as part of the morning blessings.</i>...."" The same applies regarding the remainder of the blessings."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10,"One who rises to study Torah, whether the Written or Oral Law<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is debate in the Talmud about this matter. Some Sages did not require the recitation of a blessing for the study of certain portions of the Oral Law (See <i>Berachot</i> 11b). Nevertheless, the decision quoted by the Rambam is accepted by all halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:2 explains the reason for this decision, ""They [all portions of the Oral Law] are all Torah and were given to Moses at Mount Sinai.""</i>, before he recites the <i>Shema</i>, should wash his hands beforehand, recite [the following] three blessings, and then study<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Both here and in Halachah 11, the Rambam states that one must study immediately after reciting these blessings. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) explains the motivating principle: All blessings recited before the performance of a commandment must be followed immediately by the fulfillment of the commandment.</p>
<p>This position is, however, not universally accepted. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b), Rabbenu Yonah, and the Mordechai disagree and do not require the repetition of the blessings even if an interruption was made between their recitation and Torah study. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>,:9) warns against making such an interruption.</p>
<p>[The comparison of the blessings before Torah study to the blessings of the mitzvot is not universally accepted. In addition to the opinion of the Ramban mentioned in the following halachah, the <i>Levush</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) compares the blessings before Torah study to the blessings recited before partaking of food. Just as one thanks God for the satisfaction granted from food and other physical things, one blesses Him for the satisfaction derived from Torah study. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:1, <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> Vol. 14.]</i>.<br>[These blessings] are:
<p class=""rambam_indented"">[Blessed... universe,] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the words of Torah.<br/>
And<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The presence here of the Hebrew letter <i>vav</i> (ו) which is generally translated as ""and"" is the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) explains that, according to <i>Rabbenu Tam</i>, any blessing that follows another blessing of only a single line must itself begin ""Blessed are You..."" and cannot be included in the phrase ""Blessed are You..."" in the first blessing. Therefore, since this paragraph does not begin ""Blessed are You...,"" it appears to be a continuation of the first blessing and not a blessing of its own. The <i>vav</i> - ""and"" - indicates the connection between the two paragraphs.</p>
<p>The Rambam, however, clearly states that the second paragraph is considered as a blessing in its own right and not a continuation of the first blessing. The <i>vav</i> would, therefore, appear to be superfluous. Though most printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include a <i>vav</i>, the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Yemenite manuscripts, and the Ramah's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> all lack a <i>vav</i>. (Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:5, which explains that even according to the opinion that the second paragraph is a separate blessing, adding the <i>vav</i> is in place.)</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 47:6 rules that the <i>vav</i> should be recited. The Ramah adds that although the custom is not to say it, it should be said. Most siddurim of <i>Nusach Ashkenaz</i> and <i>Sefard</i> include the <i>vav</i>.</i> please, God, our Lord, make pleasant the words of Your Torah in our mouths and in the mouths of Your people, the entire House of Israel.

<p>Nevertheless, <i>Berachot</i> 21a and <i>Yoma</i> 37a state that the obligation to recite a blessing on Torah study stems from the Torah itself.

(Note the statement of Rabbi Simlai, <i>Berachot</i> 32a, which suggests praising God before reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.) Though from the passage from <i>Shabbat</i> quoted below one might infer that the recitation of these verses was instituted later, perhaps this refers to the designation of the specific verses to be recited, while the practice of reciting verses itself had already existed.</i> those who recite songs from the Book of Psalms every day; from ""A song of praise by David...

That cannot be. Behold, the master taught that one who recites <i>Hallel</i> every day is considered as a blasphemer and abuser.<br/>
In regard to what did [Rabbi Yossi] make his statement? In regard to פסוקי דזמרא - the verses of song.</p>
<p>The Rambam understands פסוקי דזמרא as referring to the last six chapters of Psalms (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). This definition is also accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher.</i>. It has become customary to read verses before and after them.<br>They instituted a blessing before the [recitation of the] songs, <i>Baruch She'amar</i>..., and a blessing after [concluding] them, <i>Yishtabach</i>.

Therefore, <i>Yishtabach</i> is considered a blessing which follows directly after another blessing - despite the verses recited between the two blessings. Accordingly, it does not begin ""Blessed are You, God....""</p>
<p>Though the verses of פסוקי דזמרא are not considered an interruption between the blessings, idle conversation certainly would be. Thus, the Jerusalem Talmud rules that anyone who talks between <i>Baruch She'amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> has transgressed and is not fit to be part of the Jewish army (which must be composed only of righteous men).</i>fterwards, one recites the blessings for <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and recites the <i>Shema</i>."

<p>In this halachah, the Rambam equates all three recitations of the <i>Kedushah</i> in the morning service. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 59) cites Rav Natrunai Gaon as also sharing this opinion. There is no specific Talmudic or Midrashic source to this effect.

<p>Rabbenu Yonah quotes the opinion of the Ashkenazic authorities who distinguish between these recitations of <i>Kedushah</i>. They maintain that since, in the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, we liken ourselves to the angels and recite the same praises, a <i>minyan</i> is necessary. However, the other <i>Kedushot</i> are simply narrative descriptions of the praises uttered by the angels and therefore, do not require a <i>minyan</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 59:3) quotes the Rambam's position. The Ramah concludes that even an individual should recite the blessing without deleting the <i>Kedushah</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> writes that Rabbi Avraham, the Rambam's son, states that his father later changed his position regarding this halachah and wrote in a responsum that one should recite <i>Kedushah</i> even without a quorum of ten.

Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that chametz is a severe prohibition, and greater care would be taken.</i>. [Nevertheless,] all Jews in Babylonia, <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, Spain, and the cities of the western [diaspora] have accepted the custom of not stirring wheat in water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach mentions that this custom was several hundred years old in his time (approx. 1200 CE). <i>Pesachim</i> 40a mentions that even in Talmudic times, a בעל נפש (a person precise in the observance of the commandments) would not use wheat that had been stirred.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.9,"[Exodus 12:17] states: ""Keep watch over the matzot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some ancient manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include these two lines in the previous halachah, but all published texts follow this division.</i>"" - i.e., be careful of the matzot and protect them from any possibility of becoming chametz. Therefore, our Sages declared: A person must be careful regarding the grain which he eats on Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 40a relates that Ravvah would tell the harvesters cutting wheat for Pesach: ""Have the intent that this grain be used for the mitzvah of matzah.""</i> and [make sure] that no water has come in contact with it after it has been harvested<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Based on the above passage from <i>Pesachim</i>, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi and the Rambam require that the grain be watched from the time of harvesting onward. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Asher follows a more lenient policy and does not require the wheat to be watched until it is ground. [Rabbenu Nissim explains that even Rav Yitzchak Alfasi only recommended watching the matzah from harvesting as a pious measure, and not as an absolute rule.]</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 453:4) explains that it is preferable to use grain that has been watched from harvesting; as a minimum requirement, one must use grain that has been watched from the time it has been ground into flour. If there is no other alternative, one may buy flour in the marketplace and begin watching from the time the dough is kneaded.</p>
<p>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> clarifies the latter point explaining that where grain is washed or submerged in water before grinding it into flour, such grain may not be used for matzah. (This practice is still common in many communities.) In practice, most <i>shemurah matzah</i> made at present is watched from the time the grain was harvested.</i>, so that it will not have become chametz at all.<br>Grain which sunk in a river or<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 40b mentions a ship which sank carrying a cargo of wheat.

Since the wheat was constantly being agitated, it would not become leavened. In contrast, this halachah contains a more stringent ruling, for the grain was left at rest (<i>Tzafnat Paneach</i>).</i>. Rather, he should sell it to a Jew<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and not a gentile</i> [before it becomes prohibited] and inform him [about its nature], so that he can eat it before Pesach.

<p>The <i>Rokeach</i> mentioned that in his age, baking conditions had changed from Talmudic times. More people were involved in the process and the ovens were larger and baked matzot more quickly. Therefore, leniency was taken as regards the restriction of the size of the dough.

That halachah specifically states that a sick person may be given chametz to eat as a remedy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that halachah explains that if the sick person does not benefit from the forbidden substance in the normal manner, it may be used as a remedy even if there is no danger to life or limb. The Rambam gives the example of including chametz in a compress.</p>
<p>On that basis, Rabbenu Manoach questions why wheat cannot be used as a poultice as stated in our halachah. However, he resolves the issue by explaining that, in our case, the wheat would become chametz before it was applied to the wound.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 466:5 (and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>) emphasize that it is permitted to use grain as a remedy for a wound only if there is a question of danger to life or limb. Furthermore, this leniency is qualified as follows:</p>
<p>a) it must be an established medical fact that the remedy works;</p>
<p>b) effort must be made to reduce the chance of the grain becoming leavened to the greatest extent possible (e.g., preparing grain by boiling it in fruit juice which does not become leavened).</i>.<br>We should not place flour into charoset.

In Halachah 2, when the Rambam described the use of מי פירות, he explained that they will not cause grain products to become leavened when used alone. However, if they are mixed with water, they can cause the grain products to become leavened. Indeed, the commentaries relate that the mixture of these liquids with water speeds up the leavening process.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Ra'avad and other authorities question the leniency granted by the Rambam. In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:2) advises against, but does not forbid, mixing these liquids with water. The Ramah (and accordingly, Ashkenazic custom) prohibits such a mixture entirely.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> substitutes the word יין (wine) for מים (water). According to such a rendition, there is no difficulty.</i>.<br>On the first day, it is forbidden to knead or baste<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even though basting the dough with other substances will not change its taste appreciably, the Rambam forbids this.

However, it is omitted in some of the Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. In practice, there is also debate about this issue. In his responsum, the Rashbah explains Rav Yitzchak Alfasi's view, stating that a person should leave the utensil submerged until he feels that all the absorbed chametz has been released. However, the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 121) and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> do not require waiting any substantial amount of time. Their view is accepted by the later authorities.

A similar decision is rendered by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 121:7). Nevertheless, the authorities suggest that chametz may be purged from knives by boiling. However, they do not permit this leniency in the following instances:</p>
<p>a) when the knives are rusty;</p>
<p>b) when they have serrated edges;</p>
<p>c) when the handle is separate from the blade and enclosed around it, allowing for the possibility for residue to collect between them.</p>
<p>In the latter instance, even ליבון (exposing the knife to open fire) is insufficient. Since most knives today are made in this manner, they should not be kashered for Pesach or for ordinary use after having been used with prohibited foods. Both the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> state that purchasing new knives for Pesach is the most desirable manner of fulfilling the mitzvah.</i><br>Similarly, [with regard to] knives, the blade and the handle should be boiled in a כלי ראשון.

<p><i>Pesachim</i> 30b explains that this concept is derived from the Torah itself. Leviticus 6:21 states that any pot in which meat from a sin offering has been cooked must be broken. A sin offering can only be eaten for one day. Once that time has passed, the taste of the meat absorbed in the pot is considered as נותר (sacrificial meat which has been kept past its required time), and thus forbidden.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.26,"[A person possesses a utensil which is] a כלי ראשון<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and desires to boil it [in order to prepare it for Passover use] — and hence must be kashered by boiling water inside of it, as explained in Halachah 23.</i> and desires to boil it [in order to prepare it for Passover use], however, he cannot find a larger utensil into which [to place it] to boil it: Behold, he may place a border of clay around its [top] edge from the outside and fill it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the utensil</i> with water until the water overflows its edge.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.1","How many shofar blasts is a person required to hear on Rosh Hashanah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> according to Torah law?</i>? Nine.<br>[This figure is derived<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b.</i> as follows]: The Torah mentions the word תרועה [sounding the shofar] three times in association with Rosh Hashanah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> twice: Leviticus 23:24 and Numbers 29:1.</i> and the <i>Yovel</i>. Every<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> תרועה <b>must be preceded and followed by a [single] long blast. -</b> Leviticus 25:9 states: והעברת שופר, and Numbers 29:1 states: תעבירו שופר. In both cases, the verb means ""cause to pass."" From that expression, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid., derives that a long note should be sounded before the תרועה.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the text <i>Galia Masechta</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 3) explains that the essential element of the mitzvah is the <i>teru'ah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a blast which is interrupted into shorter sounds, as described in Halachot 2-4.</i></i>, since that is the sound specifically required by the Torah. The <i>teki'ot</i> are required only as a supplementary factor.</i> תרועה must be preceded and followed by a [single] long blast.

<p>The Rambam's statements are accepted by Rabbenu Asher, Rabbenu Nissim, and most other authorities. Nevertheless, it is significant that Rav Hai Gaon, one of the major authorities who preceded the Rambam, offers a different explanation for Rabbi Abahu's actions.</p>
<p>Rav Hai Gaon maintains that it is impossible that a doubt existed among the Jewish people concerning such an important manner as sounding the shofar. Since the shofar was sounded each year, surely the tradition could have been maintained. Hence, he explains that all the different manners of sounding the shofar were acceptable and that Rabbi Abahu's contribution was the establishment of a uniform custom that included all the different practices common among the Jewish people. By mentioning the ""many years"" and ""exiles,"" the Rambam addresses himself to the question raised by Rav Hai Gaon.</i>oes it resemble the wailing with which the women cry when they moan<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The word <i>teru'ah</i> is translated into Aramaic as <i>yevavah</i> (moan), as in Judges 5:28: ""Sisra's mother gazed out the window and moaned through the lattice.""</i>, or the sighs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., longer sounds</i> which a person who is distressed about a major matter will release repeatedly? Perhaps a combination of the two - sighing and the crying which will follow it - is called <i>teru'ah</i>, because a distressed person will sigh and then cry? Therefore, we fulfill all [these possibilities]."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.3","The crying<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> mentioned in the previous halachah</i> refers to what we call <i>teru'ah</i>. The repeated sighs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> mentioned in the previous halachah</i> refer to what we call three <i>shevarim<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">. - Like sighs, these sounds are neither short like <i>teru'ot</i>, nor prolonged like <i>teki'ot</i>, but rather of intermediate length, as described in the following halachah.</i></i>.<br>Thus, the order of blowing the shofar is as follows: First, one recites the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in Halachah 10.</i> and sounds a <i>teki'ah</i>; afterwards, three <i>shevarim</i>; and afterwards, a <i>teru'ah</i>; and afterwards, a <i>teki'ah</i>.

<p>Although the pattern of shofar blowing described by the Rambam has become universally accepted among the Jewish people, it is unclear when this practice was first instituted. One of the fundamental texts of the period directly following the conclusion of the Talmud, the <i>Sh'eltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon (note 171), mentions a different practice.</p>
<p>Three series of blasts from each pattern are not blown directly after each other. Rather, after sounding three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>, three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>, and then three series of <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> is sounded.</i>.<br>[Then,] he sounds a <i>teki'ah</i>; afterwards, three <i>shevarim</i>; and afterwards, a <i>teki'ah</i>.

He repeats this pattern [until he completes] three series.<br>Thus, there are a total of thirty shofar blasts, in order to remove any doubt."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.4","The required length of a <i>teru'ah</i> is that of two <i>teki'ot</i>. T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These statements are the source of much controversy among the Rabbis. The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b) states: ""The required length of the <i>teki'ah</i> is three <i>teru'ot</i>; a <i>teru'ah</i> is three sobs.""</p>
<p>The Talmud questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the <i>baraita</i> has taught: ""the required length of a <i>teki'ah</i> is that of a <i>teru'ah</i>!""</p>
<p>Abbaye replied: ""The author of the Mishnah considered the length of all the <i>teki'ot</i> in comparison to the length of all the <i>teru'ot</i>. The author of the <i>baraita</i> considered the length of each blast. There is no difference of opinion between them.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam interprets the above to mean: ""The required length of all six <i>teki'ot</i> is equivalent to the required length of all three <i>teru'ot</i>,"" thus establishing each <i>teru'ah</i> as twice the length of a <i>teki'ah</i>. Hence, according to the Rambam, the length of the <i>teki'ot</i> are dependent on the length of the <i>teru'ot</i>.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Nissim objects to the Rambam's interpretation, explaining that the word והעברת, the verb mentioned in the commandment to blow the shofar, implies a long blast, and hence the measure mentioned by the Rambam would not be appropriate.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Ra'avad does not accept the Rambam's interpretation, and explains that the Mishnah establishes an independent measure for the length of a <i>teki'ah</i> - three <i>teru'ot</i> - with each <i>teru'ah</i> being equal to three short sobs. Thus, the measure of a <i>teki'ah</i> is equivalent to nine short sounds. The Ramban and the Rashba also subscribe to this view.</p>
<p>Rashi and most Ashkenazic authorities accept the simple meaning of the Mishnah and explain that a <i>teki'ah</i> is equal to the length of a <i>teru'ah</i>. However, as explained in the previous halachot, there are three different interpretations of the definition of a <i>teru'ah</i>. Thus, the required length for the <i>teki'ah</i> varies accordingly.</p>
<p>Regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:3) mentions the views of Rashi and the Ra'avad, but not that of the Rambam.</i>he required length of the three <i>shevarim</i> is that of a <i>teru'ah</i>.<br>When a person sounds a <i>teki'ah</i> and a <i>teru'ah</i>, and afterwards sounds a long <i>teki'ah</i>, extending it twice the length of the original one, w<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> with the intention that it be considered to be the final blast of the first series and the initial blast of the following series</i>e do not say that it may be considered to be two <i>teki'ot</i> - thus allowing one [to complete the series merely by] sounding a <i>teru'ah</i> and another <i>teki'ah</i>. R<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This represents a rephrasing of the Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:9 and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a.</i>ather, even if one extended a <i>teki'ah</i> the entire day, it is considered to be only a single <i>teki'ah</i> and one must sound another <i>teki'ah, teru'ah,</i> and <i>teki'ah</i> [until he completes] three series."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.5","If a person hears one shofar blast at one hour and a second one an hour later - even if he waits the entire day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34a-b quotes Rabbi Yochanan: ""If a person heard the nine shofar blasts even over a span of nine hours, he fulfills his obligation.""</i> - the two may be considered to be a single unit and he may fulfill his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 588:2) quotes this law. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (588:2) compares this situation to the laws of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 65:1) and explains that if one is prevented from hearing the shofar by forces beyond one's control, it is considered to be an interruption and one must begin the last series of blasts anew.</i>.<br>The above applies provided each series is heard in the proper order; i.e., one may not hear a <i>teru'ah</i> and afterwards two <i>teki'ot</i>, or two <i>teki'ot</i>, and afterwards a <i>teru'ah</i>, and the like."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.6","If a person heard nine shofar blasts from nine men simultaneously<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At the same time, six blew <i>teki'ot</i> and three, <i>teru'ot</i>, so that the person could have heard the required number of shofar blasts</i>, he has not fulfilled his obligation for a single blast.

A person does not fulfill his obligation until he hears all nine shofar blasts, for they are all [only] one mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in Halachah 1.</i>. Thus, they are dependent one on the other."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.7","The congregation is obligated to hear the shofar blasts together with the order of blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16b explains that the Sages instituted the blowing of the shofar in the midst of the prayer service in order to confuse Satan, lest he lodge accusations against the Jews in the midst of their prayers. The Sages explain (ibid., 32b) that it would have been appropriate to institute the shofar blowing in the morning service. However, the Romans desired to stamp out the performance of the mitzvot and sent guards to make sure that the mitzvah was not fulfilled. After midday, the guards left, and then, in the musaf service, the shofar would be sounded.</p>
<p>Originally, the Sages' decree involved determining the place of the service when the mitzvah required by the Torah would be fulfilled and this halachah must be interpreted in that context. However, as explained in Halachot 11 and 12, it became universally accepted Jewish custom to blow the shofar before the musaf prayers to fulfill the Torah's commandment, and thus ""confuse the Satan"" even before the beginning of our prayers, and then to sound the shofar again in the midst of those prayers to fulfill the Rabbinic decree. See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 592:7.</i>.<br>How is this expressed? The <i>chazan</i> recites <i>Avot</i>, <i>Gevurot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> literally, ""mighty acts""; the second blessing of the <i>Amidah</i>, which begins: ""You are mighty,"" and recounts different expressions of God's power.</i></i>, the sanctification of God's name, <i>Malchuyot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Three additional blessings are recited in the musaf service of Rosh Hashanah: <i>Malchuyot</i> (acceptance of God's sovereignty), <i>Zichronot</i> (acknowledgement of God's remembrance of the Jewish people), and <i>Shofarot</i> (describing the significance of the sounding of the shofar).</p>
<p><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16a states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, declares: ""On Rosh Hashanah, recite before me <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot</i>.</p>
<p><i>Malchuyot</i> - so that you will crown Me as King over you.</p>
<p><i>Zichronot</i> - so that I will remember you for good.</p>
<p>By what means? Through the shofar.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These blessings are described in the following halachot.</p>
<p>The prayers mentioning the sacred nature of the holiday and the sacrifices which were offered in the Temple are also included in the <i>Malchuyot</i> blessing.</i></i> [ - at this point,] the shofar is sounded three times; <i>Zichronot</i> - the shofar is sounded three times; <i>S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> literally, ""the service,"" i.e., the blessing <i>R'tzey</i>, which asks God to accept our prayers and restore the Temple service.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the second series of <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> required by the Torah.</i>hofarot</i> - the shofar is sounded three times - [and concludes the <i>Amidah</i> with] the <i>Avodah</i>, an acknowledgement [of God's wonders], and the priestly blessing.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34b)</i>"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.8","These three intermediate blessings recited on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur of the <i>Yovel</i> - <i>M<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b) states: ""Rosh Hashanah and the <i>Yovel</i> are identical regarding the sounding of the shofar and the blessings.""</i>alchuyot, Zichronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot</i> - are each dependent on each other<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., a person who cannot recite all three blessings should not recite any. Generally, a person who does not know all the blessings of the <i>Amidah</i> should recite those that he knows. However, on the musaf service of Rosh Hashanah, a person should begin the <i>Amidah</i> only if he knows the entire service (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 593:2). (See also the <i>Bi'ur Halachah</i>.)</i>.<br>In each of these blessings, one is required to recite ten verses reflecting the content of the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in the commentary on the previous halachah</i> - three verses from the Torah, three from the Book of Psalms, and three from [the words of] the prophets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries question why the Book of Psalms is given prominence over the words of the prophets, when generally the prophets' statements are considered on a higher level of holiness. Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that chronologically, the Psalms were written before the prophecies quoted (<i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a).</p>
<p>Examples of the verses recited are mentioned in the following halachah and commentary.</i>. One concludes with a verse from the Torah. Should a person conclude with a verse from the prophets, he fulfills his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> after the fact. However, at the outset it is desirable to recite all ten verses.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, one should preferably conclude with a verse from the Torah. This is our present practice.</p>
<p>From the statements of the Rambam and the relevant passages from the Mishnah and Talmud, it would appear that originally there was no standard text containing universally accepted verses for these blessings. Rather, certain verses were commonly accepted and would be recited by almost all those who prayed. Others were left to the preference of each individual.</p>
<p>(One must remember that machzorim were uncommon in this period, and most of the prayers were recited by heart. Thus, the verses chosen by an individual might often have been those which he had been able to commit to memory.)</i>.<br>Should a person recite only one verse from the Torah, one from the sacred writings, and one from the prophets, he fulfills his obligation. Even if he states: ""In Your Torah, God, our Lord, it is written..."" and recites one verse from the Torah and concludes, nothing further is necessary."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.9","One should not recite [verses for] <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot</i> which describe [Divine] retribution; f<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since Rosh Hashanah is a day of judgement, we are careful not to mention any factors that might lead to negative repercussions. For this reason, no confessional prayers are recited on Rosh Hashanah, and extreme care is taken regarding all aspects of our prayers and speech. (See Maharsha, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b.)</i>or example, for <i>Zichronot</i>, [Psalms 78:39]: ""And He remembered that they were mere flesh...""; for <i>Malchuyot</i>, [Ezekiel 20:33]: ""With outpoured anger, I will reign over you...""; f<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a mentions that this prophecy concludes with the redemption of our people; since it is associated with anger and wrath, it is not fit to be mentioned on Rosh Hashanah.</i>or <i>Shofarot</i>, [Hoshea 5:8]: ""Blow the shofar in Givah...""<br>Similarly, <i>Zichronot</i> which are merely associated with an individual [should not be mentioned] even if they are of a positive nature - for example, [Psalms 106:4]: ""Remember me, O God, amidst the favor of Your people,"" [Nehemiah 5:19]: ""Remember me, my God, for good.""<br>V<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even though on Rosh Hashanah each man is judged individually, and his own personal future is determined (see <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16b; <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:3), it is desirable to look beyond these individual matters and concentrate our prayers on the welfare of the Jewish people as a whole.</i>erses using the verb פקד - for example, [Exodus 3:16]: ""I have surely taken note..."" - may not be included as <i>Zichronot</i>.

Indeed, the Targum of the cited verse in Genesis is דכיר, the Aramaic for ""remembered."" Furthermore, the Talmud mentions that Rabbi Yosse allowed verses using the verb פקד, and although Rabbi Yehudah objected, in differences of opinion between the two, Rabbi Yosse's position is generally favored. Nevertheless, since there are many verses that use the verb זכר, there is no difficulty in establishing a practice that will be accepted by all opinions (<i>Beit Yosef</i> 591).</i>ne may mention verses that refer to retribution to be visited upon the gentile nations - for example, [Psalms 99:1]: ""God is King, the nations will tremble...""; [Psalms 137:7]: ""Remember, O God, against the Edomites, the day of Jerusalem""; or [Zechariah 9:14]: ""God, the Lord, will sound the shofar and proceed in a southerly storm-wind.""<br>All the following verses: [Deuteronomy 6:4]: ""Hear Israel, God is our Lord, God is one""; [Deuteronomy 4:35]: ""To you, it has been revealed that you may know...""; and [Deuteronomy 4:39]: ""And you shall know today and draw it close to your heart..."" express the concept of God's sovereignty. Even though [these verses] do not explicitly mention His kingship, they are equivalent to [Exodus 16:18]: ""God will rule forever and ever""; and [Deuteronomy 33:5]: ""When He became King in Jeshurun."""
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.10","The following is the commonly accepted custom for blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Halachah 7 and the commentary, the Sages had originally ordained that a person hear the shofar blasts required by the Torah in the midst of the musaf service.

<blockquote>
<p>The common custom is to read on the first day: ""And God showed providence to Sarah..., and on the second day: ""And God presented a trial to Abraham...""</p>

<p>As stated in that halachah, the haftarah is recited after the Torah reading is concluded.</i> and returned to its place, the congregation is seated<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This practice is mentioned in <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16a and the <i>Sh'eltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon. However, today it is Ashkenazic custom to stand when hearing these shofar blasts. Nevertheless, based on this original practice, these are still referred to as <i>teki'ot meiyoshav</i> - ""the <i>teki'ot</i> sounded while seated.""</i>. One person stands and recites the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as required before the fulfillment of any positive commandment (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:1,2,8).</i>:
<blockquote>
Blessed are You, God, Lord of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to hear the sounding of the shofar.
</blockquote>
The entire congregation responds ""Amen."" He then recites the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i>, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as is necessary before the fulfillment of any mitzvah performed infrequently (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:9).</i>nd the entire congregation responds ""Amen"" to him.

The congregation stands and recites the musaf service<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in a hushed tone.</p>
<p>The <i>Tur</i> relates that there were varying customs regarding the recitation of the musaf service in a hushed tone. In certain communities, it had been customary for the congregation to recite the musaf prayers as on other festivals without reciting <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot</i>. Only the chazan would recite the latter. However, even in the <i>Tur's</i> time, the prevailing custom was that even the congregation recited these three blessings.</p>
<p>The <i>Sh'lah</i> records the custom of sounding the shofar for <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot,</i> and <i>Shofarot</i> while the congregation recites the <i>Amidah</i>. However, this custom is not accepted in all communities.</i>. After the chazan completes the fourth blessing - i.e., <i>Malchuyot</i> - a <i>teki'ah</i>, three <i>shevarim</i>, a [series of] <i>teru'ot</i>, and a <i>teki'ah</i> are sounded once.<br>He then recites the fifth blessing - i.e., <i>Zichronot</i>. After he completes the blessing, a <i>teki'ah</i>, three <i>shevarim</i>, and a <i>teki'ah</i> are sounded. He then recites the sixth blessing - i.e., <i>Shofarot</i>. After he completes the blessing, a <i>teki'ah</i>, a [series of] <i>teru'ot</i>, and a <i>teki'ah</i> are sounded once, and he concludes the prayers."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.11","The person who sounds the shofar while they are sitting<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the thirty shofar blasts mentioned in Halachah 3.</i> also sounds the shofar according to the order of blessings while they stand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Hai Gaon also mentions this practice. The <i>Kolbo</i> explains that it is appropriate, since ""when a person begins a mitzvah, we tell him to complete it"" (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 1:8). Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 592:7 writes that in many communities, it has become customary to divide the honor of shofar blowing between two individuals.</i>. He should not speak<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Permission is granted to speak about matters required for the prayers or for blowing the shofar (Ramah).</i> between the shofar blasts while the congregation is seated and those sounded while they stand. If he did talk between them, even though it is a transgression, he does not repeat the blessing."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.12","It is logical that each series of shofar blasts should be sounded three times for every blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Because of the doubt mentioned in Halachah 3, it would be proper for us to blow three series of blasts - i.e., <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah; teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>; and <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - at the conclusion of each blessing.</i>, as [the shofar] was sounded while [the congregation] was seated. However, since they<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the congregation</i> satisfied every possible doubt [by hearing] the shofar while seated, there is no need for the congregation to repeat them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and fulfilled the requirement of the Sages mentioned in Halachah 7.</p>
<p>In practice, a number of different customs are followed regarding this matter. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 592:1) suggests following the pattern described by the Rambam, but sounding each series three times, rather than once. The Ramah writes that Ashkenazic custom is to sound one series - <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - after each blessing. However, the <i>Sh'lah</i> suggests blowing three series of blasts - i.e., <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah; teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>; and <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - at the conclusion of each blessing.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> these shofar blasts</i> in their entirety during the order of blessings. Rather, it is sufficient for them to hear one series for each blessing, and they will thus have heard the shofar during the order of blessings.<br>All of the above applies only to a congregation. However, there is no [set] custom regarding an individual. He fulfills his obligation whether or not he hears [the shofar blasts] during the order of blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some authorities object to the permission granted by the Rambam for an individual to interrupt his recitation of the the <i>Amidah</i> in order to hear the sounding of the shofar. However, the Rambam's opinion is based on his interpretation of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34b. (See <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>.)</i>, whether seated or standing."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.13","The blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot,</i> and <i>Shofarot</i>.</i> are not dependent on the <i>teki'ot</i>, nor are the <i>teki'ot</i> dependent on the blessings.<br>W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, if it is impossible for a person to hear the blessings, he should still attempt to hear the shofar being blown.</i>hen there are two cities - in one it is known that there will definitely be someone to recite the nine blessings, but there is no one to blow the shofar - in the other, a doubt exists whether or not there will be someone to blow the shofar, one should go the latter, since the sounding of the shofar is a requirement of the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 1</i>, while the blessings are of Rabbinic origin."

The passage in <i>Kiddushin</i> continues to explain that such a person is unacceptable as a witness and the Rambam quotes that law (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 11:5).</p>
<p>The commentaries have attempted to resolve this difficulty in different ways: For example <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> (ibid.) explains that a common person is condemned only if he eats a full meal in the market place, while a wise man should not eat anything at all in public. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Edut</i>) differentiates between eating in a crowded place - which is forbidden for everyone - and eating in a quiet corner - which is deemed improper only for a Sage. The <i>Bach</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 34) explains that a common person is censored only for eating while walking through the market place, while the wise man should not eat in public even while standing in one place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this halachah, the Rambam uses the expression <i>chacham</i> (a wise man), his ideal for a person with a developed personality, and not <i>talmid chacham</i> (a Torah Sage). Apparently, he does not differentiate between a Torah Sage and a common person in this matter and requires a refined, highly developed standard in meeting our physical needs from everyone.</i>, unless there is a very pressing need, lest he be viewed without respect by others.<br>He<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the wise man</i> should not eat together with the unlearned<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sanhedrin</i> 52b states that, at the outset, a common person will consider a Torah Sage to be like a vessel of gold.

<p>Note <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11, where the Rambam equates the dining of a learned and pious man together with the unlearned with the desecration of the Name of God. See also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> (25:4) where he rules that communal leaders and judges should not eat and drink with the common people.</i>, nor at those tables that are ""filled with vomit and excrement."" He should not eat frequently in other places, even in the company of wise men, nor should he eat where there is a large gathering<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The reason for these restrictions is, as the Rambam expresses in the Guide to the Perplexed (ibid.), a basic desire for a person, particularly when he relates to others, to emphasize the refined and developed aspects of his being and not those which he shares with other animals. Therefore, even when there is no danger of subjecting himself to undesirable influences or disgracing the Torah with which he is identified, he should refrain from performing a physical activity like eating in the presence of others.</i>.<br>It is not fitting for him to eat at another person's [table] except at a feast associated with a mitzvah, e.g., a betrothal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This decision is not accepted by all authorities. Some do not consider such a betrothal feast as ""associated with a mitzvah.""</p>
<p><i>Erusin</i> translated as ""betrothal,"" refers to the first stage of the marriage process, i.e., giving the woman the wedding ring. In Talmudic and post-Talmudic times, this ceremony was carried out before the actual wedding (<i>nisuin</i>). At present, we perform the two stages of the wedding, <i>erusin</i> and <i>nisuin</i> together. Thus, reference to what we term engagement as <i>erusin</i> is technically a misnomer.</i> or wedding feast - and then, [only] when a scholar is marrying the daughter of a scholar.<br>The righteous and the pious of old never partook of a meal that was not their own."
Human Dispositions 5.3,"When a wise man drinks wine, he drinks only enough to soften the food in his stomach.<br>Whoever becomes drunk is a sinner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries cite <i>Berachot</i> 29b: ""Do not become drunk and do not sin;"" a passage which seems to say that drink leads to sins. There is room for question for it appears that the Rambam views drinking itself as sinful.</i>, is shameful, and will lose his wisdom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Proverbs 31:5: ""Lest he drink and forget the Law and pervert the judgement of all the poor.""</p>
<p>The Torah gives examples of the degrading effects of drunkenness (Noah, Genesis, Chapter 8; Lot, Genesis, Chapter 19). There are specific prohibitions against drinking - e.g. a priest is not allowed to perform the priestly services while under the influence of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9-11). Similarly, numerous passages throughout the Prophets and Sacred Writings castigate drunkenness. These are also paralleled in the rabbinic literature, e.g. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70a, <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 12.</i>. If he becomes drunk before the common people, he desecrates God's Name.<br>It is forbidden to drink even a small quantity of wine<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to the same degree as wine that is drunk without food. See the Rambam's commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:6.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:17 which considers a <i>revi'it</i> (between 3 and 5 oz.) of wine as slightly intoxicating. Since our wines are considerably weaker than those of the Rambam's time, it is questionable whether this measure would apply today.</i> in the afternoon hours, unless it is taken together with food. Drink that is taken together with food is not intoxicating. Only wine that is taken after the meal is to be avoided."
Human Dispositions 5.4,"Although a man's wife is permitted to him at all times, it is fitting that a wise man behave with holiness<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though a Jew's commitment to holiness must encompass every aspect of his behavior, the Torah and our Sages have always emphasized the importance of this quality in regard to sexuality. There is no more powerful expression of man's basic, instinctual nature than sex. Therefore, precisely in this area, a Jew must reveal that his nature is not only material, that he possesses a spiritual dimension that lies at the core of his being and seeks expression.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Jewish marriage bond is referred to as <i>Kiddushin</i>, emphasizing how <i>kedushah</i>, holiness, is a fundamental element in marriage. Similarly, Leviticus 20:7, proclaims ""Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am God, your Lord,"" as a preface to the laws proscribing forbidden intimate relations. <i>Sh'vuot</i> 18b interprets the above verse as also including a command to conduct oneself in a holy manner within permitted relationships.</p>
<p>The quality of holiness involves not only restraint, as mentioned in the ensuing statements, but also the manner in which relations are carried out. The Rambam elaborates on this aspect in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:9 and in his commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4.</i>. He should not frequent his wife like a rooster. Rather, [he should limit his relations to once a week]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ketubot</i> 62a,b describes the frequency with which people involved in different occupations should engage in intimate relations (See also <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 14:1-4.). The measure given here is the one allotted to Torah Sages.</i> from Sabbath evening to Sabbath evening, if he has the physical stamina.<br>When he speaks with her, he should not do so at the beginning of the night, when he is sated and his belly [is] full, nor at the end of the night, when he is hungry; rather, in the middle of the night, when his food has been digested<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Chagigah</i> 5b</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note Chapter 4, Halachah 19. <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> explains that both during the time food is being digested and when a person is hungry, his emotional balance is somewhat disturbed and it is difficult for him to develop the proper attitude and spiritual awareness necessary to make intimate relations a Godly act.</p>
<p><i>Nedarim</i> 20b emphasizes that the midnight hour also allows a person to rest from all his worldly involvement. The quiet of the hour prevents him from being disturbed by other thoughts and he is able to concentrate on his wife alone.</p>
<p>Despite the advantages of having relations at midnight, many contemporary authorities suggest that a couple not hold to this as a binding rule. If a couple have already begun thinking of sex, they should not be forced to wait until midnight to fulfill their desires.</p>
<p>He should not be excessively lightheaded, - Previously (Chapter 2, Halachah 7), the Rambam cited a mishnah (<i>Avot</i> 3:16) which links lightheadedness and immorality.</i>.<br>He should not be excessively lightheaded, nor should he talk obscene nonsense even in intimate conversation with his wife. Behold, the prophet has stated (Amos 4:13 : ""And He repeats to a man what he has spoken."" [On this verse,] our Sages commented: A person will have to account for even the light conversation that he has with his wife<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for every aspect of a man's behavior is significant.</i>.<br>[At the time of relations,] they should not be drunk, nor lackadaisical<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> People should not engage in relations except when motivated by desire (preferably a holy desire as explained in Chapter 3). For this reason, as mentioned below, a husband should spend time arousing his wife's desires.</i>, nor tense - [neither both of them,] or [even] one of them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The act of intimacy should be a true union between man and wife. Therefore, the partners must work on developing a single state of mind.</i>. She should not be asleep, nor should the man take her by force, against her will<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that this statement also implies that one should not compel his wife to agree to intimate relations. See <i>Eiruvin</i> 100b.</i>. Rather, [the relations should take place] amidst their mutual consent and joy. He should converse and dally with her somewhat, so that she be relaxed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;""><b>You should motivate her with words that move her heart and settle her mind and make her happy so that your mind will be fused with hers, and your intent with her intent.<br/>
You should say some things that arouse her desire, feelings of connection, love, will, and romance, and others which lead her to the fear of God, piety, and modesty.<br/></b></i>. He should be intimate [with her] modestly and not boldly, and withdraw [from her] immediately."
Human Dispositions 5.5,"Whoever conducts himself in this manner [may be assured that] not only does he sanctify his soul, purify himself, and refine his character, but, furthermore<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in addition to these spiritual and ethical benefits,...</i>, if he has children, they<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the offspring</i> will be handsome and modest, worthy of wisdom and piety<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">When a person joins together with his wife while his thoughts cleave to the spiritual realms, those thoughts draw down a sublime light which rests on that drop of semen... Thus, that drop of semen is always connected to that shining light.<br/>
This is the mystic secret implied in [God's words to the prophet, Jeremiah   1:5 ]: ""Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you;"" i.e., He had already established a connection of shining light with the sperm [from which] that Tzaddik [was conceived] at the time of [his parents'] union.</i>.<br>[In contrast,] whoever conducts himself in the ways of the rest of the people who walk in darkness, will have children like those people."
Human Dispositions 5.6,"Torah Sages conduct themselves with exceptional modesty<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With this statement, the Rambam establishes a connection with the previous halachah and sets the motif for what follows. Modesty is not simply a matter of dress, (this is discussed in halachah 9), but rather, an awareness of God which causes a person to cover head and body out of respect for the Divine Presence. The Rambam expands upon this concept in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Vol. III, Chapter 52):</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">He is constantly with us, observing us, as [Jeremiah 23:24] proclaims: 'Can a man hide himself in the secret places and I not see him,' says God."" Understand this well.<br/>
Know that when perfect men comprehend this, they achieve such humility, such awe and fear of God and a sense of shame before Him... that their private behavior with their wives and in latrines is like their public conduct with other people.<br/>
Know that they have forbidden a man to walk with an erect carriage, because: ""the entire world is filled with His glory"" (Isaiah 6:3 ... We are always in His presence... Thus, the greatest among the Sages found it difficult to bare their heads because the Divine Presence constantly hovers over man.</i>. They do not demean themselves and do not bare their heads or their bodies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (2:1) lays down the following general rule: Any portion of our bodies which is usually covered should not be revealed unless there is a specific reason for doing so.</p>
<p>Modesty, as understood in the present context, results from the awareness of the Divine Presence. The ordinary man experiences such awareness while at prayer when ""he is as if standing before the Divine Presence"" (<i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:16) and then he is required not to bare his head (ibid. 5:5) or various parts of his body; e.g., his chest (ibid. 4:7) and his feet (ibid. 5:5). As emphasized in Chapter 3, Halachah 3, a wise man should try to be conscious of the Divine Presence at all times and places. As a result, he will constantly be modest.</p>
<p>Though in Talmudic times and in the Rambam's era, personal modesty and covering one's head were considered the signs of a Sage (<i>Kiddushin</i> 8a) and a unique and special merit (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b), at present, both practices have been accepted as ordinary behavior for all observant Jews.</p>
<p>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. - <i>Tamid</i> 27b quotes Rav as giving his son the following advice: ""Sit and reveal yourself. Cover yourself and stand.""</i>.<br>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. He should not wipe himself clean with the right hand. He should stay away from all others and enter a chamber beyond a chamber, a cave within a cave, and relieve himself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 62b derives this law from I Samuel 24:3's description of the behavior of King Saul. Though it is forbidden to delay relieving oneself (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:31), our Sages did not give this prohibition precedence over the dictates of modesty (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 3:11).</i>. If he [must] relieve himself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These restrictions only apply to defecation. The Sages feared that refraining from urination might be damaging (<i>Bechorot</i> 44b).</i> behind a fence, he should move far enough away that no one can hear the sound if he breaks wind. If he [must] relieve himself in an open area<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> where such a barrier is not available</i>, he should be far enough off so that no one can see him baring himself.<br>One should not speak while relieving himself, even if there is great need<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 62a states that ""modesty and silence are appropriate for the latrine."" <i>Sanhedrin</i> 19a states that women are allowed to speak in the latrine to prevent men from entering.</i>. Just as he conducts himself with modesty while in the latrine by day, he should [also] do so at night.<br>One should always train himself to relieve himself in the early morning and after dark only, so that he [need] not go far off."
Sabbath 7.1,"With regard to the [forbidden] labors for which one is liable to be executed by stoning<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> when a forbidden labor is performed in the presence of witnesses who administer a warning (Chapter 1, Halachah 1)</i> or to receive <i>karet</i> if one transgresses willingly, or for which one is obligated to bring a sin offering if one commits the transgression unknowingly<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., one intended to perform the forbidden labor, but was not aware that doing so was breaking the Sabbath laws.</i>, there are primary categories and [their] derivatives.<br>The sum of all the primary categories of [forbidden] labor are forty minus one<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries question why the Rambam (and his source, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2, use this expression, rather than merely stating ""thirty-nine."" Some draw attention to the parallel found in the Mishnah's description of the number of lashes given a transgressor (<i>Makkot</i> 3:10). Others explain that this expression indicates that there is a fortieth activity - the spiritual service of prayer and study - which must be performed on the Sabbath day.</i>. They include:

<tbody><tr>
<td>1) plowing,<br/>
<br/>
2) sowing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Significantly, plowing is mentioned before sowing in the Mishnah. <i>Shabbat</i> 73b explains that this was done to teach that if the earth is hard, and it is necessary to re-plow the land after the first plowing, one is liable for the second plowing as well. The Rambam, however, follows the usual order of activities. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)</i>,<br>3) reaping,<br>4) collecting sheaves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that the reapers usually gather the grain in small sheaves. Others follow who collect these sheaves into larger bundles. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 5.)</p>
<p>According to one opinion in <i>Shabbat</i> 96b, there is an explicit reference to the prohibition of this labor on the Sabbath. Numbers, ch. 15, relates that a person was executed for collecting wood on the Sabbath. As the Rambam states Chapter 21, Halachah 11, this labor includes only the collection of produce. Gathering other substances - e.g., salt - is not included.

Implied is that nakedness, and also a place where people undress even if no naked people are there, is not appropriate for ""God to walk among you.""

Proverbs 17:5 states: ""The one who mocks the poor (<i>rash</i>) reproaches his Creator."" The Talmud also explains that this term also refers to the dead and derives many halachot regarding conduct in the presence of a corpse from this verse. It is forbidden to wear <i>tefillin</i> or carry a Torah scroll in a graveyard, since one would, in a certain sense, be mocking the dead, who are unable to perform mitzvot. This is the case regarding <i>Kri'at</i> Shema also.</i>. If he distances himself four cubits from the grave or the corpse, he is permitted to recite it.

One prohibits the <i>Shema</i> to be read near the excrement of dogs and pigs, and the other prohibits <i>Kri'at</i> Shema in the presence of these excrements only when skins are soaking in them. Ravvah prefers the second source, and the Rambam decides halachah in accordance with Ravvah's position.</p>
<p>Rashi explains that the idea of soaking skins applies only to the excrement of dogs and pigs, since it is a common practice to soak skins in them, but not to human feces, which is not used for such a purpose.</i>, or in the presence of any other feces like these that have a foul odor. This is also the case regarding human urine, but not animal urine.<br>O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., the <i>Shema</i> may be recited next to it. The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and quotes the Jerusalem Talmud, which includes donkey urine as one of those items that prohibit <i>Kri'at</i> Shema. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Talmud on which the Rambam based his decision most probably mentioned donkey dung (as mentioned in the previous comment) and not donkey urine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:6 reflects the position of the Ra'avad.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Asher points out that the Rambam mentions animal urine alone as not being problematic, thereby indicating that animal dung (e.g., cow or horse excrement) would be problematic. Rabbenu Asher himself sees no room to prohibit animal dung, since it is never mentioned in the Talmud as problematic. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> holds that the Rambam's position is that animal dung is prohibited only if its smell causes discomfort, and that the extent of this discomfort is somewhat subjective. Therefore, the Rambam did not mention it explicitly.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:4 rules in accordance with this understanding of the Rambam. (This is not surprising, since the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> were both written by Rav Yosef Karo.)</i>ne need not distance oneself from the feces or urine of a child unable to eat the weight of an olive of grain cereal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are five types of grain cereal - wheat, barley, oats, spelt and rye (See <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 5:1).</i>, in the time in which an adult could eat an amount equivalent to the weight of three eggs."
Reading the Shema 3.7,"One may not recite the <i>Shema</i> next to feces, even if they are as dry as a shard. However, if they were so dry that, if thrown away, t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 25a defines this as feces which when either: a) rolled, or b) thrown, they will not crumble. At such a time, they are regarded like a shard. The Rambam chooses the stricter of these two opinions - i.e., that if thrown it still retains its shape and is, therefore, forbidden (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>hey would crumble, one may recite the <i>Shema</i> facing them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, if they still emit a foul odor, the <i>Shema</i> may not be recited next to them, as mentioned in Halachah 12 in regard to a foul smell emanating from a substance (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>.<br>If urine that has been soaked up into the ground is still sufficiently wet to moisten one's hand, the <i>Shema</i> should not be recited facing it. If it has dried sufficiently, the <i>Shema</i> may be recited."
Reading the Shema 3.8,"How far must a person distance himself from feces or urine in order to recite the <i>Shema</i>? Four cubits<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah is based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 22b). In modern measure, a cubit is 48 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 57.7 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i>. This applies when they are at his side or behind him, but if they are in front of him, he should move until he cannot see them, and then recite [the <i>Shema</i>]."
Reading the Shema 3.9,"When does the above apply?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., that one must distance oneself four cubits from urine and feces.</i> When he is in an enclosure with them, and they are on the same level. However, if they are 10 handbreadths higher or lower than he<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> he is considered to be in a different place, (<i>Berachot</i> 25b) and...</i>, he may sit next to them and recite the <i>Shema</i>, since there is a space separating them.<br>The above applies provided no foul smell reaches him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is not mentioned in the <i>beraita</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 25a. However, immediately after the halachah regarding separations, the <i>beraita</i> then states that a foul smell emanating from a solid substance prohibits recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. Hence, the Rambam associates the two halachot.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions that, based on the Rambam's position, one should be careful not to recite the <i>Shema</i> or pray in a house with a foul odor, even if the odor is emanating from a different house. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:2 quotes this, but also mentions the positions of Rabbenu Yonah and Rabbenu Asher, that a separation is sufficient even if an odor remains.</p>
<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> suggests that it is best to be strict in such a case. However, he grants one leniency. Generally, one must distance oneself from an odor even if he himself cannot smell it. However, in this instance, a lack of smell would be enough to permit the reading of the <i>Shema</i>.</i>. Similarly, if he were to cover the feces or urine with a vessel, it would be considered as buried, even though it would still be in the room, and it is permitted to recite [the <i>Shema</i>] next to it."
Reading the Shema 3.10,"A person who is separated from feces by a glass partition, may recite the <i>Shema</i> next to them even if he can still see them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 25b equates this with a case where the feces are covered.</i>. If a quarter <i>log</i> of water is added to the urine of one micturition, the <i>Shema</i> may be recited within four cubits of it."
Reading the Shema 3.11,"If feces are found in a hole in the ground<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Berachot</i> 25b.</i>, a person may stand with his shoe over the hole and recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, his shoe may not touch the feces<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 25a states simply “if there are feces on one's skin.” The Rambam explains this as referring to a residue of feces - i.e., a stain, with no actual substance.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Asher explains that this applies when there is actual substance on the person's skin, but it is covered by his clothing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 76:4 reflects the understanding of Rabbenu Asher. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> favors the Rambam's position.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> After stating the halachah that one may put one's shoe on top of the hole in the ground, <i>Berachot</i> 25b questions the law when excreta is stuck to a person's shoe, and leaves the question unresolved (תיקו). Accordingly, the more stringent opinion is followed.</p>
<p>The Rambam explains that this applies if there is any contact between the shoe and the feces. However, the Ra'avad maintains that this only applies when the feces are actually stuck to the shoe. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>.) 76:2 supports the Rambam's position.</i>.<br>If one finds very small feces, the size of a drop, he may expectorate thick saliva upon it to cover it, and then recite the <i>Shema</i>.<br>When there is a residue of feces on one's skin or one's hands are dirty from the washroom, if - because of the small quantity or its dryness - there is no foul odor, he may recite the <i>Shema</i>, since there is no foul odor.<br>However, if it is still in its place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., his anal opening</i>, even if not visible when he stands, since it is visible when he sits, he is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> until he cleans himself very well. This is because of the moist nature and foul smell of the feces.<br>Many <i>Geonim</i> taught that one is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> if one's hands are soiled<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The position of Rabbenu Chananel mentioned above.</i>, and it is proper to heed their teaching."
Reading the Shema 3.12,"[When the source of] a foul odor has substance<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., feces are found on the ground and a foul odor is emanating from them (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 25a).</i>, one may distance himself four cubits and recite the <i>Shema</i> provided the odor has subsided<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach points out that this halachah applies only in the case where the substance is to his side or behind him. However, if the substance is in front of him, we have already learned in Halachah 8 that he must distance himself until he can no longer see it.</i>. If it has not subsided, he should distance himself further until it ceases.<br>If [the odor] is not emanating from an actual substance<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., it is the result of someone passing gas - he - does not necessarily have to distance himself four cubits.

Reading the Shema 3.13,"It is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> while facing moving excreta<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 25a mentions a difference of opinion between Ravvah and Abbaye about this case. Abbaye holds that one is permitted to recite the <i>Shema</i> next to moving excreta, while Ravvah forbids it.</p>
<p>[The Babylonian Talmud is so full of disagreements between these two Torah scholars that it is called the book of the arguments between Ravvah and Abbaye. Among all these arguments, the halachah reflects Abbaye's position only six times. Here, also, the halachah is in line with Ravvah's opinion.]</i> - e.g., excreta floating on the water. The mouth of a pig is regarded as moving excreta. Therefore, the <i>Shema</i> may not be recited facing it, until it has moved four cubits away."

Rather, he should stop reciting until he has passed this particular place.<br>Similarly, if one is reciting [the <i>Shema</i>] and passes gas, he should stop until the odor subsides<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for this is an odor that does not emanate from a solid substance as first mentioned in Halachah 12.

If the doubt exists only regarding urine, however, the <i>Shema</i> may be recited even in a garbage heap."
Reading the Shema 3.16,"Just as it is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> where there are feces or urine until one distances himself from it, so, too, the <i>Shema</i> may not be recited in the presence of nakedness<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The previous <i>halachot</i> in this chapter have dealt with the prohibition of reciting the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of unclean substances and foul odors.

<p>The succeeding words in that verse - ולא יראה בך ערות דבר - ""Let Him not see any nakedness among you"" serve as the basis for halachot that follow in this chapter.

However, the prohibition regarding nakedness is one of sight: לא יראה בך (It shall not be seen among you), and one sees through glass perfectly.</i>.<br>Any part of a woman's body is regarded as ervah.

Reading the Shema 3.18,"When two people are lying under one sheet<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> without clothing</i>, each is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> even if he has covered himself below his heart, unless the sheet also separates between them in a manner that prevents their bodies from touching<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 24a records a difference of opinion between Rav Yosef and Shmuel.

Blessings 5.1,"Women and slaves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> whose Torah obligations are equivalent (<i>Chagigah</i> 4a)</i> are obligated to recite grace.

See <i>Kiddushin</i> (1:7). Since the obligation to recite grace is constant, whether one eats during the day or at night, it would appear that women are obligated. Some commentaries point to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 19) and the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 3:3 and <i>Kiddushin</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) as indications that the Rambam supports the view that a woman's obligation for grace stems from the Torah.</i>, or whether their obligation does not stem from the Torah. Therefore<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., because of this doubt</i>, they should not fulfill the obligation of grace on behalf of others<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 11, a person can only recite a blessing on behalf of another person if he shares an equal obligation himself.</i>.

(In <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:13 and <i>Hilchot Chagigah</i> 2:3, however, the Rambam states that the obligation to train a child to fulfill these mitzvot lies on the father.)</p>
<p>The hypothesis that the obligation lies on the child is supported by Halachah 16, which states that a child may fulfill the obligation of grace for a person who did not eat to the point of satisfaction (and, therefore, is obligated to recite grace only by Rabbinic decree). Were the Sages to have placed the obligation to educate the child on his father and not on the child himself, the child would not be able to fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of another person.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is possible to explain that the Sages placed the obligation on the father. This obligation, however, encompasses the child and, hence, causes him to be considered as obligated in the mitzvah (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 17).</i> by virtue of Rabbinic decree, in order to educate them to perform mitzvot."

<p>In <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 2:10, the Rambam explains that we are obligated to rely on the day established Rosh Chodesh by the Jewish court. This matter was handed over to them completely. God, who commanded the observance of the holiday, commanded us to rely on them.</p>
<p>This concept is based on the verse in Leviticus 23:4: ""These are the appointed days of God, sacred days, that you shall designate them in their appointed time.""

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.9,"Before the first blessing of each and every Amidah-prayer, one states: ""God, open my lips, and my mouth will utter Your praise"" [Psalms 51:17]. Upon concluding the prayer, he says: ""May the utterances of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be in accordance with Your will, O God, my Rock and Redeemer"" [Psalms 19:15]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This verse is particularly apt for recitation after the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Proper intention during the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is a very difficult matter (See Chapter 4, Halachah 15). Therefore, at the end of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> we ask God to heed our words in any case:</p>
<p>""May the utterances of my mouth..."" - meaning to say: May the words which I uttered in the midst of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> be accepted by You even if my intention was not complete and my mouth acted independently of my heart and mind.

<p>Rabbenu Yonah explains that this verse must be understood in conjunction with the verse that follows it: ""You do not desire that I offer sacrifices; a burnt offering, You do not want:"" (Psalms 51:18 . After his relations with Bathsheva, King David realized that he could not attain forgiveness by offering a sacrifice, since a sacrifice is accepted only after an act done unwittingly. Therefore, he asked that God assist him in finding the proper means of expression through prayer to achieve atonement.</p>
<p>We, too, are in a similar situation for we have no Temple and our prayers were instituted in the place of our sacrifices. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 5.) Accordingly, we ask God to assist us in our desire to utter His praises, and request our needs in such a way that it will be desirable to Him.</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 4b raises a question regarding the recitation of this verse before <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Rabbi Yochanan himself states that one who starts the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> immediately after the blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, גאל ישראל (Who redeemed Israel) is called a person of the World to Come. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 18, where the Rambam mentions this halachah.)</p>
<p>Why is the recitation of this verse not considered an interruption between the blessing and the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>? The Talmud answers that this verse is considered as an integral part of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and thus, is viewed as a ""long prayer.""</i>teps backwards."

(See the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 530-548 for the laws of Chol Hamo'ed.)</i>, one recites 19 blessings in the Evening Prayer, Morning Prayer, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayer as on other days.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.13,"On Chanukah and Purim, one adds ""For the miracles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Both Chanukah and Purim are commemorated with the same basic prayer, על הניסים.

<p><i>Shabbat</i> 24a, which discusses the laws of Chanukah, is the source for this prayer. However, this Talmudic passage mentions only Chanukah, and not Purim. However, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi quotes a <i>Tosefta</i> from <i>Berachot</i> which equates Chanukah and Purim.</p>
<p><i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quotes Rav Amram Gaon that על הניסים is not recited at night on Purim because we have not yet read <i>Megillat Esther</i>. This position is not accepted.

Rashi explains that this is <i>aneinu</i> (Answer us...), a prayer of supplication asking God to look down upon us with favor and not hide His countenance from us because of our wrongdoing.</i>..."" in ""the One who hears prayer.""<br>The leader of the congregation recites it as an independent blessing between ""the One who redeems Israel"" and ""the One who heals...,"" and concludes with ""the One who answers in times of trouble."" Thus, he recites 20 blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is based on the passage from <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b quoted above. A clear distinction is made between the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> uttered by all the congregants and the repetition recited aloud by the שליח ציבור (leader of the congregation). The שליח ציבור does establish for himself, as representative of the community as a whole, an independent blessing relevant to the fast day. Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.</p>
<p>There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the שליח ציבור to recite עננו in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3). (See the <i>Bi'ur Halacha</i> who holds that at least ten people must intend to fast in order for the שליח ציבור to recite עננו.)</i>.<br>On the ninth of Av, one adds [the following] to the blessing of ""the One who rebuilds Jerusalem<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the eleventh intermediate blessing of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. It is appropriate that the addition regarding the ninth of Av be placed in this blessing, which speaks of rebuilding Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Despite this logic, there is some question regarding the inclusion of this prayer in this blessing. The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the עבודה (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the הודאה (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in הודאה, while prayers regarding the future are placed in עבודה.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in בונה ירושלים (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of שומע תפילה (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of בונה ירושלים.

[Since Leviticus 19:27] states: ""Do not cut off the corners of your heads and do not destroy the corners of your beards,"" [an association between the two prohibitions is established].

Accordingly, slaves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> whose performance of mitzvot is generally equated with that of women (<i>Chaggigah</i> 4a)</i> are forbidden to cut off the corners of their heads, since they do possess beards."

<p>In addition, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> and <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> explain that by mentioning the fact that gentile priests remove their facial hair, the Rambam implies that removing such hair violates the prohibition of following ""the paths of the gentiles.""

<p>Many contemporary authorities have explained that in addition to all these points, growing a beard has been accepted as a sign that a person is God-fearing and precise in his observance of the mitzvot.

Though the Ashkenazic community follows his view, in Egypt and in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> the priests have always fulfilled the mitzvah of blessing the people every day.

Also, in Halachah 14, the Rambam mentions that the priests would bless the people while standing on the steps of the Temple building.</p>
<p>The Radbaz (Vol. II, <i>Leshonot HaRambam</i>) offers a resolution to this difficulty, noting that priests with disqualifying physical deformities may not stand on the Temple steps (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:20).

The <i>Prishah</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 284:7) relates that this custom was instituted after Goliath's iron helmet split open before David's stone. God promised iron that, in recognition of its act on behalf of the Jews, they would use it for a positive purpose in future generations. The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:1) refers to the use of iron utensils for circumcision as an accepted custom.</i> - either scissors or a knife. Throughout the Jewish community, it has become customary to use a knife."
Circumcision 2.2,"How is the circumcision performed?

Today, there are authorities who suggest the use of a pipette because of the danger that the <i>mohel</i> could contract AIDS.</i>fterwards, one should suck the place of the circumcision until all the blood in the further reaches is extracted, lest a dangerous situation arise.

Reading the Shema 2.3,"A person who is walking on foot must stop for the first verse<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in order to concentrate his attention.</p>
<p><i>Berachot</i> 13b mentions two opinions regarding the extent of the <i>Shema</i> one must recite before he may continue on his way:<br/>
that of Rav Yehudah which requires the first two verses of the <i>Shema</i> to be recited standing;<br/>
and that of Rabbi Yochanan which requires the entire <i>Shema</i> to be recited in a stationary position.</p>
<p>Rav Yitzchak Alfasi explains that the actual halachah does not follow either of these positions, but rather is in accordance with the view of Rabbi Meir that only the first verse requires absolute intention. (See Halachah 1.)</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 63:3 also accepts this decision.</i>. He may recite the rest while walking.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the majority of the <i>Rishonim</i> hold that this is the case on the condition that he nevertheless manages to recite the rest of the <i>Shema</i>, albeit in a drowsy state.</p>
<p>Thus, our halachah mentions the necessity of alertness for the first verse within the context of the halachot of the intention required to read the <i>Shema</i>. In Halachah 12, the Rambam discusses sleepiness within the context of the need for proper enunciation of the words of the <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. That halachah supports the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> position that one fulfills one's obligation only if he also recites the rest of the <i>Shema</i>.</i>. From that point on, if he is overcome by sleep, we are not obligated to disturb him."
Reading the Shema 2.4,"A person who is involved in work must stop while he recites the whole first section<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Yitzchak Alfasi explains that this applies even according to the halachically accepted position of Rabbi Meir, that utmost concentration is necessary for the first verse only. (See the commentary on Halachah 1.)</p>
<p>The obligation to have proper concentration and the necessity that one's recitation of the <i>Shema</i> not appear haphazard are two different halachic requirements.</i>.

The acceptance of the yoke of God's kingship in the <i>Shema</i> is fundamentally necessary even for a person with such an all encompassing commitment to Torah.</p>

However, the Mishnah adds that were one to start doing one of these prohibited actions, he need not stop. The Rambam also applies these principles to <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). The Ra'avad (based on <i>Sukkah</i> 38a) differs and holds that a person must interrupt his meal in order to read the <i>Shema</i>.</i> or is involved in court, should complete [his task] and recite the <i>Shema</i> afterwards.

Reading the Shema 2.8,"While reciting the Shema, one should not gesture with his eyes or lips, or point with his fingers, in order that his reading not be haphazard. If one were to do this, although he does fulfill his obligation, he has acted improperly<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Yoma</i> ( <i>op. cit.</i>) refers to Isaiah 43:22: ""And you have not called upon Me, Jacob,"" implying that such a casual reading of the <i>Shema</i> is not considered as calling to God.</p>
<p>The Maharsha explains an added implication of the above verse. Rashi, in his commentary to Genesis 46:29, relates that when Jacob was first reunited with Joseph he made no response because he was reciting the <i>Shema</i> at that time. Surely, one who gestures while reading the <i>Shema</i> has certainly not achieved the level of devotion.</i>.<br>One should recite the <i>Shema</i> so that his words are audible to himself.

<p class=""rambam_indented"">One who recites the <i>Shema</i> so that the words are not audible to himself has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yosse says that he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he reads, but does not enunciate clearly: Rabbi Yosse says that he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yehudah says that he has not.</p>
<p>The Talmud concludes (<i>ibid.</i> 15b) that the halachah is in accordance with the lenient position in both cases - i.e., the anonymous opinion in the first case and Rabbi Yosse in the second.</p>
<p>Rav Yitzchak Alfasi adds that this is only after the fact. A priori (לכתחילה), one must read in such a way as to be audible to himself and enunciate the letters clearly. The Rambam follows this view.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one must at least mouth the words of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, even if he does not pronounce them loudly enough that they are audible to himself. Thought is not regarded like speech. (See the commentary on Halachah 3.) Therefore, one who does not even move his lips, but just thinks about the words as he ""reads"" them, does not fulfill his obligation (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 62:3).</i>. One must enunciate the letters clearly. [However, even] if he does not do this, he fulfills his obligation.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Yoma</i> 19b distinguishes between the first section of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and the second in this regard, forbidding these activities only during the recitation of the first section. Indeed, in Halachah 4 which also deals with a ""haphazard"" recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, the Rambam, himself makes such a distinction.</p>
<p>Indeed, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam relies on his statements in Halachah 4. Rabbenu Manoach explains that the Rambam did not clarify the matter explicitly lest he cheapen the value of the second section in the eyes of his reader. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that although making such gestures in the second section is not as ""improper"" as during the first, doing so is, nevertheless, prohibited.</i>"

There are other cases in <i>Kri'at Shema</i> where this problem arises, such as <i>veahavta et</i> (Deuteronomy 6:5 . In all these cases care must be exercised to separate the words clearly.</p>

If one becomes confused and forgets which section he has just completed, he should return to the first section - i.e., ""And you shall love God, your Lord"" (Deuteronomy 6:5 ."
Reading the Shema 2.14,"A person who errs in the middle of a section and is unaware of where he paused, should return to the beginning of that section.<br>One who recited וכתבתם (<i>uch'tavtam</i>) but does not know whether or not he recited <i>uch'tavtam</i> of [the section of] ""<i>Shema</i>"" or of [the section of] והיה אם שמוע (And if you will listen), should return to <i>uch'tavtam</i> of ""<i>Shema</i>.""

Reading the Shema 2.15,"[The following rules apply when] one encounters other people or is approached by them while reciting the <i>Shema</i>. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Having discussed in the previous halachot the proper reaction to unintentional interruptions in <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, the Rambam now discusses when one must purposefully interrupt his reading of the <i>Shema</i> in order to greet people or respond to their greetings.</p>
<p>These halachot are based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 13a):</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">""Between sections, one may initiate greetings out of respect, and respond. In the middle [of a section], one may initiate greetings out of fear, and respond,"" these are the words of Rabbi Meir.<br/>
Rabbi Yehudah says: ""In the middle [of a section] one may initiate contact out of respect, and respond out of fear.

<p class=""rambam_indented"">Just as a person is commanded to honor his father and fear him, so too, is he obligated to honor and fear his teacher. Indeed, his teacher deserves more than his father. His father brought him into the life of this world, while his teacher... brings him to the life of the world to come.</i> or anyone greater than he in learning. He may return the greetings of any person who initiates the friendly exchange.<br/>"
Reading the Shema 2.16," If one is in the middle [of a section], he may stop and initiate an exchange of greetings only with someone of whom he is afraid - e.g., a king or tyrant<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The term מפני היראה (out of fear) used in the abovementioned Mishnah refers to a king or tyrant - i.e., someone of whom one is physically afraid.</p>
<p>Rashi explains fear as referring to someone who one is afraid will kill him. Rabbenu Asher takes issue with Rashi's explanation of fear. He points out that it is unnecessary for the Mishnah to inform us that in the case of פיקוח נפש (a life-threatening situation), one may interrupt <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. Even violation of the Shabbat is permitted in such instances.</p>
<p>Therefore, Rabbenu Asher explains ""out of fear"" as referring to one's father or rabbi: איש את אימו ואת אביו תיראו (Every person must revere his mother and father) (Leviticus 19:3 . We also learn in <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 4:12 and <i>Pesachim</i> 108a that the fear of one's rabbi is similar to the fear of Heaven. See also <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 5:1.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 66:1 accepts Rashi's position regarding honor and Rabbenu Asher's interpretation of fear. He also mentions the Rambam's understanding of ""out of fear,"" as referring to a king or tyrant - this refers to one who is likely to cause pain or sorrow (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>. However, he may return the greetings of those he is obligated to honor - e.g., his father or his teacher."

<p>Accordingly, though it is forbidden to make an interruption between the recitation of a blessing before a mitzvah and the actual fulfillment of the mitzvah, these interruptions are permitted between the blessings before the <i>Shema</i> and the <i>Shema</i>.

Reading the Shema 4.1,"Women<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">A woman's exemption from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is obvious. It is a time-oriented commandment [i.e., the <i>Shema</i> must be recited at specific times and is thus classified as ""time-oriented"" (see Chapter 1, Halachot 9 to 13)], and women are exempt from all such commandments.<br/>
What might I have thought? That since [<i>Kri'at Shema</i>] contains the acceptance of the sovereignty of Heaven [even women would be called upon to recite it.<br/>
It [i.e., the Mishnah] teaches that this is not so and that women are indeed exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.</p>
<p>In terms of actual halachic ruling, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:1 rules that although women have no obligation, even rabbinic, to recite the <i>Shema</i>, it is proper that they do so in order to accept upon themselves the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven.</p>
<p>Women are also exempt from the blessings before <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but are obligated to recite the blessings after it, because there is a mention of the Exodus from Egypt, which women are also obligated to remember and mention (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 70:1).</p>
<p>The <i>Aruch Hashulchan</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 70:1) also mentions that women may recite all the blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and adds that the women of his area (Russia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century) were accustomed to do so, and that they should be blessed for their meritorious actions.</p>
<p>The responsa, <i>Yabia Omer</i> (2:6), states that women of Sephardic origin are not accustomed to recite the blessings. However, <i>Kaf HaChayim</i> rules that they may.</p>
<p>slaves - This refers to Canaanite slaves who have been sold to a Jewish owner and are obligated by all the commandments that women are obligated to perform. A halachic comparison between the two is found in <i>Chaggigah</i> 4a and <i>Kiddushin</i> 23a.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Talmud quotes a separate source for the exemption of slaves: ""Hear O Israel, God our Lord, God is One"" (Deuteronomy 6:4 . He who has no master other than the Almighty [is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>], thus exempting the slave, who has another master.</p>
<p><i>Chaggigah</i> 4a also derives the halachah in a similar fashion, albeit from a different verse.</i>, slaves and children are exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. We should teach children to recite it at the proper time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The latter point represents a difference in opinion between Rashi and the Rambam. The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 20a, states that children are free from the obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i>. Rashi states that they are entirely free of obligation even according to Rabbinic law because their parents may not be available at the specific times at which the <i>Shema</i> must be recited.</p>
<p>The Rambam and Rabbenu Tam differ and maintain that the mishnah is only referring to the obligations according to Torah law, but according to Rabbinic decree they are obligated. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:2 rules in accordance with the Rambam and Rabbenu Tam.</i> with the blessings before and after it, in order to educate them regarding the commandments.<br>One who is preoccupied and in an anxious state regarding a religious duty<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 16b differentiates between a bridegroom, who is exempt because of his involvement in a mitzvah, and one whose ship is sinking in the sea. Though the latter individual is also anxious, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, because his preoccupation is not with regard to a commandment.</i> is exempt from all commandments, including <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., even though it contains an acceptance of the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven, he is still exempt.</p>
<p>The phrase, Deuteronomy 6:7, ובשבתך בביתך (and while you are sitting in your house) implies that the obligation is only incumbent on someone who is involved in his own personal affairs - ""your house."" Thus, it excludes one who is involved in the performance of a mitzvah (<i>Berachot</i> 11a and 16a).</i>herefore, a bridegroom whose bride is a virgin is exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> until he has consummated the marriage, because he is distracted lest he not find her a virgin<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained above. Rabbenu Manoach writes in the name of the Ra'avad that the bridegroom is exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> only if he is able to have relations with his wife. However, if she is menstruating or sick, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach also discusses the different views regarding the bridegroom's obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> during the day if he does not engage in relations the first night. He concludes that he should be obligated since ""the Jews are a holy people and the bridegroom will be able to divert his thoughts from his wife and concentrate on reciting the <i>Shema</i>.""</i>.<br>However, if he delays until Saturday night after the wedding and does not have relations with her, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i> from that time onward, since his mind has settled and he is familiar with her even though they have not consummated the marriage."
Reading the Shema 4.2,"However, one who marries a woman who is not a virgin is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, b<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> on his wedding night</i>ecause even though he, too, is involved in the performance of a mitzvah, it is not so distracting<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for there is no question of the woman's virginity.</i>.

Reading the Shema 4.6,"After the burial, the mourners return to receive condolences and the people follow them from the gravesite to the place where they form a line to receive condolences.

<p>The above is conditional upon there being enough time afterwards to recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, if the third hour is passing, the <i>Shema</i> should be recited immediately (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). The Ramah quotes this halachah in <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 72:4.

Deuteronomy 23:13 teaches: ""And your camp shall be holy,"" forbidding the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of physical filth. In contrast, the verse from Jeremiah quoted above clearly implies the inability of ritual impurity to exert its influence over the words of Torah (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>."" Just as fire is incapable of becoming ritually impure, so, too, the words of Torah are never defiled."
Human Dispositions 3.1,"A person might say, ""Since envy, desire, [the pursuit] of honor, and the like, are a wrong path and drive a person from the world<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With these statements, the Rambam obviously refers to the mishnah from <i>Avot</i> which he quoted at the conclusion of the previous chapter. Having decried the traits mentioned there, he explains that his condemnation is directed against excessive materialism, but not against all involvement in worldly affairs.</i>, I shall separate from them to a very great degree and move away from them to the opposite extreme."" For example, he will not eat meat, nor drink wine, nor live in a pleasant home, nor wear fine clothing, but, rather, [wear] sackcloth and coarse wool and the like<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam makes a similar - but more lengthy - condemnation of asceticism. There he also mentions other ascetic practices - refraining from sleep and seeking solitude in the mountains and deserts.</i> - just as the pagan priests do.<br>This, too, is a bad path and it is forbidden to walk upon it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that, at certain times, many of the pious adopted ascetic practices as a safeguard against excessive involvement in materialism. However, they never regarded such practices as a goal in their own right. Others observed their behavior and mistook asceticism for an end rather than a means to achieve the middle path.</p>
<p>From the Rambam's statements in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, it would appear that there are two drawbacks to asceticism:<br/>
a) It might lead a person to poor health, illness, and a lack of strength which would prevent him from serving God as the Rambam states in Halachah 3.<br/>
b) A person might err and feel that he has fulfilled his obligation to serve God through these ascetic practices. As a result, he may never feel the need to dedicate himself to the service of God as He prescribed in the Torah.</p>
<p>There is a third disadvantage that is stressed heavily by the teachings of Kabbalah and Chassidut and may be hinted at by the Rambam's statements in the following halachot.</p>
<p>The <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 42b) states that God created the world ""in order to let Himself be known."" Similarly, <i>Tanya</i> (Chapter 33) explains that God created the world because He desired to have a dwelling place in the lower worlds. Thus, a person who tends to otherworldliness and asceticism, defeats God's purpose in creation.</i>. Whoever follows this path is called a sinner [as implied by Numbers 6:11's] statement concerning a nazarite: ""and he [the priest] shall make an atonement for him, for his having sinned regarding [his] soul."" Our sages declared:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a. [Interestingly, the author of this statement, Rabbi Eliezer HaKfar, is also the author of the statement (<i>Avot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) that ""envy, desire, and the pursuit of honor, drive a person from the world.""]</i> If the nazarite who abstained only from wine requires atonement, how much more so does one who abstains from everything.<br>Therefore, our Sages directed man to abstain only from those things which the Torah denies him and not to forbid himself permitted things by vows and oaths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> One should not conclude that the Rambam completely disapproves of vows and oaths. At the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> (13:23), the Rambam states: ""Whoever takes a vow in order to stabilize his temperaments and correct his deeds, is zealous and praiseworthy.""</p>
<p>In <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, he gives examples of people who were excessively inclined to a particular quality who take vows to correct their faults (in a manner reminiscent of his advice in the beginning of Chapter 2 of these halachot). Rather, what the Rambam criticizes in our halachah is abstention for the sake of abstention.</i> [of abstention]. Thus, our Sages stated:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Nedarim</i> 9:1</i> Are not those things which the Torah has prohibited sufficient for you that you must forbid additional things to yourself?<br>This general statement also refers to those who fast constantly.

Of all the above, and their like, Solomon directed and said: ""Do not be overly righteous and do not be overly clever; why make yourself desolate?"" (Ecclesiastes 7:16 ."
Human Dispositions 3.2,"A person should direct his heart and the totality of his behavior to one goal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 5, the Rambam addresses himself to many of the concepts mentioned in this and the following halachah. He begins that chapter with the declaration:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">A person must control all the powers of his soul with [his] intellect... and concentrate on a single goal at all times: To comprehend God, blessed be He, to the extent that man can know Him.<br/>
All of his activities: what he does, the way he rests, and what he says should lead to this goal.</i>, becoming aware of God, blessed be He. The [way] he rests, rises, and speaks should all be directed to this end<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In the previous Halachah, the Rambam condemned asceticism and otherworldliness. In this Halachah, he stresses the desired intent of our worldly involvement, to know God.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, Halachah 6, the Rambam introduced a religious component into the development of an ethical personalty, pointing out that we must ""imitate"" God's qualities. In this halachah, he adds a further point. All of man's actions are to be taken in an atmosphere of God-awareness.</p>
<p>The concept of knowing God recalls the opening Halachah of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">The fundamental [principle] upon which all fundamental [principles are based] and the pillar of the wisdoms is to know that there is a Primary Being.</p>
<p>In both halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the knowledge of God is not an abstract, intellectual past-time, but rather an all- encompassing commitment, embracing every aspect of our experience. Torah living does not confine God to the synagogue or the house of study, but provides us with a means to relate to Him within every dimension of our lives (<i>Al HaTeshuvah</i>).</p>
<p>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. - i.e., he should not view the acquisition of money as an end in its own right.</i>.<br>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. Rather, he should do these things, so that he will be able to obtain that which the body needs - food, drink, a home and a wife<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, as the Rambam continues in the following Halachah, the maintenance of physical well-being is also not an end in its own right. Rather, it is also only a means for the service of God.</p>
<p>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also uses the expression ""solely for pleasure,"" indicating that the Rambam does not advocate a life without physical pleasure. (Note also the passage from the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, quoted below.)</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with enjoying food, for example, as long as one does so within the framework of maintaining health. Indeed, in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how one may use pleasure to encourage himself to perform the acts necessary to maintain his health.</i>.<br>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure to the point where he will eat and drink only that which is sweet to the palate and engage in intercourse for pleasure. Rather, he should take care to eat and drink only in order to be healthy in body and limb.<br>Therefore, he should not eat all that the palate desires like a dog or a donkey<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam states: ""In such an activity, a person is just like an animal. It is not an action man undertakes because he is a man, but rather, one that he undertakes because he is an animal.""</i>. Rather, he should eat what is beneficial for the body, be it bitter or sweet. Conversely, he should not eat what is harmful to the body, even though it is sweet to the palate. For example: a person with a warm constitution should not eat meat or honey, nor drink wine, as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (Proverbs 25:27 . One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, f<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> this is given as a remedy for a warm liver constitution (Maimonides' Medical Aphorisms).</i>or then, he will be eating and drinking for medical reasons only, in order to become healthy and be whole - for a man cannot exist without eating and drinking.<br>Similarly, he should not have intercourse except to keep his body healthy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 4, Halachah 19, for a discussion of this matter.</i> and to preserve the [human] race. Therefore, he should not engage in intercourse whenever he feels desire<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See also Chapter 5, Halachah 4, which discusses the frequency of intimate relations.</i>, but when he knows that he requires a seminal emission for medical reasons or in order to preserve the [human] race."
Human Dispositions 3.3,"A person who accustoms himself to live by [the rules of] medicine does not follow a proper path if his sole intention is that his entire body and limbs be healthy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam puts the maintenance of health mentioned in the previous halachah into proper perspective. It is not to be pursued as a goal in its own right. Rather, it should be appreciated as merely a means to enable one to reach an awareness of God. The Rambam develops this idea at length in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> Chapter 5. There, he states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">A person should have the intention while eating, drinking, having intercourse, sleeping, awakening, moving, and resting, [that he does so] for the purpose of his physical health alone.<br/>
His intention in [seeking] physical health should be to prepare for the soul healthy and sound vessels to acquire wisdom and intellectual and emotional advantages until he reaches the goal of [knowing God].</i> and that he have children who will do his work and toil for him. Rather, he should have the intent that his body be whole and strong, in order for his inner soul to be upright so that [it will be able] to know God<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam also elaborates on the interrelation between the attainment of physical health and spiritual achievement in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 27.</p>
<p>Heath is necessary as part of one's process of striving to know God...</i>. For it is impossible to understand and become knowledgeable in the wisdoms when one is starving or sick, or when one of his limbs pains him. [Similarly,] one should intend to have a son [with the hope that] perhaps he will be a wise and great man in Israel.<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the desired goal in procreation - to perpetuate the nation, not only physically, but also spiritually.</p>
<p>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam associates such behavior with Deuteronomy 6:5: ""Love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might."" The course of action described enables us to dedicate every aspect of our being toward the love of God as prescribed by this verse.</p>
<p>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He. - Perhaps, the Rambam uses this name for God to convey the concept that just as God's presence pervades all existence, our service of Him must encompass all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>On this matter, our Sages - <i>Avot</i> 2:15</i>hus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God.<br>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He.<br>On this matter, our Sages have directed and said: ""And all your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven."" This is what Solomon declared in his wisdom: ""Know Him in all your ways<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> 17:7 also associates the above statement with this Biblical quote. <i>Berachot</i> 63b describes this verse as: ""A small passage upon which all the fundamentals of Torah depend."" Note also the Rambam's comments in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, <i>ibid.</i></p>
<p><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. III, notes that the rules of Torah scholarship would have called for the quotation of the Biblical verse before the quote from our Sages. However, the Rambam chooses this sequence because it reflects a progression in the service of God.</p>
<p>""All of your deeds should be for the Sake of Heaven"" implies that the deeds are not themselves holy, merely that they are directed toward a Godly intent. ""Know Him in all your ways"" implies that a bond with God can be established within the context of our physical activity itself.</i> and He will straighten your paths"" (Proverbs 3:6 ."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.1","It is a positive commandment from the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 170) and <i>Sefer Hachinuch</i> (Mitzvah 405) count this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to hear the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah, as [Numbers 29:1] states: ""It shall be a day of sounding [the ram's horn] for you<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the ram's horn is not explicitly mentioned in the verse, our Sages derived the requirement as the Rambam explains.</i>.""<br>The shofar, which is sounded both on Rosh HaShanah and for the <i>yovel</i>, is a bent<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">Rams' horns are always bent. This, too, has homiletic significance, referring to the bending over of our proud hearts. (See <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26b.)</i> ram's horn. All shofarot other than that of a ram are unacceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's opinion is based on the statement of Rav Levi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b), who declares: ""The mitzvah of Rosh Hashanah is to be performed with bent [shofarot],"" implying the use of a sheep's or ram's horn for that is their natural shape.</p>
<p>The Ra'avad, Rabbenu Asher, and many other Rishonim maintain that Rav Levi desired to designate the type of shofar which is most preferable to use, but did not intend to disqualify the horns of other animals. Their view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:1), which states that it is desirable to use the horn of a ram. However, if that is not possible, the horn of any animal may be used. The only exceptions are the horns of a cow and some wild animals whose horns are single, solid entities (Ramban).</i>.<br>Even though the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah [it was derived by our Sages in the following manner]. Concerning the <i>yovel</i>, [Leviticus 25:9] states: ""You shall make a proclamation, sounding the shofar... you shall proclaim with the shofar."" The oral tradition e<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b</i>xplains that just as the ""sounding"" required by the Torah in the <i>yovel</i> requires a shofar, so, too, the ""sounding"" on Rosh HaShanah requires a shofar."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.2","In the Temple<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As will be explained in the commentary to Chapter 2, Halachah 8, and Chapter 7, Halachah 13, in certain contexts the Rambam interprets the expression במקדש - literally, ""in the holy place"" - as referring to the entire city of Jerusalem. (See also the Rambam's commentary to the mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 4:1.) However, in the present context, it refers to the Temple alone. Thus, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 27a states that the shofar was sounded in this manner only ""on the Temple Mount and at the eastern gate.""</i>, on Rosh HaShanah, they would blow [the shofar in the following manner]: There was one shofar and two trumpets, [one on either] side. The sounding of the shofar was extended<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for greater emphasis</i>, while that of the trumpets was shortened, because the mitzvah of the day is performed with the shofar.<br>Why were the trumpets sounded together with it? Because [Psalms 98:6] states: ""You shall sound trumpets and the voice of the shofar before God, the King<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a states that the expression ""before God"" implies: in the Temple.</i>."" However, in other places on Rosh Hashanah, only the shofar is blown."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3","At the outset, we should not blow a shofar of idol worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>, Chapter 4.)</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For it is not appropriate to use such a shofar for a mitzvah.</i>. However, if one sounded it, one has fulfilled his obligation. [In contrast,] should one sound a shofar belonging to an apostate city, one has not fulfilled one's obligation.<br>Concerning a stolen shofar: one who blows it fulfills his obligation, b<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though in general, a mitzvah performed with a stolen article is not acceptable (see Chapter 8, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:7), this case is an exception...</i>ecause the mitzvah is only to listen to the sound, even though the listener does not touch [the shofar]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Based on this statement, the commentaries propose that, according to the Rambam, a person who blows a shofar without putting his lips to it fulfills his obligation. The Ramban (see <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> 1:6) does not accept this view.</i> or lift it up. The laws of theft do not apply to sound alone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for sound is not a physical entity that can be possessed. Rabbenu Manoach and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite other examples from <i>Nedarim</i> 13b-15a, where the Sages differentiate between sound and material entities.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1) derives this law as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone agrees that a stolen lulav is unacceptable. What is the difference between a shofar and a lulav?</p>
<p>Rabbi Yosse responded: ""Concerning a lulav, [Leviticus 23:40] states: 'You shall take for yourself,' implying that only 'your own' is acceptable. In contrast, [Numbers 29:1] states: 'It shall be a day of blowing for you,' implying that regardless [of the nature of the shofar used, the blowing shall be 'for you']"".</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer explained: ""There, [concerning the lulav,] one must perform the mitzvah with the lulav itself. Here, [concerning the shofar,] one performs the mitzvah with its sound.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, because a sin is associated with this mitzvah, Ashkenazic custom is that no blessing should be recited before blowing such a shofar (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 586:4).</i>.<br>Similarly, a shofar from an <i>olah</i> offering should not be sounded, b<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) states: ""the mitzvot were not given to the Jewish people for their enjoyment, but rather as a yoke.""</p>
<p>This concept has relevance in the ethical, as well as the halachic sphere. In the tenth chapter of <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One who serves [God] out of love occupies himself with the Torah and the mitzvot...for no ulterior motive, not because of fear that evil will occur, nor in order to acquire benefit...</p>
<p>The great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: ""Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a gift. Rather, since he is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him""; i.e., serve [Him] out of love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is not intended to imply that a person should not feel happy and fulfilled in the service of God. Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service. We should be totally committed to fulfilling God's will, and the expression of that commitment should generate satisfaction and joy.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 5:16, the Rambam writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Concerning the sound, sight, and smell of consecrated objects: We should not derive benefit from them. However, all the implications of the prohibition against using them for mundane purposes do not apply.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Once an animal is consecrated as an <i>olah</i> offering, no part of its body may be used any other purpose. Therefore, we should not use such a shofar from such an animal for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>This halachah applies before the blood from the sacrifice has been offered on the altar. Afterwards, the skin and horns of the animal become the property of the priests and may be used for mundane purposes (Rashi, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a).</i>ut if one sounds it, he fulfills his obligation, because the laws of מעילה do not apply with regard to sound alone. If you ask: ""Behold, he has derived benefit from hearing [the shofar's] sound?"" - mitzvot were not given for our benefit.<br>Based on this concept, a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the <i>teki'ot</i> required to fulfill the mitzvah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.4","Regarding a shofar to be used on Rosh HaShanah: It is forbidden to violate the festival laws to obtain it. This applies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> not only when obtaining the shofar requires the violation of a <i>melachah</i> (forbidden labor) prohibited by the Torah, but</i> even when the forbidden practice is in the category of <i>sh'vut</i>.<br>How is the above exemplified?

<p>Even after the destruction of the Temple, when it was no longer possible to practice ritual purity, this mitzvah was continued in the hope that the Temple will soon be rebuilt, and the priests will resume continue their previous obligations (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 158:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 158:1).</i> and after partaking of it.This applies even when the bread one eats is not sacred food<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>terumah</i> or sacrificial offerings.</i>.<br>Although a person's hands are not dirty, nor is he aware that they have contracted any type of ritual impurity<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Tohorot</i> 7:8), where the Rambam explains that ""'hands are busy' - i.e., frequently touching [objects] - and it is possible that one touched an impure substance without realizing it.""

Blessings 6.2,"Whenever a person washes his hands - whether before eating<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam requires that a blessing be recited in both the instances mentioned in the previous halachah.

<p>The Radbaz (Vol. IV, Responsum 1365) states that although the Rambam requires that we wash before the afternoon and evening services, a blessing should be recited only when washing before the morning service. This opinion is reinforced by the fact that, when counting the hundred blessings recited each day (<i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 7:14), the Rambam enumerates only one blessing for washing for prayer.</i> - he should recite the following blessing beforehand: ""[Blessed are You...] who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the washing of hands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The word ""washing"" is not a precise translation of the Hebrew נטילת. Rabbenu Asher (<i>Berachot</i>, Chapter 9) explains that this term was used because in Talmudic times, the utensil with which it was customary to wash one's hands was called נטלא. The Sages phrased the blessing in this manner to emphasize that the mere rinsing of one's hands is insufficient and one must use such a utensil.</i>.""<br>This is a Rabbinic mitzvah that we have been commanded by the Torah to follow<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Chapter 11, Halachah 3, the Rambam interprets the blessing recited over Rabbinic commandments as follows: ""who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to follow the instructions of the Sages who commanded us concerning....""</i>, as [Deuteronomy 17:11] states: ""[Do not stray...] from all the laws that they direct you."" A blessing should not, however, be recited before washing after eating<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although the Ra'avad protests strongly the Rambam's ruling, it is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 181:7). (The difference between the Ra'avad and the Rambam revolves around the rationale for this washing. See Note 3 below.)</i>, for this was instituted only as a protective measure. This rationale, however, obligates a person to be more careful in the observance of this practice."
Blessings 6.4,"To what point should one's hands be washed? To the wrist<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although Rabbenu Asher maintains that it is only necessary to wash to the point of connection between the fingers and the hand, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 161:4) accepts the Rambam's decision. Nevertheless, when a person has only a limited supply of water, he may rely on Rabbenu Asher's opinion (Shulchan Aruch HaRav 161:8; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 161:22).</i>. How much water should be used? A [minimum of a] <i>revi'it</i> f<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> one fourth of a larger measure known as a <i>log</i>.

<p>A <i>revi'it</i> is significant in this context because immersion in a <i>revi'it</i> of water is enough to restore ritual purity to a utensil according to Torah law. The Rabbis, however, obligated the use of a <i>mikveh</i> of 40 <i>se'ah</i> for all ritual immersions.</i>or each pair of hands.<br>Anything that is considered an intervening substance [and thus invalidates] a ritual immersion<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 1:12, the Rambam provides this general rule:</p>

Any substance that covers the major portion of one's flesh nullifies the immersion, even though it does not disturb one.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2 of those halachot, the Rambam mentions a long list of particular substances that nullify immersions, including filth, mud, and dough.</i> is also considered an intervening substance with regard to washing hands.

<p>The purpose for which a covering of a jug and a wine pouch are made is related to the containing of liquids. Accordingly, although without modification they cannot serve that purpose in a manner acceptable for use in washing hands, once they are modified they are acceptable.

Similarly, if [tzitzit] were made from both white strands and <i>techelet</i>, and afterwards, the white strands snapped and were reduced until [they did not extend beyond] the corner [of the garment], a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The explanation of the Rambam's statements has been debated by the commentaries. Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Menachot</i> 4:1.</i>nd thus only the <i>techelet</i> remained, it is acceptable."
Fringes 1.5,"Although the [absence of] one does not prevent [the mitzvah from being fulfilled with] the other, they are not considered as two mitzvot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In General Principle 11 of <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">One might think that since neither is dependent on the other, they would be counted as two mitzvot.... [Nevertheless,] they are a single mitzvah... because they have a single objective, ""that you remember all the mitzvot...."" All the elements that bring about this remembrance are counted as a single mitzvah.</i>. Instead, they are a single mitzvah. Whether [the tzitzit] a person wears on his garment are white, <i>techelet</i>, or a combination of the two colors, he fulfills a single mitzvah.<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i>he Sages of the early generations related: [Numbers 15:39 states:] ""And they shall be tzitzit for you."" This<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the use of the singular form of the verb והיה</i> teaches that they are both one mitzvah.<br>The [presence of each of the] four tzitzit is necessary [for the mitzvah to be fulfilled]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., although a garment has several tzitzit, the mitzvah is not fulfilled unless it has all four.</i>, because all four are [elements] of a single mitzvah."
Fringes 1.6,"How are the tzitzit made? One begins from the corner of a garment - i.e., the end of its woven portion<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The tzitzit must be placed at the ""corners"" or the ""fringes"" of the garment.</i>. One ascends upward no more than three fingerbreadths from the edge, but no less than the distance from the knuckle of the thumb to its end<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is approximately two fingerbreadths. Any lower would be considered as ""below the fringe"" and not ""on the fringe"" (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:16).</p>
<p>Other opinions mention that these distances should also be applied in regard to the space between the hole and the side of the garment. It is customary to follow this view (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:10).</i>.<br>[A hole is made] and four strands inserted, [causing them] to be folded in half. Thus, there will be eight strands hanging down from the corner. These eight strands must be at least four fingerbreadths long<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This decision is based on the Rambam's interpretation of<i>Menachot</i> 39a and 41b. Based on the same sources, Rabbenu Tam requires that the strands be at least twelve fingerbreadths long. His opinion is accepted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:4) and the later authorities.</i>. If they are longer - even if they are a cubit or two long - it is acceptable. The term ""fingerbreadth"" refers to a thumbbreadth<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> 9:9. In contemporary measure, a thumbbreadth is approximately 2 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 2.4 centimeters according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i>.<br>One of the eight strands should be <i>techelet</i>; the other seven should be white."

<p>As explained in <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 1:11, any time when an activity must be carried out <i>lishmah</i>, it cannot be performed by a gentile. Therefore, the strands may not be spun by a gentile alone (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:1).</i>zitzit] may not be made from wool which becomes attached to thorns when sheep graze among them, nor from hairs which are pulled off the animal, and not from the leftover strands of the woof which the weaver leaves over when he completes a garment.

Fringes 1.12,"Tzitzit that were made<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., attached to the garment and tied</i> by a gentile are not acceptable, as [implied by Numbers 15:38, which] states: ""Speak to the children of Israel... and you shall make tzitzit for yourselves."" If, however, a Jew made tzitzit without the intention [that they be used for the mitzvah], they are acceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This principle can be derived from the above concept. Were it necessary for the tzitzit to be tied with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah, there would be no need for a special verse from the Torah to teach that those made by a gentile are unacceptable. The concept would be self-explanatory. Whenever a deed must be performed with a specific intention, a gentile's acts are not acceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</p>
<p>The Ashkenazic authorities do not accept this premise and maintain that, at the very least, the strands must be attached to the garment with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:2.)</i>.<br>Tzitzit that are made from those already existing are not acceptable."
Reading the Shema 1.1,"We [are obligated to] recite the <i>Shema</i> twice daily - in the evening and in the morning - as [Deuteronomy 6:7] states: ""...when you lie down and when you rise"" - i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 10), the Rambam mentions the beginning of this verse, ודברת בם... (And you shall speak of them...) as the source for the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his statements in this halachah do not necessarily represent a change of mind. Here, the Rambam is not interested in the actual source for the mitzvah itself (which is the case in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>), but in stating our obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> twice daily, once at night and once in the daytime. This is derived from the end of the verse, as mentioned by the Rambam.</i>.e., when people are accustomed to sleep - this being the night - and when people are accustomed to rise, this being daytime."
Reading the Shema 1.2,"And what is it that one recites?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are various opinions as to what constitutes the positive commandment of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 419) states clearly that the Torah obligates us to read only the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> - i.e., <i>Shema Yisrael</i>. The reading of the rest of the three sections was instituted by the Sages.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Yonah understands that the whole first section constitutes the Torah obligation. (See <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 63 at the end.) There is also an opinion that the obligation to recite the first two sections originates in the Torah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 58.) However, in practice, everyone ultimately agrees that one must recite all three sections mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah (<i>Berachot</i> 13a).</i> These three sections:
<p class=""rambam_indented"">""Hear O Israel..."" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9),<br/>
""And if you will listen..."" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21),and<br/>
""And God said..."" (Numbers 15:37-41).<br>We begin with the section of ""Hear O Israel"" since it contains [the concept of] the unity of God<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The statement ""God is our Lord, God is one"" implies not only that there is only one God, but all creation is one with Him. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:6.</i>, [the commandment of] loving Him and the study of Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> ""... and you shall teach your children and speak of them"" (Deuteronomy 6:7 .</p>
<p>It must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, the Rambam quotes Deuteronomy 11:19 (a verse in the second section of the <i>Shema</i>), as the source for the mitzvah of Torah study.</i>, it being a fundamental principle upon which everything is based.<br>After it, [we read] ""And if you will listen...,"" since it contains the imperative to fulfill the rest of the commandments, and finally the portion of <i>tzitzit</i>, since it also contains the imperative of remembering all the commandments."
Reading the Shema 1.3,"The commandment of <i>tzitzit</i> is not obligatory at night. N<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Berachot</i> 12b.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam does not count the mentioning of the exodus from Egypt as one of the 613 commandments in the Torah, nor does he mention it elsewhere in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</p>
<p>The Rambam does, however, count the commandment of the telling of the story of the exodus on the fifteenth of <i>Nisan</i> - i.e., Passover night - as one of the mitzvot. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 21), and <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i>, Chapters 7 and 8.</p>
<p>According to some opinions, one can differentiate between the two obligations as follows: A person can fulfill his daily obligation with simply a thought about the exodus, whereas on <i>Pesach</i> night the mitzvah can be performed only through the verbal description of the redemption from Egypt. (See <i>Sha'agat Aryeh</i>, 13.)</p>
<p>This would explain the omission of this commandment from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. A commandment that can be fulfilled with a thought alone and not an explicit statement or action is not ""worthy"" of inclusion in the list of 613 commandments of the Torah. (See the Rambam's explanation of the commandment to remember Amalek: Positive Commandment 189).</p>
<p>The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, however, disagrees with this opinion. In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 67, he states that even the daily obligation requires an explicit statement. Nevertheless, he explains that it was not chosen as one of the 613 commandments because the obligation to remember the exodus twice daily is not stated in the form of a command in the Torah to ""Remember,"" but rather, as a reason for another mitzvah (the mitzvah of <i>matzah</i>): ""In order that you shall remember..."" (Deuteronomy 16:3 .</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Numbers 15:39 states: ""And you shall see them..."" - implying that <i>tzitzit</i> must only be worn when they can be seen, i.e., daytime. Accordingly, there is no obligation to wear <i>tzitzit</i> at night. See <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:7-8.</i>evertheless, we recite [the section describing] it at night because it contains mention of the exodus from Egypt.<br>We are commanded to mention the exodus both during the day and at night as [Deuteronomy 16:3] states: ""In order that you shall remember the day of your leaving the land of Egypt all the days of your life.""<br>Reading these three sections in this order constitutes the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>."
Reading the Shema 1.4,"When reciting the <i>Shema</i>, after completing the first verse, one says quietly ""Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom forever."" H<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This phrase is recited quietly because it is not part of the section of the <i>Shema</i> as it appears in the Torah, but rather was recited by Jacob in Egypt, as explained later in this halachah.</p>
<p>It is, however, pronounced loudly on Yom Kippur. <i>Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer</i> explains that the angels praise God with this verse. On Yom Kippur, we are as pure as angels and thus, emulate their practice (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).</p>
<p>It is preferable to separate clearly between the end of ""Blessed be the name"" - i.e., the words לעולם ועד - forever, and the beginning of the next section, ואהבת (And you shall love...) (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 61).</i>e then continues to read the first section in its normal fashion: ""And you shall love God, your Lord...""<br>Why do we read it in this fashion? It is our tradition that when the patriarch, Jacob, gathered all his sons together in Egypt close to his death<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Genesis, Chapter 49.</i>, he commanded and urged them regarding the Unity of God and the path of God upon which Abraham and Isaac, his father, had tread.<br>He asked them: ""My sons, perhaps there are dregs among you, one who does not stand with me in the Unity of God?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> What would cause Jacob to have such a doubt regarding his children? One of the greatest merits of Jacob is that he - unlike Avraham, who fathered Yishmael, and Yitzchak, who had Esau as a son - had only righteous children.</p>
<p><i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains that Jacob desired to reveal the secret of the end of days to his children, but that this knowledge suddenly left him. He was worried that perhaps his sudden lack of understanding was due to the imperfect state of his children and therefore, felt compelled to ask them about their faith in the One God.</p>
<p>The Rambam omits all these particulars, since they are not relevant to the matter at hand - namely, the source of the custom of saying ""Blessed be the name..."" after ""<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...""</i>"" This is comparable to the manner in which Moses, our teacher, said to us: ""Lest there be among you a man or woman [whose heart turns this day from God...]"" (Deuteronomy 29:17 .<br>They all answered and said: ""Listen, Israel<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Jacob is also called by that name (Genesis 32:29 .</i>, God is our Lord, God is One,"" i.e., listen to us, Israel, our father, God is our Lord, God is One.<br>The wise elder responded:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Praising God for the fortune of having righteous children;</i> ""Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever."" Therefore, the Jews are accustomed to utter the praise that Israel, the wise elder, uttered after this verse."
Reading the Shema 1.6,"The first blessing preceding [the <i>Shema</i>] in the day [begins: ""Blessed are You, God...], the One who forms the light and creates darkness,...""

<p>In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> (1:5-6), the Rambam writes that a person who mentions the central ideas contained in the <i>p'tichah</i> - i.e., the name of God and His sovereignty - even were he to deviate from the set form of the blessing, would fulfill his obligation.</p>
<p>We must understand the present halachah in this context. Only when one deviates from the <i>p'tichah</i> or <i>chatimah</i> of a blessing does the Rambam require the recitation of another blessing. However, a person who maintains the nature of the <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i>, but changes the wording of the rest of the blessing, fulfills his obligation as long as the basic intent of the blessing remains.</i>.<br>Anyone who does not say [the paragraph of] ""True and certain..."" in the morning prayer or [the paragraph of] ""True and faithful..."" in the evening prayer does not fulfill his obligation."

<p>Even in such an instance, the second blessing should be recited without a <i>p'tichah</i>, since it usually follows another blessing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

Reading the Shema 1.9,"When is the [proper] time for the recitation of Shema at night? The commandment [starts] from the time of the appearance of the stars<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) states that the time for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> begins at the hour when a priest who has become ritually impure may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and resume eating <i>terumah</i>. The Talmud explains that this is the time when the stars appear.</p>
<p><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) holds that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited earlier, during the last hour before sunset. This is based on the understanding that Rabbi Yehudah, who disagrees with the majority opinion regarding the proper time for the afternoon prayer, also disagrees about the proper time for the evening prayer and <i>Kri'at Shema</i> contained therein. (See <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 235.) This will be discussed at length in <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 3:6.</p>
<p>There are several different positions regarding the precise definition of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). It generally refers to the appearance of three medium-sized stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 235:1 requires the sighting of three small stars before reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of צאת הכוכבים, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night.</p>
<p>There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.</p>
<p>The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines צאת הכוכבים as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.</p>
<p>There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary to the mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 3:2, maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars is 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that צאת הכוכבים is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.</p>
<p>According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other.</i>...<br>A person who transgresses and delays fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam defines dawn (עלות השחר) as the light that radiates from the east before sunrise.</p>
<p>There are three major positions regarding this time. All are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 94a which defines the time from dawn until sunrise as that in which a person can walk either 4 <i>mil</i> (according to one opinion) or 5 <i>mil</i> (according to the other).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two opinions regarding the measure of time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>: 18 minutes or 24 minutes. Thus, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi defines dawn as 120 (5 x 24) minutes before sunrise. The most widely held view is that it is 90 (5 x 18) minutes before sunrise, while the <i>Beit Yosef</i> holds that dawn is 72 (4 x 18) minutes before sunrise. This is the opinion of the Rambam, as stated in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)</i>. [The Sages established the limit] of midnight only in order to distance us from negligent wrongdoing."
Reading the Shema 1.10,"One who reads the <i>Shema</i> [of the night] after dawn, [but] before sunrise<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the last possible time that could be defined as night</i>, does not fulfill his obligation unless he was unavoidably detained - e.g., drunk or sick, or in a similar situation. A person who was so detained and reads [the <i>Shema</i>] at this time does not recite [the blessing of] ""Lay us down."""
Reading the Shema 1.11,"When is the proper time [for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>] during the day? The commandment is that one should start to read before sunrise i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah, (<i>Berachot</i> 9b) records a disagreement regarding the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning.</p>
<p>An anonymous position sees the earliest possible time as when one can distinguish between <i>techelet</i> (blue-green) and white. Rabbi Eliezer says: Between green and blue-green - i.e., later - and that the time lasts until sunrise. Rabbi Yehoshua says that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> ""until three hours.""</p>
<p>The Talmud then adds various other opinions and quotes Abaye as saying that the <i>Shema</i> should be recited כותיקין - i.e., one should finish reciting the <i>Shema</i> as the sun rises, in order to start the silent <i>Amidah</i> with the sunrise.</p>
<p>The Rambam clearly prefers this position and establishes 6 minutes as a reasonable amount of time to recite the <i>Shema</i> and the blessing after it, in order to start the <i>Amidah</i> at the proper time. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 58:1) explains that all opinions agree that the commandment to recite <i>Shema</i> in the morning begins at dawn. The only disagreement revolves around the optimum time to recite <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Vilna Gaon differs and explains that the Rambam holds that Abaye's position states the actual time of the beginning of the commandment itself and that it may be recited earlier only in extraordinary circumstances.</i>n order to conclude and recite the last blessing with the sunrise. This measure [of time] is one-tenth of an hour before the sun rises<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is based on the verse in Psalms 72:5, ""May they fear You with the sun"" - i.e., may they show their fear for You with the Amidah as the sun rises (<i>Berachot</i> 9b). The Talmud promises that anyone who recites the <i>Shema</i> and the Amidah at this time is guaranteed a place in the World to Come.</i>.<br>A person who delays and reads the <i>Shema</i> after the sun rises fulfills his obligation, for the proper time is until the end of the third hour of the day for one who transgresses and delays."

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 8.1","There are two forms for a passage<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Torah is divided into 669 passages, each containing one or more verses. There are two structures with which they are written: <i>p'tuchah</i> (described in this halachah) and <i>s'tumah</i> (described in the following halachah).</i> which is written as <i>p'tuchah</i>: [One form is used] when one completes [the previous passage] in the midst of the line<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained below, leaving an empty space large enough to contain nine letters.</i>.

If, however, the empty space is very small or one concludes [the previous passage] at the end of the line, one should leave one line totally empty and begin the passage that is <i>p'tuchah</i> at the beginning of the third line."

However, even according to the Rambam, the obligation to destroy the chametz before the Sabbath is not a hard and fast rule.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.8,"Thus, a person who does not nullify [his chametz] before the sixth hour<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad questions the phraseology used by the Rambam, noting that the prohibitions against owning chametz do not begin until the evening. On the day of the fourteenth of Nisan, there is only a positive commandment to destroy chametz.</p>
<p>Most commentaries explain that the Rambam himself intended this interpretation. However, some note that Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 4b) does maintain that the prohibitions against owning chametz begin on the fourteenth, and they maintain that the Rambam shares this view (See Responsa, <i>Nodah BiYhudah, Orach Chayim</i> 20).</i> and discovers chametz which he:
<blockquote>
considered important and [valued] in his heart,<br>t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 6b) states that the prohibitions only apply when the chametz has an intrinsic value, in contrast to crumbs.</i>hen forgot at the time of the destruction of chametz,<br>and hence did not destroy,

<p>Similarly, with regard to chametz, since one is forbidden to benefit from it, it is no longer considered in one's possession and cannot be sold, bartered, or given away. Nevertheless, the person retaining it is still liable for transgression of the prohibitions involved.</i>herefore,] he is obligated to destroy it whenever he finds it. If he finds it on the day of a festival, he should cover it with a utensil until the evening, and then destroy it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This statement raises questions among many of the commentators. In Halachah 3, the Rambam also mentions covering chametz with a utensil. However, in that instance, the person had already nullified his possession of the chametz, and thus his possession of chametz violated only a Rabbinic prohibition.</p>
<p>In contrast, this instance describes chametz that has not been nullified, and thus the violation of a Torah prohibition is involved. Nevertheless, the Rambam considers the Rabbinic prohibition against <i>mukzteh</i> as important enough to override the fulfillment of a Torah commandment. Furthermore, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since the person himself desires to destroy the chametz, and the only reason he fails to do so is the Rabbinic commandment, he is not considered to have violated the Torah's prohibitions against possessing chametz.</p>
<p>This view is not accepted by all authorities. Many explain that since three Torah mitzvot (the two prohibitions against possessing chametz and the positive commandment to destroy chametz) are involved, their observance overrides the prohibitions of <i>muktzeh</i>. Others maintain that even if the prohibition against <i>muktzeh</i> must be observed, the chametz can be destroyed by burning it in the place where it is located.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in practice, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 446:2), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> do not accept the latter view, and advise waiting to destroy the chametz until after the holiday. They explain that a person is allowed to light a fire on a festival only if doing so increases his festive joy. Hence, they prohibit burning the chametz in that manner. However, they mention that, if it is possible, a gentile may be asked to destroy the chametz. Furthermore, in the diaspora, a Jew is also allowed to destroy chametz he finds on the second day of a festival.</i>. [If the chametz] was consecrated property, there is no need to cover it with a utensil, for regardless, everyone shies away from its use."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.9,"A person who left his house before the time for destroying chametz in order to fulfill a mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 49a) mentions a person who goes out to slaughter the Paschal sacrifice or circumcise his son.

However, the Sages showed leniency, since the nullification of chametz is sufficient according to Torah law. They did not require a person to return to destroy chametz unless a quantity the size of an egg, the measure associated with ritual purity and impurity, was found.</i>. If there is less than the size of an egg, it is sufficient for him to nullify it in his heart."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.10,"A person who put aside a rolled dough<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a dough that was kneaded, but which had not yet risen.</i> at home, [forgot about it,] went out and remembered after he had left [home]: Should he be sitting before his teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and thus leaving would be a sign of disrespect to his teacher.</p>
<p>This example is given by the Talmud. Nevertheless, when quoting this halachah, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 444:8) states: ""Were he busy with other matters,"" implying that the law applies even when one's intent is not necessarily associated with a mitzvah.</i> and fear that the dough will become leavened before he can come [home], behold, he may nullify [ownership over the dough] in his heart before it becomes leaven<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the dough has not become leaven, its possession is still permitted. Hence, a person is still entitled to nullify his ownership of it.</p>
<p>Once he has nullified his ownership of the dough, its presence in his house does not constitute a violation of the prohibitions against the possession of chametz, because it no longer belongs to him.</p>
<p>At present, people very infrequently bake matzah on Pesach itself in Ashkenazic communities. However, it is customary to do so in certain Sephardic communities. When preparing the dough, the women always nullify their ownership of any small pieces of dough that become stuck to the kneading pin or bowl before they become leavened, so that they will not possess even the slightest amount of chametz. (See <i>Hagahot Maimoni</i>.)</i>.<br>However, if [the dough] has already become leavened, his nullification is not at all effective, for he has already violated [the prohibitions]: ""[leaven] shall not be seen"" and ""[leaven] shall not be found.""

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.11,"How must chametz be destroyed?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Halachah 2:2 explains that the mitzvah ""to destroy chametz"" is fulfilled by nullifying one's ownership of it. This halachah refers to the Rabbinic prohibition to destroy all known chametz; alternatively, to the destruction of chametz discovered after the beginning of the sixth hour.</i> It may be burned; crumbled and tossed to the wind; or thrown into the sea. If the chametz is hard and the sea will not cause it to dissolve speedily, one should crumble it and then throw it into the sea<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 2:1), the Rambam writes that dried bread should be crumbled ""a lot"" before being thrown to the sea. <i>Pesachim</i> 28a records a debate among the Sages whether it is necessary to crumble all chametz before throwing it to the sea. There is extensive debate among the commentators regarding the Rambam's interpretation of this passage. Most halachic authorities (<i>Taz, Orach Chayim</i> 445:1) require chametz to be crumbled even before it is tossed into the sea.</i>.<br>If other substances fell upon chametz and it was covered by three handbreadths or more of earth, it is considered as having been destroyed. [Nevertheless,] one must nullify [ownership over] it in one's heart if the sixth hour has not arrived<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, even if the chametz is uncovered during Pesach, it will no longer be within one's possession (Rashi, <i>Pesachim</i> ibid.).</i>.<br>A person who gave it to a gentile before the sixth hour need not destroy it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 5b notes that Exodus 13:7, the verse prohibiting the possession of chametz, states: ""No chametz will be seen for you."" The addition of the latter phrase implies that there is no prohibition against chametz that belongs to a gentile being found in one's domain during Pesach. The following chapter discusses this subject in depth.</i>.<br>If one burns it before the sixth hour, he is permitted to benefit from the charcoal that remains during Pesach. However, if he burns it from [the beginning of] the sixth hour and onward, since benefit may not be derived from it, it should not be used as fuel<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> while it is being burned.</i> for an oven or range. One may not bake or cook with it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even after it becomes charcoal.</i>.<br>If one did bake or cook [using the chametz as fuel], it is forbidden to derive benefit from that loaf or that dish. Similarly, it is forbidden to derive benefit from the charcoal that remains from it, because it was burned after benefit from it became forbidden."
Sabbath 1.1,"Resting from labor o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">Within the context of the Sabbath laws, labor does not refer to strenuous work, but rather to the performance of one of the thirty nine labors that were necessary for the construction of the Temple or a labor which is analogous to them. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 1.)</p>
<p>The Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah is significant. Our Rabbis have offered two definitions of the mitzvah of resting on the Sabbath: In his commentary on <i>Yevamot</i> 6a, the Rashba states that the mitzvah is negative in nature: one refrains from performing prohibited labors. In contrast, in his commentary on Leviticus 23:24, the Ramban explains that the mitzvah possesses a positive dimension: to spend the day in a restful frame of mind, abstaining from all activities - even those that are not forbidden labors - which would disrupt this tranquility.</p>
<p>From the Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah, it would appear that he follows the first view. From his statements in Chapter 21, Halachah 1, however, it would appear that he accepts the second perspective. (See also <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>.)</i>n the seventh day fulfills a positive commandment, as [Exodus 23:12] states, ""And you shall rest on the seventh day."" A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 9), the Rambam mentions that the commandment to rest on the Sabbath is mentioned 12 times in the Torah. <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> and others question why the Rambam cites this proof-text in particular.</i>nyone who performs a labor on this day negates the observance of a positive commandment and also transgresses a negative commandment, for [<i>ibid.</i> 20:10] states, ""Do not perform any labor [on it].""<br>W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""><i> Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 320) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch </i>(Mitzvah 32) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i>hat are the liabilities incurred by a person who performs labor [on this day]? If he does so willingly, as a conscious act of defiance, h<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">and not inadvertently.</p>
<p>The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1510) notes that the Rambam uses the expression ""willingly, as a conscious act of defiance"" with regard to the transgressions of idolatry (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 3:1), the Sabbath laws, and the laws of Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 1:1). With regard to all other transgressions punishable by <hebrew>כרת</hebrew>, the Rambam merely states ""as a conscious act of defiance.""</p>
<p>The Radbaz explains that it is possible that the Rambam mentioned the concept of ""willingly"" with regard to these three transgressions because they are the first cases of <hebrew>כרת</hebrew> mentioned in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. After mentioning the concept on these three occasions, he does not think further repetition is necessary.</i>e is liable for <i>karet</i>; if witnesses who administer a warning are present, h<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">As explained in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 12:1-2, punishment is not administered for the violation of a transgression unless the transgressor is made aware of the punishment he could receive for his deed.</i>e should be stoned [to death].

Torah Study 5.2,"What is meant by disputing the authority of one's teacher?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on the previous halachah, Halachah 9 states:</p>
<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">When does the above apply? To one's outstanding teacher (<i>rabo hamuzhak</i> ), from whom one has gained the majority of one's wisdom. However, a person who has not gained the majority of his wisdom under a teacher's instruction is considered to be both a student and colleague. He is not obligated to honor him in all the above matters.</i> A person who establishes a house of study [where] he sits, explains, and teaches<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and renders halachic decisions. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 242:7 (see also <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>) explains that the prohibition applies only to rendering halachic decisions on matters directly related to practice. There is no difficulty involved in teaching on a merely theoretical level. However, it is not clear whether the Rambam would accept this view.</p>
<p>The <i>Rishon Letzion</i> explains that this prohibition applies even to establishing a house of study under one's own direction, even though one does not render any halachic decisions.</i> without his teacher's permission in his teacher's lifetime<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is a mark of disrespect to one's teacher to set oneself up to be an equivalent authority.</p>
<p><i>Eruvin</i> 62b relates that as long as Rav Huna was alive, Rav Chisda, his disciple, would not render any decisions, even those concerning as obvious a matter as dipping ""an egg in a mixture of sour milk and bread.""</p>

[This applies] even when one's teacher is in another country.<br>It is forbidden to ever render a halachic judgment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> except in the instances mentioned in the following halachah.

Torah Study 5.4,"Any student who is not worthy of rendering halachic judgments and does so is foolish, wicked, and arrogant<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Avot</i> 4:9, which uses these adjectives to describe a person who ""renders halachic judgments casually.""

<p>[A teacher once told a student to serve as the Rabbi of a particular community. The student protested, claiming that he was afraid of the responsibility of rendering halachic judgments for such a large community.</p>

Compare to <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 6:3, which describes the reverence due to a father:</p>

<p>We find an example of this in the Talmud. Abbaye's name was actually Nachmani. However, since his teacher, Rabbah, had a father with that name, he coined a new name for his disciple (<i>Ha'Aruch</i>).</i>.<br>The above applies when the name is unusual, and all will thus know to whom it refers.<br>[A student] should not greet his teacher or respond to the latter's greeting, as is customary when two friends exchange greetings. Rather, he should bow before him and say with awe and reverence: ""Peace be upon you, my master<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Bava Kama</i> 73b states that it is improper for a student to greet a teacher at all, as implied by Job 29:8: ""The lads saw me and hid.""</i>.""

Torah Study 5.6,"Similarly, he should not remove his <i>tefillin</i> in the presence of his teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav David Arameah notes that this law is found in the <i>Shimusha Rabbah</i>.

However, the <i>Shibbolei HaLeket</i> and others render the <i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> as translated here.</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Sanhedrin</i> 101b, which forbids removing one's <i>tefillin</i> in the presence of a king.

<p>From the Rambam's statements, it appears that the additional light is kindled by the master of of the household and not by each of the members of the household themselves. Even according to this interpretation, however, the custom of each child lighting Chanukah lights is valuable as an expression of <i>chinuch</i>, training them in the observance of the mitzvot.</i>, whether male or female.<br>A person who is even more conscientious in his performance of the mitzvah than this and observes the mitzvah in the most desirable manner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) describes such a person as <i>mehadrin min hamehadrin</i>.</i> should light candles for every member of his household, a candle for each individual, whether male or female, on the first night.

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.5,"The Chanukah candles should not be kindled before sunset<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Most commentaries interpret the Rambam's intent as the time when the sun disappears from the horizon.

The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 672:2) states that in the present age, since it is customary to light inside one's house (see Halachah 8 and commentary), the essential element of publicizing the Chanukah miracle is to involve one's own family in the candle lighting. Therefore, one fulfills the mitzvah as long as the members of one's household are awake.</p>
<p>The Ramah, nevertheless, counsels that at the outset, one should try to adhere to the stricter view. In light of these statements, the common practice of lighting the Chanukah candles well after nightfall should be examined.

Should this time pass, one should not kindle the lights.<br>One should place enough oil in the lamp<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When one lights the candles, they should have the amount of oil mentioned.

(See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 675:2.)</i> so that it will continue burning until there are no longer any passersby in the marketplace. If one lit it and it became extinguished, one need not light it a second time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 673:2) prefaces this law by stating the principle, ""kindling fulfills the mitzvah.""

Thus, one must light them in a manner that - barring any unexpected events - they will be able to burn for a half an hour - e.g., they must have a sufficient amount of oil to burn for that period and they must not be placed where they could be extinguished by the wind. Once a person has taken these precautions, however, he has no further obligation.</p>
<p>Note, however, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:27, which states that it is proper to relight the candles so that they will burn for the desired time.</i>.

<p>Although all wicks are acceptable, it is customary to use wicks of flax or of cotton (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:2).</i>. Even on the Sabbath nights of Chanukah, it is permitted to light with oils and wicks that are forbidden to be used for the Sabbath lights<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Needless to say, the prohibition against using these candles for the Sabbath lights still remains in effect.</i>.<br>[The reason for this leniency is that] it is forbidden to use the Chanukah candles [for one's own purposes]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> During the week, this prohibition applies only during the first half hour that the candles are burning.

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.7,"It is a mitzvah to place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As is obvious from Halachah 9, the Chanukah lamp should be placed outside before being lit.</p>
<p>""IR1200<b>the Chanukah lamp at the outside of the entrance to one's home -</b> As mentioned previously, the mitzvah of lighting Chanukah candles was instituted for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle. Therefore, the candles should be placed at the outside of one's dwelling to attract the attention of the passersby in the public domain (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 21b).</p>
<p>In a spiritual sense, this points to the potential possessed by the Chanukah candles to spread light beyond the normal limits of holiness. Generally, mitzvot are performed within a home or synagogue. In this instance, the nature of the mitzvah is to spread light to the public domain, to illuminate the darkness of the world at large.</p>

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.8,"In a time of danger, a person may place a Chanukah lamp inside his house<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 21b mentions this leniency. According to <i>Tosafot</i>, the danger refers to the persecutions of the Jews of Babylon by the ruling Persians for lighting candles mentioned in <i>Shabbat</i> 45a. Needless to say, there have been countless other periods of persecution in Jewish history.</p>
<p>It is, however, significant that even in times when there was no obvious danger, the custom has been to light the Chanukah candles inside our homes. Even in the present day, when there is little danger of persecution in most places where Jews are located, it is not customary to light the Chanukah candles at the entrance to the home in most communities.</i>; even if he lit it on his table, it is sufficient.<br>[Therefore,] another lamp must be burning in the house to provide light for one's [mundane] activities<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Halachah 6, it is forbidden to use the light of the Chanukah lamp for a mundane purpose. Since it is very likely that there will be some activity carried out in the house while the candles are burning, an additional light should be kindled. Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:14, which explains that the present custom is to kindle an additional light near the Chanukah candles, besides the light that is ordinarily burning in the room.</p>
<p>This light, called the <i>shamash</i>, should be placed apart from the Chanukah candles so that it can be distinguished from them (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 673:1). Often, many commercially produced Chanukah lamps fail to make a sufficient distinction between this candle and the Chanukah lights themselves.</i>. If a fire is burning in the house, an additional candle is not necessary. For a prestigious person who does not normally use the light of a fire, an additional candle is required."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.9,"A Chanukah lamp that was kindled by a deaf-mute, a mentally incapable person, a minor, or a gentile is of no consequence<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., it does not constitute fulfillment of the mitzvah. All these four individuals are not obligated to fulfill mitzvot. Therefore, their kindling of the Chanukah lamp cannot fulfill the obligation instituted by our Sages.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Nissim mentions that a minor who is of the age when he is obligated to be trained in the fulfillment of the commandments may kindle the Chanukah lamps on behalf of the household. This opinion is not, however, accepted by other authorities, although they do mention that a child should be trained in the observance of the mitzvah of Chanukah candles as part of his process of education (<i>chinuch</i>).</p>

This principle emphasizes that it is the kindling of the lights which is the focus of the mitzvah.</p>
<p>This is significant, for one might think that since the purpose of the mitzvah is <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, communicating the Chanukah miracles, what is most important is the fact that the lights are burning; how they are lit is of no consequence. This principle shows, however, that for <i>pirsumei nisa</i> to take place, the Chanukah lights must be kindled as prescribed by our Sages (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).</i>,"" would accept this law, because it would appear that one is carrying the lamp as a torch and using it to light the way.</i>.

<p>Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:1, the Rambam mentions that the Sabbath candles contribute to the atmosphere of <i>oneg Shabbat</i>, Sabbath pleasure. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:5, he mentions them as being associated with activities carried out in honor of the Sabbath (<i>k'vod Shabbat</i>). In the laws of the Sabbath itself, the Rambam does not mention the connection between the Sabbath candles and peace within the home.</p>
<p>This relates to the concept mentioned previously, that the peace generated by the Sabbath candles relates to the Torah as a whole and not to the Sabbath in particular (<i>Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.</i>).</i>.<br>[Peace is of primary importance, as reflected by the mitzvah requiring] God's name to be blotted out to create peace between a husband and his wife<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam is referring to the process of testing a <i>sotah</i>, a woman suspected of committing adultery.

<p>The Rambam uses the word ישכים - to rise early. Perhaps he is alluding to <i>Berachot</i> 47b which states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">One should always rise early and go to the synagogue in order to merit being counted among the first ten present. Even if 100 people come after him, he receives the reward of all of them.</p>

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.2,"It is a mitzvah to run to the synagogue as [Hoshea 6:3] states: ""Let us know.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.4,"What is implied by [the term,] communal prayer? One [person] prays aloud and all [the others] listen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With this statement, the Rambam touches on a point debated both by the Sages of the Talmud and the later Rabbis. The mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 33b, states:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Just as the leader of the congregation is obligated [to pray], each individual is obligated. Rabban Gamliel states: ""The leader of the congregation fulfills the obligation on behalf of the community.""</p>
<p>The Talmud (34b) elaborates on the difference of opinion:</p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">They asked Rabban Gamliel: ""According to your opinion, why does the community pray?""<br/>
He replied: ""In order to allow the leader of the community to prepare his prayers.""<br/>
Rabban Gamliel asked them: ""According to your opinion, why does the leader of the congregation pray aloud?""<br/>
They replied: ""In order to allow those who are not knowledgeable to fulfill their obligation.""<br/>
He told them: ""Just as he fulfills the obligation on behalf of those who are not knowledgeable, he fulfills it on behalf of those who are knowledgeable.""</p>
<p>The Sages of the Talmud continued to debate the issue. The ultimate decision accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, the Rambam (See Halachah 9), and Rabbenu Asher, is that during the entire year, the Sages' opinion is accepted. However, on Rosh HaShanah, because of the complexity of the blessings (See Halachah 10), Rabban Gamliel's opinion prevails.</p>
<p>Both Rabban Gamliel and the Sages agree that the practice of communal prayer involves two elements:<br/>
a) the silent prayers of many individuals; and<br/>
b) the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br/>
They differ, however, as to which of these elements is considered of primary importance. According to the Sages, the essential element of communal prayer is that ten or more people recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the same time. According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.</p>
<p>[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]</p>
<p>The Rambam's statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.</p>
<p>In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam's statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan's</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9). By doing so, one will have both the advantages of individual and communal prayer.</i>. This should not be done with fewer than ten adult<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Males who have reached the age of thirteen years and a day and manifested signs of physical maturity. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:19.)</p>
<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this halachah from <i>Berachot</i> 47b-48a which allows for the inclusion of a child in the <i>zimmun</i> for the grace after meals. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:7.) We assume that this leniency was granted only in regard to grace, but not in regard to prayer. See also <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 91:3.</p>
<p>Many Halachic authorities do not accept this conclusion. In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon rules that a child may be counted as the tenth in a <i>minyan</i>. Similarly, the <i>Ba'al HaMe'or</i> holds that even up to four minors may be counted in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted. There are opinions that in such a case, the minor must be at least six years old, understand that prayer is service to God, and hold a <i>chumash</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 55:5, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 55:5).</i> free males. The leader of the congregation is [counted as] one of them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""></p>
<p class=""rambam_indented"">Our Sages in the West say [that <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>barchu</i> may be recited] even with seven. They explain their position [based on Judges 5:2]: ""In the time of tumult in Israel when the people volunteered themselves, blessed be God."" [The number of people correspond] to the number of words [in the verse which describes the blessing of God].<br/>
There are those who say only six [are required], since ברכו is the sixth word [of the above verse].</p>
<p>The Rambam differentiates between the ruling regarding prayer and his statements in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:8 where he writes that it is necessary that seven people out of ten eat bread in order to constitute a <i>minyan</i> for <i>zimmun</i>, for ""a noticeable majority"" is required.</p>
<p>There are two views quoted in the name of Rabbenu Tam (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> 23b); one, requiring a minimum of seven people who have not prayed for a <i>minyan</i> just as seven who have eaten bread are required for a <i>minyan</i> in regard to grace after meals and, another, requiring, only five. However, the Rambam's opinion is universally accepted as halachah.</p>
<p>Similarly, we should not recite Kedushah, - See Chapter 7, Halachah 17.</p>
<p>In the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is customary to recite three verses in the <i>Kedushah</i>:<br/>
a) ""Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the entire earth is full of His glory"" (Isaiah 6:3 ;<br/>
b) ""Blessed be the glory of God from His place"" (Ezekiel 3:12 ;<br/>
c) ""The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, throughout all generations"" (Psalms 146:10 .</p>
<p>Only the first two of these verses are recited in the <i>Kedushah</i> of the blessings before the <i>Shema</i>. However, in the<i>Kedushah</i> recited at the end of the service, a verse similar to Psalms 146:10 is also included.</p>
<p>The commentaries debate the definition of <i>Kedushah</i> and therefore, question which passage the Rambam requires to be omitted when one prays alone. The Rambam's statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, appear to define <i>Kedushah</i> as only the first of these three verses.</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though there is no explicit source to this effect, a number of midrashim (e.g., <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 23:4) lead to this conclusion.</p>
<p>One of the communal rites listed in <i>Megillah</i> 23b which requires a <i>minyan</i> is ברכת אבלים - the blessing one utters to those in mourning. For the recitation of that blessing, the presence of ten men other than the mourner himself is required. (See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 13:1.) Perhaps the Rambam feels that this statement is necessary to clearly distinguish between the different requirements of a <i>minyan</i> for prayer and ברכת אבלים.</i>.<br>Even if some of them have already prayed and fulfilled their obligation, they can complete the [quorum of] ten provided the majority of the ten have not prayed.<br>Similarly, we should not recite <i>Kedushah</i>, read the Torah with its blessings before and after it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 12, Halachah 3.</i>, or read the <i>haftorah</i> from the Prophets except in [a quorum of] ten."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.11,"Only a person of great stature within the community in both wisdom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Torah knowledge</i> and deed should be appointed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> mentions that this applies only to the appointment of a permanent <i>chazan</i> and does not apply to someone who leads the congregation in prayer on occasion. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 53:6) mentions this in regard to a <i>chazan</i> having a full beard.</i> as the leader of the congregation. If he is an older man<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the Hebrew, זקן, is often used to connote a wise man (See <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 6:1), this translation has been chosen based on the later statements of this halachah.</i>, it is very praiseworthy. An effort should be made to appoint as the leader of the congregation, someone who has a pleasant voice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> so that listening to his prayers will be enjoyable.</p>
<p>Throughout the generations, in their responsa, our Rabbis have chided the people for putting a pleasant voice at the top of their priorities for a <i>chazan</i>. [Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 53:5) who states that it is preferable to appoint a boy of thirteen who understands his prayers as <i>chazan</i> rather than an older man with a pleasant voice who does not know what he is saying. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 53:11).]</p>
<p>In particular, this applies regarding the High Holiday services. These days of sincere prayer should not be turned into concerts of ritual music. Instead, attempts should be made to find a <i>chazan</i> who can truly serve as a spiritual leader. If he also has a pleasant voice, it is obviously more desirable.</i> and is familiar with reading [Biblical verses].<br>A person who does not have a full beard<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rabbis have explained that this simply refers to a person of intermediate age. Therefore, in one of his responsa, the Rambam states that a person who is physically incapable of growing a beard may serve as <i>chazan</i> and the requirement of a beard is only mentioned as a sign of ""a full state of knowledge which one [usually] reaches at the age when one's beard begins to grow."" See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 53:8).</p>
<p>However, a beard is also considered a sign of commitment to Jewish practice. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 12:7) associates shaving with the practices of gentile priests. Many Rabbis have strongly encouraged growing a beard even when there is no question of violating the prohibition against shaving. (See <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> 7, <i>Shibolei Leket</i> Vol. II, 41.)</p>
<p>However, in communities where removing one's facial hair in a permitted manner is an accepted practice, the lack of a beard is not considered as a deterrent against a person serving as a <i>chazan</i>.</i> should not be appointed as the leader of the congregation even if he be a wise man of great stature, as a gesture of respect to the congregation. However, he may recite the <i>Shema</i> publicly a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>haporeis al Shema</i> as described in Halachah 5.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.1,"It is a positive commandment of the Torah to eat matzah on the night of the fifteenth [of Nisan], as [Exodus 12:18] states: ""In the evening, you shall eat matzot."" This applies in every place and at every time. Eating [matzah] is not dependent on the Paschal sacrifice. Rather, it is a mitzvah in its own right. The mitzvah may be fulfilled throughout the entire night.<br>Throughout the other days of the festival, eating matzah is left to one's choice: If one desires, one may eat matzah. If one desires, one may eat rice, millet, roasted seeds, or fruit. Nevertheless, on the night of the fifteenth alone, [eating matzah] is an obligation. Once one eats the size of an olive, he has fulfilled his obligation.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or other similar foods that do no<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 108a relates that Rav Sheshet would fast the entire day even though he was not a firstborn.</i>t satiate one's appetite</i>"
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.2,"A person who swallows matzah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> gulping it down, without chewing or tasting it</i> [without chewing it] fulfills his obligation. A person who swallows maror<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in the same manner</i> [without chewing it] does not fulfill his obligation. A person who swallows matzah and maror together fulfills the obligation of matzah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as above. There is an added undesirable factor in eating matzah in this manner. Preferably, no other substances should be eaten with the matzah, so that only its taste will be sensed. (Indeed, were he to chew both the matzah and the maror, he would not fulfill his obligation (See <i>Pesachim</i> 115a). To insure that nothing negate the taste of the matzah, in many communities it is customary not to dip the matzah in salt when eating it at the seder).</i>, but not that of maror, for the maror is secondary to the matzah. If he wrapped them in fibers or the like and swallowed them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the matzah, maror, and fibers</i>, he does not even fulfill the obligation of matzah."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.3,"A person who eats matzah without the intention [to fulfill the mitzvah]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah touches on a question left unresolved by the Talmud (see <i>Pesachim</i> 114b), and which has become a source of debate and discussion among the Rabbis in subsequent generations. Does a person who performs the deed of a mitzvah, without the intention to carry out God's command, fulfill his obligation, or not?</i> - e.g., gentiles or thieves force him to eat - fulfills his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It appears that the Rambam does not require a person to have the intention to fulfill a mitzvah, for in this instance the only reason the person ate the matzah was the coercion of the gentiles. Nevertheless, the commentaries qualify the Rambam's statements, based on <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person who occupies himself with blowing shofar to learn does not fulfill his obligation... one does not fulfill his obligation until both the person hearing [the shofar] and the one sounding it intend to fulfill the obligation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In resolution, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage from <i>Keritot</i> 19b.</p>
<p>Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only מתעסק (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the present context, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him. In contrast, since his body did not benefit from hearing the shofar, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears the shofar blown in the proper manner.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 475:4) quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> opinion as regards <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> adds the explanation mentioned in the name of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. (It must be noted that the <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries do not accept this decision). In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 589:8, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes the Rambam's decision concerning blowing the shofar, stating that a מתעסק does not fulfill the mitzvah. Similar decisions are rendered concerning <i>kriat shema</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60) and lulav and etrog (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651).</i>.<br>A person who ate a כזית matzah in delirium, while possessed by an epileptic fit, and afterwards recovered, is obligated to eat another [<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> כזית] — to fulfill the mitzvah because</i>כזית]. The consumption of [the first כזית] took place while he was free from the obligation to perform any mitzvot."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.4,"A person does not fulfill the obligation of eating matzah unless he partakes [of matzah made] from one of the five species<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> wheat, rye, barley, oats, and spelt, as stated in Halachah 5:1.</i> [of grain], as [Deuteronomy 16:3]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Challah</i> 1:2), the Rambam cites two verses while explaining this principle: Exodus 12:18, ""in the evening, you shall eat matzot"" and the verse cited here. Similarly, certain manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> contain both verses. The fact that the mitzvah to eat matzah is derived from the verse in Exodus and not the verse in Deuteronomy tends to support the text which quotes both verses. However, <i>Pesachim</i> 35a, the source for the exegesis of this verse, only mentions one verse.</i> states: ""Do not eat chametz upon it... eat matzot for seven days.""<br>[From the verse's association of chametz and matzah, we may derive:] substances which can become leavened may be eaten as matzah to fulfill one's obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as evident from the following halachah, the actual dough used to make the matzah need not have the potential to become leavened. However, the species of grain used as flour must be fit to become leavened. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, Halachah 5.)</i>. In contrast, other substances - e.g., rice, millet, and <i>kitniyot</i> - cannot be used to fulfill the obligation of matzah, for they can never become leavened."

However, the Ra'avad and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:1) forbid the use of matzah made with any liquid other than water for use at the seder.</i>. A person who kneaded [dough with one of these liquids] does not fulfill his obligation.<br>One cannot fulfill his obligation with matzah made from thin bran or coarse<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as mentioned above, there is a debate among the Rabbis which Hebrew term is appropriate to which type of bran.</i> bran.

They draw support from the Rambam's statements in Halachah 10 and maintain that he also accepts this restriction.</p>

<p>However, one might think this is true only in the beginning; ultimately (i.e., after eating the matzah), he is obligated to pay him money (and thus the matzah itself is no longer the property of the original owner.)</p>
<p>Rabbi Yochanan states: ""A mitzvah is not a sin."" Rabbi Yossi states: ""A sin is not a mitzvah."" Rabbi Illa said: ""Only when the mitzvot are performed as prescribed are they mitzvot.""</p>

<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 454:4) quotes the Rambam's statements exactly. Nevertheless, Rabbi Akiva Eiger maintains that since the stolen object no longer belongs to the original owners once it has been eaten, one may fulfill the mitzvah of matzah in this manner. All authorities agree that a person who stole grain or flour can fulfill his obligation with matzah made from it.</p>
<p>Rabbenu Manoach maintains that this instance is not dependent on the general rulings governing mitzvot performed with forbidden objects. Rather, <i>Pesachim</i> 38a draws an analogy between the mitzvot of matzah and Challah. Since there is an explicit teaching requiring a person to own the dough he uses for Challah, it thus follows that the matzah he uses must also be his undisputed property.</i>.<br>This is the governing principle: All [matzah] upon which the grace after meals is recited may be used to fulfill one's obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to eat matzah on Pesach.</i>.

The Rabbis did not institute a fast for the Ninth of Tammuz as well, for it was felt that this would be an excessive burden for the people (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 549:4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:8, because of the many difficulties suffered by the Jewish people, they miscalculated the date, and, even during the destruction of the First Temple, it was on the Seventeenth of Tammuz that Jerusalem's walls were breached.</i><br>d) Apostmos, the wicked, burned a Torah scroll<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Meiri identifies this as the Torah scroll written by Ezra the Scribe.

Fasts 5.5,"And the entire Jewish people follow the custom of fasting at these times and on the Thirteenth of Adar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this phrase to mean that our obligation to fast on these days is a custom accepted by the Jewish people after the destruction of the Second Temple.

<p>Our translation follows the standard published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.

<p>The fast of the Thirteenth of Adar is also referred to as <i>Ta'anit Esther</i>, ""the fast of Esther.""</p>
<p>When the fast of Esther became a formal part of Jewish observance is a matter of question. It is not mentioned in the Talmud. Furthermore, <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i>, a text which mentions all the fasts and festivals observed in the Talmudic era, does not mention this fast and speaks of the thirteenth of Adar, the day on which the fast of Esther is observed, as a day of celebration, the Day of Nicanor, marking the defeat of the Greek general of that name in the Hasmonean wars. It was not until after the destruction of the Temple that the observance of the dates mentioned in <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i> was nullified. This would appear to indicate that the observance of the Fast of Esther was of later origin.</p>
<p>In contrast, there is evidence pointing to the establishment of the Fast of Esther early in the Talmudic period. The <i>Sheiltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon, <i>Parshat Vayakhel</i> 67, speak of the observance of the Fast of Esther in the time of the Mishnah. Even if this teaching is not accepted as historical fact, we can glean from it that in Rav Achai's time, shortly after the conclusion of the Talmud, the fast was already a long-standing custom.</p>
<p>Significantly, because of the difference in status between it and the other commemorative fasts, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 686:2) rules far more leniently in regard to this fast than in regard to the others.</i>.""<br>If the Thirteenth of Adar falls on the Sabbath, the fast is pushed forward and held on Thursday, which is the eleventh of Adar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam mentions, if the date of a commemorative fast falls on Friday, the fast is held on that day. Nevertheless, it is improper for a fast that is not scheduled for such a day to be held then, since this is not proper reverence for the Sabbath (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>. If, however, any of the [dates of] other fasts fall on the Sabbath, the fasts are postponed until after the Sabbath. If [the dates of] these fasts fall on Friday, we should fast on Friday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the fixed calendar we follow at present, this is a rare occurrence. Only the Tenth of Tevet (in the northern hemisphere a relatively short fast) can fall on Friday. Even this does not happen frequently.</i>.<br>On all these fasts, the trumpets are not sounded, nor is the <i>Ne'ilah</i> service recited. The passage <i>Vay'chal</i> i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> beginning Exodus 32:11.</i>s read from the Torah, however, in both the morning and the afternoon services.<br>On all these [fasts], with the exception of Tish'ah B'Av, we may eat and drink at night."
Fasts 5.6,"When the month of Av enters<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Significantly, the Rambam does not mention any restrictions from the period beginning the Seventeenth of Tammuz. During this period, it is the Askenazic custom (see Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 551:2,4; <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 122:1-3) to observe certain restrictions - e.g., prohibitions against marrying, against reciting the blessing <i>Shehecheyanu</i>, and against cutting one's hair. From the beginning of Av, however, other restrictions are also added.</i>, we reduce our joy. During the week of Tish'ah B'Av<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> from the Sabbath before the fast onward.</p>
<p>According to Ashkenazic custom, all the activities mentioned by the Rambam are forbidden from Rosh Chodesh Av onward.</i>, it is forbidden to cut one's hair, to do laundry<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> it is customary to observe this prohibition even if one does not intend to wear the garment until after the fast (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 551:3).</i>, or to wear a pressed garment - even one of linen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Linen garments will not appear as distinguished after washing as those of other fabrics (<i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 551).</i> - until after the fast.<br>It has already been accepted as a Jewish custom not to eat meat<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or fowl. <i>Bava Batra</i> 60b states that it would have been proper for the Jews to refrain from eating meat and drinking wine at all times in mourning over the loss of the opportunity to partake of the sacrificial meat and the loss of the wine libations. The Sages felt, however, that such a decree would be too stringent for the people to observe and hence, did not institute it.</i> or enter a bathhouse during this week until after the fast. There are places that follow the custom of refraining from slaughtering from Rosh Chodesh Av until after the fast."
Fasts 5.7,"All [the restrictions of] Tish'ah B'Av<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> mentioned in Halachot 10 and 11</i> apply at night as well as during the day. One may not eat after sunset [of the previous day]; [it is forbidden to eat] between sunset and the appearance of the stars<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 34b explains that the Sages were undecided whether this period of time, known as <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>, should be considered to be part of the night or the day. Hence, it is necessary to be stringent both at the entry and the departure of a day associated with halachic restrictions.</i>, as on Yom Kippur.<br>One should not eat meat or drink wine at the meal before the fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the <i>seudah hamafseket</i>. Even a person who does not observe the custom of refraining from these foods during the week of Tish'ah B'Av (or the Nine Days according to Ashkenazic custom), should refrain from partaking of them in this meal. This meal should be characterized by mourning and sadness, and these foods bring happiness.</p>
<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:25) associates Ezekiel 32:27: ""And their sins will be upon their bones"" with eating meat and drinking wine at this meal.</i>. One may, however, drink grape juice that has not been left [to ferment] for three days. One may eat salted meat that was slaughtered more than three days previously<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The prohibition against eating meat was derived from the fact that with the Temple's destruction, the sacrifices were nullified. Since no sacrificial meat could be eaten on the third day and afterwards, this restriction does not apply to such meat (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 552:5).</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:2) and the later authorities explain that, at present, it is customary to refrain from partaking of even these foods at this meal.</i>. One should not eat two cooked dishes."
Fasts 5.8,"When does the<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> need to observe the restrictions mentioned</i> above apply? When one ate [this meal] in the afternoon on the day preceding Tish'ah B'Av. If, however, one eats a meal before noon, although this is the last meal one eats before the fast, one may eat all that one desires<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For then, one is still far removed from the fast itself.</i>.<br>When the day before Tish'ah B'Av falls on the Sabbath, one may eat and drink to the full extent of one's needs, and one may serve even a meal resembling Solomon's feasts at one's table<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are some authorities (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>) who recommend observing certain practices associated with mourning at the third Sabbath meal. Their opinions are not, however, accepted as halachah.</p>
<p>There is, however, one aspect in which this third Sabbath meal differs from the way this meal is eaten throughout the year. Generally, we are allowed to continue this meal into the night. When the fast of Tish'ah B'Av begins on Sunday, however, we must cease eating at sunset. (See Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:10.)</i>.<br>Similarly, when Tish'ah B'Av falls on the Sabbath, one need not withhold anything at all."
Fasts 5.10,"Pregnant women and those who are nursing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> although absolved from fasting on the other commemorative fasts</i> must complete their fasts on Tish'ah B'Av.<br>[On this day,] it is forbidden to wash in either hot or cold water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the sake of pleasure. One may, however, wash one's hands to remove filth or for ritual purposes. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and commentaries, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 544:9-10.)</i>; it is even forbidden to place one's finger in water. Similarly, anointing oneself for the sake of pleasure<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in contrast to anointment for hygienic or medicinal reasons</i>, wearing shoes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> is forbidden. One may, however, wear shoes made from other materials. Even leather shoes are permitted in certain instances. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:17.)</i>, and sexual relations are forbidden, as on Yom Kippur<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With this phrase, the Rambam refers the reader to his discussion of these prohibitions and the leniencies that may be granted in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i>.</i>.<br>In places where it is customary to do work, one may work<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If, however, a person desires to refrain from working because of the unique nature of the day, he may.</i>. In places where it is not customary to work, one should not. Torah scholars everywhere should remain idle on this day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For they should set examples to the people at large. Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:6, where he writes that ""Performing work on this day is very disgraceful.""</i>. Our Sages said, ""Whoever performs work on this day will never see a sign of blessing forever."""
Fasts 5.11,"Torah scholars<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Indeed, this applies also the people as a whole. Torah scholars are mentioned because they are expected to be more sensitive to the tragedy of our loss on Tish'ah B'Av.</p>
<p>The Rambam's choice of wording is based on his interpretation of the <i>Tosefta, Ta'anit</i> 3:11, ""<i>Chaverim</i> should not exchange greetings on Tish'ah B'Av,"" for the term <i>chaverim</i> is often used as a reference to Torah scholars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:20), however, interprets <i>chaverim</i> in its literal sense, that it means ""friends.""</i> should not exchange greetings on Tish'ah B'Av. Instead, they should sit in agony and frustration like mourners<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nothing should be done to distract one's attention from the loss.</p>
<p>With the above expression, the Rambam also explains the rationale for these laws. When the Sages ordained the commemoration of Tish'ah B'Av, they structured its observance to resemble Yom Kippur in certain contexts, and to resemble the laws of mourning in others.</i>. If a common person greets them, they should reply to him weakly, in a somber tone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> So that he also appreciates the nature of the day. See also Chapter 3, Halachah 8.</i>.<br>On Tish'ah B'Av, it is forbidden to read from the Torah, the Prophets, or the Sacred Writings [or to study] the Mishnah, Torah law, the Talmud, or the Aggadic works.
