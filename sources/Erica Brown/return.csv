Foreword 1,"<p class=""body-first"">OU Press is proud to join with Maggid Books in co-publishing Erica Brown’s sensitive and searching exploration of the world of teshuva.</p>"
Foreword 2,"<p class=""body"">For many, Maimonides’ classic, <span class=""it-text"">The Laws of Repentance</span>, gives structure to the emotional, psychological, intellectual, and religious components of teshuva, and serves as a wellspring of understanding for teshuva. Dr. Brown includes selections from <span class=""it-text"">The Laws of Repentance</span> in each chapter of this excellent book. In her Preface, she mentions the custom of studying one of the ten chapters of <span class=""it-text"">The</span> <span class=""it-text"">Laws of Repentance</span> on each day of <span class=""it-text"">Asseret Yemei Teshuva</span>. Teshuva is a goal; it comes in stages, intermittently. Our daily study reflects this concept of teshuva as an incremental process. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, the towering rabbinic authority of the twentieth century, notes this custom with approval in his <span class=""it-text"">Al HaTeshuva</span>, and relates that his father, as well as his grandfather, the famed Rav Hayim of Brisk, studied one chapter of <span class=""it-text"">The Laws of Repentance</span><span class=""it-text""> </span>on each day of <span class=""it-text"">Asseret Yemei Teshuva</span>.<span class=""it-text""> </span>Rabbi Soloveitchik speculates that the division of the work into ten chapters may well have been a deliberate allusion by Maimonides to the ten days of <span class=""it-text"">Asseret Yemei Teshuva</span>.</p>"
Foreword 3,"<p class=""body"">Maimonides highlights the unique quality of <span class=""it-text"">Asseret Yemei Teshuva</span>: “Even though any time is appropriate for teshuva and prayer, during the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur teshuva is more appropriate, and it is accepted immediately.” In one of the most lyrical passages in all of halakhic literature, Maimonides describes the power of teshuva: “How wonderful teshuva is, that it brings one close to the Divine Presence. Teshuva brings close those who are far away. Only yesterday he was loathed by the Almighty, repulsive, distant, and despicable; and today he is beloved, pleasing, close, and dear…. How lofty and exalted is the power of teshuva. Only yesterday he was separated from the God of Israel, crying out to no avail, and today he cleaves to the Divine Presence, cries out, and is answered immediately.” It is this magical transformative gift of teshuva which Dr. Brown so effectively helps us grasp.</p>"
Foreword 4,"<p class=""body"">Erica Brown has had an exceptional impact on the Jewish scene. With her rare ability to convey the wisdom of our sages to a contemporary audience, she has raised an awareness of Jewish learning that is striking. We are indebted to her for this book, in which she gives us the tools to navigate the process of teshuva during the time between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, a time suffused with hope and promise.</p>"

Difficult work lies ahead.</p>"
Preface 2,"<p class=""body"">Believing the words of our prayers during this season<span class=""no-break""> –</span> namely that repentance, prayer, and charity annul the evil decree<span class=""no-break""> –</span> many people have the custom of intensifying their good works and charitable impulses during these ten days. It is customary to increase one’s performance of mitzvot and study during this period. Some people are even more scrupulous in their <span class=""it-text"">kashrut</span> observance. While cynics may think this is just hedging one’s bets, we all recognize the importance of building up spiritual muscle with enhanced use during a period of judgment. Good habits breed better habits and have a spillover effect from one day to the next. Whatever we can do to stimulate greater piety, introspection, and goodness will help us in the coming year to be more loving, more pious, more thoughtful, and more kind.</p>"
Preface 3,"<p class=""body"">The pages ahead contain food for thought (even when we’re fasting) for each of these ten days. Each day offers an essay on a biblical or rabbinic theme related to self-improvement and presents “Life Homework,” a behavioral charge to help us exercise that muscle practically. Each chapter ends with text questions on three passages for study that span almost a thousand years of Jewish learning. The first comes from <span class=""it-text"">The</span> <span class=""it-text"">Laws of</span><span class=""it-text""> Repentance</span> written by Maimonides (1135–1204); the ten chapters in <span class=""it-text"">The</span> <span class=""it-text"">Laws of Repentance</span> inspired many people to study one chapter a day for these ten days. The second passage is from <span class=""it-text"">The Path of the Just </span>by Rabbi Moshe Haim Luzzatto (1707–1746). The third source is <span class=""it-text"">The Lights of</span><span class=""it-text""> Repentance</span>, written by Rabbi Abraham Isaac HaCohen Kook (1865–1935). The texts gathered in the study section and throughout embody thousands of years of thinking and dreaming about what it means to become a better person in Jewish tradition.</p>"
Preface 4,"<p class=""body"">Many works of self-improvement cited in the pages that follow surfaced during the <span class=""it-text"">Musar</span> movement, a nineteenth-century ethical/behavioral crusade that spread throughout Eastern Europe largely in response to the over-intellectualization of Judaism. Teshuva means return. <span class=""it-text"">Musar</span> means turn. Both filter into Jewish writings to reflect a profound desire to fix that which is broken, repair relationships, and strengthen intimacy with God.</p>"
Preface 5,"<p class=""body"">Teshuva, the belief and the mandate that we really can and must change, is one of the greatest gifts that Judaism gave the world. And it is one of the greatest gifts we can give ourselves, one that demands hard internal work because teshuva requires good decision-making. The poet Robert Browning once bemoaned the difficulty of making decisions: “Life’s business being just the terrible choice.” But choose we must: every word we say, every small gesture, every action is a decision that has a causal impact on the next decision. Every day, three times daily according to tradition, we pray for forgiveness, appealing to God as both parent and judge: “Forgive us, our Father, for we have sinned. Pardon us, our King, for we have transgressed, for You pardon and forgive. Blessed are You, Lord, the gracious One who repeatedly forgives.” We repeatedly sin so we ask that God repeatedly forgive. We make a daily habit of asking for God’s pardon. But at this time of the year, we ask that God give us the wisdom and strength to make good decisions so that our repeated pattern of moral weakness and apology will finally be broken.</p>"
Preface 6,"<p class=""body"">The Hasidic master, Rabbi Simha Bunim of Pzhysha, once said, “On Rosh HaShana the world begins anew, and before it begins anew, it comes to a close. Just as before dying, all the powers of the body clutch hard at life, so a person at the turn of the year ought to clutch at life with all his strength and might.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;As retold in Martin Buber, Tales of the Hasidim: Later Masters (New York: Schocken Books, 1977), 252.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"

Introduction: Teshuva as Recovery 1,"<p class=""_8-Quotation--prelims-at-top-of-page-"">“For the sin we committed before You by being stubborn.”</p>"
Introduction: Teshuva as Recovery 2,"<p class=""chapter-first""><span class=""First-Letter"">R</span><span class=""optical"">abbi </span>Jonah of Gerona (d. 1263) called repentance a sanctuary, a place to escape the intensity of sin. It is also the place to embrace the strength needed to fight our hardest inner battles and our stubborn resistance to change. By calling repentance a sanctuary, Rabbi Jonah in <span class=""it-text"">Sha’arei Teshuva</span> (The Gates of Repentance) transformed an act into a space we can step into and know that we are home, and we are safe. We have returned to our essential selves, the people we like best. We are at one with forces that usually rage within us, pulling us between good and evil, generosity and self-absorption, selflessness and narcissism.</p>"
Introduction: Teshuva as Recovery 3,"<p class=""body"">Almost eight hundred years later, Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, too, described the sanctuary of teshuva and how it envelops us on these holiest of days:</p>"
Introduction: Teshuva as Recovery 4,"<p class=""extract-first"">Jews do confess, but confession is a private matter between the individual and the Almighty. In my opinion, this is because of the Jew’s typical modesty and shyness. The noblest and most exalted feelings that the Jew experiences must remain like the Ark of the Covenant, concealed behind the curtain. “And the curtain shall separate for you between the holy and the Holy of Holies” (Exodus 26:33). The sanctuary of the human person is his emotional life, not his logical life. The Ark is with us in each person’s emotional life, concealed behind the curtain.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, from his lecture “The Abridged Havinenu Prayer” at the Rabbinic Council of America Midwinter Conference (Feb. 7, 1968); retold in Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff, The Rav: The World of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik (New York: Ktav, 1999), 2:167.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Introduction: Teshuva as Recovery 5,"<p class=""body-first"">Sometimes this Ark is so concealed that it is not always easy to locate our sanctuary of repentance. Even though we may be painfully aware of the need to change, we may lack the tools, the resilience, or the commitment to take on the demons of a difficult past or the challenges that come with the future. Rabbi Jonah was deeply concerned with those who put off the process of change and improvement, believing that such individuals only intensify their own problems: “Deferment of repentance is found only among the ignorant, who lie asleep and do not commune with their hearts, and who possess neither the knowledge nor the understanding to hasten to save themselves.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rabbi Jonah, The Gates of Repentance, trans. Shraga Silverstein (Jerusalem: Feldheim Publishers, 1967), 5.&lt;/i&gt;</span> Those who know how to repent are those who can commune with their hearts, who can recognize with exquisite sensitivity where they are falling short of the mark. The rest of us lie asleep even when we are awake. We fail to save ourselves.</p>"
Introduction: Teshuva as Recovery 6,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Jonah offers us more than inspirational messages. To be effective, teshuva must move us all the way from regret to a place of profound change. The change must make us so distant from where we once were that we are actually able to instruct and guide others to avoid what was once a major source of personal temptation or spiritual weakness in ourselves. It is as if we were to look at an old photograph of ourselves. We recognize the image and the likeness but also know that we are not that same person anymore. Rabbi Jonah presents the anatomy of an apology as an outline for transformation in his table of contents, offering twenty steps that contribute to the process of true change.</p>"

Day One: Faith 1,"<p class=""_8-Quotation--prelims-at-top-of-page-"">“For the sin we committed before You by throwing off the yoke of heaven.”</p>"
Day One: Faith 2,"<p class=""chapter-first""><span class=""First-Letter"">O</span><span class=""optical"">n </span>the first day of Rosh HaShana, our Torah reading is dominated by an unlikely character, a foreign servant woman who becomes a key player in the fertility struggle of Abraham and Sarah: Hagar. Her appearance takes us off guard. She receives not one chapter in the unfolding of Genesis, but two. The story of her promotion to wife and then first mother, followed by her sudden banishment, is painful and uncomfortable to read. She seems to be a pawn in a story far greater than herself. Her story strangely occupies a large emotional space in Abraham’s narratives of faith, and it is reviewed on one of our most solemn liturgical occasions.</p>"
Day One: Faith 3,"<p class=""body"">Hagar is introduced as an Egyptian maidservant with a name that means “stranger”; everything about her is remote and distant. She comes from elsewhere and occupies a low station in Abraham’s household. Midrashim about her former position as princess notwithstanding, the text presents a woman with no status whatsoever. Hagar is introduced in our story only after Abraham has already toyed with possible solutions to his problem of an heir. Sarah’s infertility is mentioned early on, when we first meet the future matriarch: “Now Sarai was barren, she had no child” (Genesis 11:30). By the time Abraham is tasked with creating a nation, the reader already understands the challenges ahead. As a first solution, Abraham takes his nephew Lot with him, and his name is mentioned in Abraham’s travels to Canaan before Sarah’s is. He is clearly regarded as the likely heir until the two parties have property skirmishes and separate. Abraham then asks God if his house servant Eliezer should be his heir, but God rejects this option. In Genesis 15, Abraham is told explicitly that the solution to his problem will come from his belly, literally: “None but your very own issue shall be your heir” (15:4). The child is to come from him. It will not be Lot. It will not be Eliezer. But the child will not necessarily be the offspring of Sarah, either, since it is Abraham’s “womb” and not Sarah’s that God specifies.</p>"
Day One: Faith 4,"<p class=""body"">Perhaps Sarah overheard this conversation or it was reported to her; whatever precipitates her action, she decides at this juncture to take fate into her own hands. She gives her maidservant to Abraham. She does not perform this as an act of generosity to help her husband fulfill the divine promise of Genesis 12 that Abraham will father a nation. Each nation begins with one. And Abraham, try as he might, cannot come up with the first one. Genesis 16 explicitly states Sarah’s motive in her own words: “Perhaps <span class=""it-text"">I</span> shall have a son through her [lit. “be built up through her”]” (16:2). Abraham will get an heir, she reckons, as part of some larger divine scheme, but she chances not being part of this majestic, historic tale. Sarah has to act to guarantee her own place. Maybe, just maybe, she can have a son through surrogacy, solving her emotional anguish and also cementing her historic significance as the mother of a nation.</p>"
Day One: Faith 5,"<p class=""body"">Sarah gives her maid over as a wife rather than a concubine, a term in rabbinic parlance that implies a wife but one without the financial security of a marriage contract. In doing this, Sarah changes Hagar’s status monumentally, moving her from a subordinate figure in the household to one almost on par with herself. When Hagar gets pregnant and then ridicules Sarah, Hagar has, of her own accord, shifted the power balance again, lording her new position in the house as first mother over her former mistress. In actuality, Hagar could have belittled Sarah without much effort. Seeing Hagar’s growing stomach is signal enough for Sarah to experience inadequacy. Phyllis Trible describes the changing scales of power in the Sarah/Hagar story beautifully in her book <span class=""it-text"">Texts of Terror</span>:<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Phyllis Trible, Texts of Terror: Literary-Feminist Readings of Biblical Narratives (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985), 9–35.&lt;/i&gt;</span> a woman of little significance is suddenly moved to center stage, pushing aside the female protagonist who could not deliver.</p>"
Day One: Faith 6,"<p class=""body"">Sarah’s indignity at her sudden change in position is a source of outrage. She turns to Abraham with her humiliation: “The wrong done me is your fault! I myself put my maid in your bosom; now that she sees that she is pregnant, I am lowered in her esteem. The Lord decide between me and you!” (16:5). Sarah had thought she was helping the family with this arrangement, but she comes to realize the mistake of it all. In Sarah’s failed attempt to build herself up through Hagar, she is ironically made small though her. The Bible commentator Rabbi Meir Leibush (1809–1879), known by the acronym Malbim, understood Hagar’s dismissal of Sarah as linked to the fact that Hagar conceived immediately; one might think Hagar was more righteous than her mistress. Sarah blames her indignity on Abraham; perhaps his own happiness at becoming a father was too much for Sarah. Hagar’s arrogance<span class=""no-break""> –</span> or her very existence<span class=""no-break""> –</span> becomes Sarah’s new blight.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;For more on this, see Jo Ann Hackett, “Rehabilitating Hagar: Fragments of an Epic Pattern,” in Gender and Difference in Ancient Israel, ed. Peggy L. Day (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1989), 12–19.&lt;/i&gt;</span> Sarah creates a challenge for Abraham. Rather than position herself against Hagar, Sarah gives Abraham a choice. He must choose a life with Sarah and her infertility, which means letting go of God’s larger vision of Abraham’s future, or choose the leadership role God determined for him, which he must pursue without her. Sarah can no longer see a way for Abraham to have his national, spiritual dream and to keep their relationship intact when she could not provide an heir.</p>"
Day One: Faith 7,"<p class=""body"">Abraham, wise patriarch that he was, responds to Sarah’s humiliation: “Your maid is in your hands. Deal with her as you think right” (16:6). This is Abraham’s clever way of telling his wife that this plan was her idea, not his. He had no emotional attachment to Hagar; just as she easily shifted from being Sarah’s maid to Abraham’s wife, Hagar can shift back to her old role without Abraham being invested in her change of status. Then Abraham tells Sarah to do with Hagar as <span class=""it-text"">she</span> deems right, returning to Sarah all the power she once had over this woman. There is irony in this statement. Sarah afflicts her maid, not knowing how to return this woman, pregnant with her husband’s heir, back to her former role without the use of verbal or physical violence; we are unsure how exactly to read the postscript: “Sarah treated her harshly, and she ran away from her” (16:6). Having tasted a modicum of freedom, Hagar is not prepared to redress the new imbalance and return to the indignity of servitude.</p>"
Day One: Faith 8,"<p class=""body"">This inverse story of Exodus, in which an Israelite enslaves an Egyptian, treats her harshly (using the same Hebrew terminology used to describe Pharaoh’s oppression of the Israelites), and forces her to run off to the wilderness to escape, has a different end than our national narrative.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;For mention of this narrative within others that also bear Exodus themes and language, see David Daube, The Exodus Pattern in the Bible (London: Faber and Faber, 1963).&lt;/i&gt;</span> Hagar finds herself near a spring and encounters an angel. He tells her to return to her place of anguish even though she will suffer there, because she will birth her own nation, beginning with Abraham’s first child, Ishmael. The child, the angel tells her, will be a “wild animal of a man; his hand against everyone and everyone’s hand against him” (16:12). The promise of a child of violence hardly seems a motivation to return unless, of course, Hagar believes that as a powerless slave, this is her best chance for her own future defense. Finally her defenselessness can become her empowerment; she has recourse to combat violence with violence, all to fulfill a larger vision of a nation: her own. The angel presages the message with what must have seemed a preposterous promise: “I will greatly increase your offspring, and they will be too many to count” (16:10). Oddly, Hagar is the only woman in the Hebrew Bible to receive the female version of Abraham’s blessing of multitudes. This promise unlocks the mystery of why we read Hagar’s story on Rosh HaShana, one of our holiest days.</p>"
Day One: Faith 9,"<p class=""body"">To understand the promise, we have to telescope forward to the text of Hagar that is included in our <span class=""it-text"">Maĥzor</span>: Genesis 21. Ishmael is likely seventeen, on the cusp of adulthood; his half-brother Isaac is being celebrated by his parents. Isaac, the miracle child, has been weaned, and Abraham makes a large feast. With Isaac’s viability, the issue of who will be Abraham’s heir comes into peak narrative tension.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;For more on this, see Naomi Steinberg, “The Sarah-Hagar Cycle: Polycoity,” in Kinship and Marriage in Genesis: A Household Economics Perspective (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993), 35–86.&lt;/i&gt;</span> Sarah, at the height of her happiness, sees “the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham playing” (21:9) and is reviled. Using a more subordinate Hebrew name for slave than was used in Genesis 16,<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;For a discussion of the difference between a shifĥa and an ama in Hebrew, see F. Charles Fensham, “The Son of a Handmaid in Northwest-Semitic,” Vetus Testamentum 19:3 (July, 1969), 312–321.&lt;/i&gt;</span> Sarah once again gives Abraham an unambiguous mandate: “Cast out that slave woman and her son, for the son of that slave shall not share in the inheritance with my son Isaac” (21:10). Neither son is called the child of Abraham; there is only the son of Hagar and the son of Sarah, pitted in Sarah’s mind in an intense competition for succession. Now that Ishmael is an adult and technically fit to be heir, Sarah sees his playing as either an erotic danger (as posited in one midrash), a strange childish aberration for a young adult, or a status problem for her son. Banishing Ishmael would leave only one child behind, Isaac, as if the birthright were a matter of geographic accessibility. Where Abraham listened to his wife before without emotional investment, here the text renders his anguish: “Abraham was greatly distressed for it concerned a son of <span class=""it-text"">his</span>” (21:12). Sarah may have easily cut out Abraham’s role as father in discussing Ishmael, but Abraham could not. The child was also <span class=""it-text"">his</span> child.</p>"
Day One: Faith 10,"<p class=""body"">God tells Abraham to listen to his wife, and Abraham dutifully sends out Hagar and Ishmael into an unforeseen future in the wilderness. He gives Hagar bread and a skin of water, putting it on her shoulder<span class=""no-break""> –</span> a last act of tenderness<span class=""no-break""> –</span> and mother and son set off. Many medieval commentators on this story question Abraham’s parsimony. When a slave was set free in the laws framed in Deuteronomy, he was entitled to more than this woman<span class=""no-break""> –</span> who was first a slave and then a wife<span class=""no-break""> –</span> received from her master/husband for her ignominious exit.</p>"
Day One: Faith 11,"<p class=""body"">Then Hagar gets lost and her water runs out. In despair, she puts her child, now a man, under a bush, not wanting to see her son die, presumably of dehydration. She sits a bow’s distance away and bursts into tears, but the angel this time only hears the weeping of the boy. The English rendering of the angel’s words sounds compassionate: “What troubles you, Hagar?” (21:17). The Hebrew is more remonstrative: “What is the matter with you, Hagar?” These three Hebrew words contain the key to unraveling this text and Hagar’s role in Abraham’s story.</p>"
Day One: Faith 12,"<p class=""body"">Hagar’s behavior here provides an ancient literary foil to demonstrate the extent of Abraham’s faith. Abraham is given a promise: to become a nation in a homeland. He is successful in his role as homesteader, amassing wealth and cattle, digging wells, fighting wars, and making covenants with neighboring peoples. But he struggles for more than a dozen chapters to make good on the pledge of a nation because he cannot produce even one heir. He finally has one child and then another, then banishes one child and then almost offers the other as a sacrifice, making him once again almost childless. He turns to God for guidance and direction, even when he stares into the abyss of ambiguity. God points him to a sky full of stars on several occasions with hopefulness, and Abraham never doubts Him despite immense confusion. Sarah sarcastically laughs at the promise of a child past her childbearing years. She doubts. Abraham, too, laughs, but it is a different laugh. It is the laughter of joy and relief, the chuffing of optimism. Hers is the laugh of disbelief. His is the laugh of faith.</p>"
Day One: Faith 13,"<p class=""body"">Hagar was given the same promise as Abraham, to be the progenitor of a nation, but when a simple physical obstruction stands in her way, she balks. She puts her child of promise near a bush, expecting him to die. When the angel comes to her, he opens Hagar’s eyes, and she beholds a well. The text does not say that God created a well, only that her eyes were opened, and she saw it for the first time. A solution lay right in front of her, but she lacked the ambition, the inspiration, or the faith to see it. Abraham, even when his vision was clouded, held on tightly to the promise and found the faith to surmount every obstacle until he achieved God’s word. Hagar let go too soon.</p>"
Day One: Faith 14,"<p class=""body"">We read Hagar’s story nestled into Abraham’s on Rosh HaShana to point to our own choices within the framework of faith and trust. Do we have the faith to hold on to a vision of a better future or does that vision collapse the moment something stands in the way? How strong is our faith? How determined are we to live a life of promise?</p>"
Day One: Faith 15,"<p class=""body"">Hagar acted as an ordinary mother would have<span class=""no-break""> –</span> but she had been given an extraordinary promise. Rather than nurture it with extraordinary determination, she let it go, opting for tears of self-pity. Self-pity is an easy place to visit. Hagar did have a very difficult life. But she also received a blessing of abundance that required effort and belief. She could not see that because she was overwhelmed by her powerlessness. A well lay before her<span class=""no-break""> –</span> a reservoir of blessing in the ancient Near East<span class=""no-break""> –</span> but she was blind to it. And when we read how quickly Hagar gave up on a divine promise, we become more awed by the fact that Abraham never gave up despite problems much more significant than those faced by his wife’s former slave. If we could not understand why Søren Kierkegaard called Abraham a knight of faith before we read Genesis 21, we understand the philosopher now.</p>"
Day One: Faith 16,"<p class=""body-first"">Sometimes we fall in love with our problems. They become us. We cannot live without the drama. We are too restless to appreciate the abundance that God has given us and instead of bowing deeply for <span class=""it-text"">Modim</span> (prayer of gratitude), we are stuck in one long <span class=""it-text"">Ta</span><span class=""it-text"">ĥ</span><span class=""it-text"">anun </span>(supplication of lowliness). Our problems give us something to talk about and someone else to blame. We see problems recurring when a situation does not change but do not necessarily take responsibility for changing it. We do not accept our own complicit role in our problems. It was easy enough for Hagar to blame Abraham for not giving her enough water to sustain her, for sending her away, for making her a helpless player in a narrative far larger than herself. It is easy enough to sit down and cry and become so entangled in a problem that we don’t even think about how to change it. We can all do that. We blame others. We blame God. But it does not advance us. Blame was not going to save Ishmael, and it is not going to save us.</p>"
Day One: Faith 17,"<p class=""body"">Faith demands patience in the face of a future that we cannot see and the determination to make good things happen. If we could know the future with certainty, we would not need faith. But because we cannot know, we have to trust in powers greater than ours to guide us. Our faith is not the passive faith of Hagar’s tears but the active joy of Abraham’s laugh. We admire his propulsion forward, his drive to create an ambitious, dream-worthy vision even if all of the particulars comprising that future were beyond his immediate understanding. Faith demands that we engage in a delicate dance of both relinquishing control to an authority above us and acting within our full human capacity to realize our dreams.</p>"
Day One: Faith 18,"<p class=""body"">On Rosh HaShana we celebrate God’s kingship by acknowledging God’s authority. We recommit ourselves to being faithful servants of the king. A faithful servant does not wait for a better future but, in partnership, creates one.</p>"

Day One: Faith 20,"<p class=""body-first-no-sp-b4"">Abraham’s faith demanded a contradictory blend of patience and impatience. Sometimes we need more patience to actualize ourselves and to make situations better. Sometimes we need impatience to achieve the same ends. We allow a situation to stay the same or fester because we do not take charge of shaping it. Wisdom demands that we know when to be patient and when to be impatient. Rosh HaShana offers us the opportunity to think about our own state of faith in the coming year. Ask yourself:</p>"

Day Two: Destiny 1,"<p class=""_8-Quotation--prelims-at-top-of-page-"">“For the sin we committed before You with a confused heart.”</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 2,"<p class=""chapter-first""><span class=""First-Letter"">R</span><span class=""optical"">osh </span>HaShana has its tastes, sounds, and texts. We think of symbolic food like pomegranates and apples dipped in honey. We hear the <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span>’s call for mercy and we revisit texts that are central to our tradition. One of them, the most difficult of them, is the binding of Isaac. It is in this text that both sound and time merge almost seamlessly. At once, we encounter the text, close our eyes, and mythically hear the ram’s horn that we imagine Abraham might have blown as a testament to his loyalty to God.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 3,"<p class=""body"">Unexpectedly, the biblical chapter that brought us the first <span class=""it-text-no-break"">shofar</span>’s blast is awkwardly quiet. In the binding of Isaac narration there is neither crying nor supplication. There are no petitions for mercy and no explanations. There is little noise. The silence of the nineteen verses that tell the story is overpowering. God asked something of Abraham with initially one word only: “Abraham.” Abraham responded, in kind, with one word: <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">Hineni</span>.” I am fully present and at Your command. It is as if Abraham had said, “My name is my destiny. Call it, and I will accept Your will.” And he did. Although God explained the task in limited detail, the test was essentially delivered in one word. Abraham’s <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">Hineni</span>” followed his name, not the description of the test that stood before him.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 4,"<p class=""body"">A few verses later, we find another almost wordless conversation of a similar kind. Isaac, too, called Abraham, but this time not by name but by role: “Father.” And to Isaac, Abraham also said <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">Hineni</span>,” followed by the most painful word in the chapter <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">beni</span>,” my son. With one son banished in the previous chapter and another about to be taken on a mountain altar of undisclosed location, Abraham would not have many chances to address his son again. The word must have dropped to the ground like a heavy weight.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 5,"<p class=""body"">Isaac wanted to know where the sheep was for the offering since the wood and the fire implement were in place. Isaac carried the wood. Abraham carried the fire starter and the knife. Isaac conveniently forgot to inquire about the knife in his description of their readiness. It was not an ordinary knife. A <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">ma’akhelet</span>”<span class=""no-break""> –</span> from the Hebrew word to consume<span class=""no-break""> –</span> is found in only one other place in the Hebrew Bible, in a text that makes readers shudder: chapter 19 of Judges. The knife Abraham used in Genesis and the one used in the Concubine of Givah text was used specifically to cut human flesh, not an act generally done within our faith tradition. No wonder poor Isaac forgot to mention it. Abraham explained their three-day sojourn together to Isaac in six truthful but elusive Hebrew words: “God will see to the sheep for His burnt offering, my son.” Again, the words “my son” end Abraham’s sentence with an ominous thud. The two proceed in silence.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 6,"<p class=""body"">Abraham said <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">Hineni</span>” one more time, after an angel called his name twice to stay his knife-wielding hand. It took one mention of Abraham’s name to begin his mission but two to stop it. Abraham looked up, trying to find a replacement for the child he never sacrificed. Although the narrative is all about following directions, and although Abraham stated unambiguously that God would show them the sheep for sacrifice, it was actually Abraham who identified the animal. It was a ram. “When Abraham looked up, his eye fell upon a ram caught in the thicket by its horns. Abraham offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son” (Genesis 22:13). And then, in the biblical tradition of renaming a location after an act of divine revelation, Abraham renamed the place where he stood: “And Abraham named that site Adonai-yireh, as it is called to this day ‘On the mount of the Lord there is vision’” (22:14).</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 7,"<p class=""body"">Abraham saw a ram, yet he named the mount after God’s long-term vision, not his own immediate vision. Abraham had passed the final test of his loyalty and, in so doing, praised the God who did <span class=""it-text"">not</span> ask him to sacrifice his son. There was a vision on that mount that was unlike anything else Abraham knew of the ultimate sacrifices demanded in other ancient Near Eastern faiths. It was as if God said to Abraham through the slow pace of the narration and its silence: “Know forevermore that this new faith will be a radical departure from whatever you know. It will never demand child sacrifice as surrounding faiths do. Instead it will demand ultimate trust, and that you have earned on this mountain today.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;To encounter this reading in greater academic depth, see Jon Levenson’s seminal work, Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995).&lt;/i&gt;</span> Although Abraham was not asked to offer an animal, perhaps he saw in that ram stuck in the thicket<span class=""no-break""> –</span> a place of entrapment and pain<span class=""no-break""> –</span> the symbolic representation of a life full of struggle that was finally easing.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 8,"<p class=""body"">For Abraham, the binding was about sight. For us, Abraham’s descendants, the binding is about sound. Abraham experienced a vision and named the place after that vision. He did not blow the ram’s horn on that mountain<span class=""no-break""> –</span> or, if he did, there is no recording of it. But somehow, the sound of the <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span><span class=""no-break""> –</span> so primitive and so plaintive<span class=""no-break""> –</span> echoes in Jewish history for all time and has always been associated with this story. A midrash on the sound of the <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span> in the transmission of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 advances the idea that the same <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span> was used at both Moriah and Sinai, presaging one person’s commitment of faith into that of an entire nation through a sound associated with mountain heights and divine authority.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 9,"<p class=""body"">The mystery of this instrument of faith was not lost on the rabbis of old. In a beautiful midrash on Genesis 22, the sages hold forth on the <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span>’s reach, taking us to the very day of its first use:</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 10,"<p class=""extract-first"">Throughout that day, Abraham saw the ram become entangled in a tree, break loose and go free, become entangled in a bush, break loose and go free; then again become entangled in a thicket, break loose and go free. The Holy One said, “Abraham, so will your children be entangled in many kinds of sin and trapped within successive kingdoms<span class=""no-break""> –</span> from Babylon to Media, from Media to Greece, from Greece to Rome.” Abraham asked, “Master of the Universe, will it be forever thus?” God replied, “In the end they will be redeemed by [the sound of] the horn of this ram.” (Genesis Rabba on Genesis 22:13)</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 11,"<p class=""body-first"">For Abraham, the <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span> was never about a sound. It was predominantly about a sight. Abraham saw an animal that symbolized himself, his son, and his fledgling nation, a ram that had difficulty negotiating its environs. It became entangled. It broke free. This pattern repeated itself.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 12,"<p class=""body"">Looking at this image, Abraham realized the metaphor unfolding before his eyes. But unlike his conclusion, God drew another from it that involved sound. When the <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span> is blown, it always signals redemption to those who hear it<span class=""no-break""> –</span> whether it is at Mount Sinai with the giving of the law or when slaves were freed in ancient days. The <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span> may look like entanglement<span class=""no-break""> –</span> but the <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span> sounds like freedom.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 13,"<p class=""body"">We cannot envision what it was like for Abraham or for Isaac to be on that mountain that day. The closest we can come to reenacting that moment of faith is by closing our eyes and imagining a <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span> being blown into the wind on the top of a mountain; it is the loneliest sound imaginable. That <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span>’s wail released all of the tears that were not shed on that day and all of the cries that were never emitted and all of the words that went unsaid. The anguish and the victory of it all is captured most potently with the primitive, primal scream of a <span class=""it-text"">shofa</span><span class=""_80-italic"">r</span>.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 14,"<p class=""body"">When the <span class=""it-text"">shofar</span> is blown on Rosh HaShana, all time collapses. We revisit our master story again and again, understanding that we are part of an ancient, treasured history, one of entanglement and also of redemption. The problem is to know when we are stuck and when we are just at the beginning of a breakthrough. Often the very same moment can appear to be both. We mistake trouble for possibility or do not see harm or temptation right ahead. Abraham saw a ram in a thicket, a live creature stuck in brambles. He offered up this animal as a testimony to a moment when he was ready to give one thing but was asked for another instead. His destiny could have taken one turn. Instead it took another.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 15,"<p class=""body"">Destiny does not always introduce itself. We have a chance encounter that ends up changing our lives because we are able to say at a moment’s notice, <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">Hineni</span>.” I am here. I am ready. Nahmanides understood that the verb <span class=""it-text"">nisa</span><span class=""no-break""> –</span> and God tested Abraham<span class=""no-break""> –</span> was fate calling Abraham to a test that God knew he could pass. Challenging tests of character common in the world of Greek gods and heroes helped the protagonist understand his own mettle, offering an affirmation of strength and pointing to a fate often unanticipated. A strange moment or obstacle suddenly becomes the beginning of a new and unexpected journey that becomes the journey of a lifetime.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 16,"<p class=""body"">This message of destiny and its enigmatic turns underlines much of our Rosh HaShana liturgy and fills the pages of the <span class=""it-text"">Ma</span><span class=""it-text"">ĥ</span><span class=""it-text"">zo</span><span class=""_80-italic"">r</span>. The <span class=""it-text"">haftara</span> on the first day of Rosh HaShana (<span class=""sc"">I</span> Samuel 1:1–2:10) affirms the role of fate and destiny in a plan we cannot totally fathom. After bringing her son Samuel to the Tabernacle as a servant for life following an emotional battle with infertility, Hannah offers a prayer. Surprisingly, it is not a prayer of thanksgiving but one that captures the seeming arbitrariness of a world of fate:</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 17,"<p class=""extract-first"">Then Hannah prayed and said, “My heart rejoices in the Lord; in the Lord my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in Your deliverance. There is no one holy like the Lord; there is no one besides You; there is no Rock like our God. Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the Lord is a God who knows, and by Him deeds are weighed. The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength. Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. The Lord brings death and makes alive; He brings down to the grave and raises up. The Lord sends poverty and wealth; He humbles and He exalts. He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; He seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. For the foundations of the earth are the Lord’s; upon them He has set the world.” (<span class=""sc"">I</span> Samuel 2:1–8)</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 18,"<p class=""body-first"">The prayer continues, but its message is already clear. Those who are poor may find themselves rich one day. Women who have no children may find themselves mothers one day. Warriors stumble. The needy sit with princes. Life as we know it is incomprehensible to the limitations of the human mind. Forces beyond our ken take over, and life as we know it changes dramatically.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 19,"<p class=""body"">James Kugel captures this oddity of fate and destiny in his essay “A Moment of Confusion” from <span class=""it-text"">The God of Old</span>.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;See James Kugel, The God of Old (New York: Free Press, 2004). Kugel reiterates this notion in his most recent book, In the Valley of the Shadow (New York: Free Press, 2011).&lt;/i&gt;</span> Encounters with angels in the Bible, says Kugel, often begin as seemingly coincidental visits between human beings. Abraham saw three guests passing his tent in the distance. They were actually angels who, after a time of sustaining normalcy, disclosed their real identities and predicted an entirely new path ahead for Abraham and his wife. After dozens of years of infertility, this couple would become parents, and the small nation they founded would have its first successor. Abraham was only the first of many to transition from one dimension to another in a human/angel encounter. Human beings in the ancient world, according to Kugel, navigated spiritual worlds in ways that modern human beings do not. They may not have recognized an angel before them, but they were not shocked by such meetings either. The transition from this-worldly to other-worldly was not staggering or dramatic but almost expected. There was a readiness to move within a dimension not visible. At any time, three angels might show up at your door with a message that could change your life for eternity. A bush might burn in flames but not be consumed. A sea might split when you stand on the cusp of its shore with hundreds of enemy chariots directly behind you. A moment of confusion turns into a moment of revelation without the skip of a heartbeat or the time to catch a breath.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 20,"<p class=""body"">You were about to do something that would change your life forever when an angel stayed your hand. At first you were confused, but you moved slowly enough to stop yourself, and in so doing, retrieved what you thought you were about to lose: the most important relationship in your life.</p>"

Day Two: Destiny 22,"<p class=""body"">We confess to confusion on Yom Kippur: <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">For the sin we committed before</span><span class=""it-text""> You with a confused heart</span>.”<span class=""it-text""> </span>How can confusion ever be a sin? It is not intentional. Confusion is not an act; it is a condition brought about by the ambiguities of a situation. But we can perpetuate confusion by not seeking clarity soon enough or at all. And for that, we confess. Confusion can do that to us. In the prayerbook of the Vilna Gaon, Rabbi Elijah Kramer (1720–1796), this plea includes acts of wrongdoing connected with confusion: doubting principles of faith or law or wondering about the historic existence of prophets or the reliability of Jewish texts. It can also be connected to the pain or anguish we cause ourselves and others because of doubt.</p>"
Day Two: Destiny 23,"<p class=""body"">We stay in a state of confusion by not recognizing that destiny does not always knock on our door and announce itself. We have to ready ourselves for a moment as sudden as the appearance of a ram in a thicket, as sudden as the answer to a prayer of infertility.</p>"

Day Two: Destiny 30,"<p class=""body"">In the Talmud, Rabbi Eleazar, a scholar at the Academy of Yavneh during the first century of the Common Era, said, “No is an oath, and yes is an oath.” Rava said an oath is only compelling if fully emphasized: “Only if one said, ‘no, no’ twice or ‘yes, yes’ twice.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Shevuot 36a.&lt;/i&gt;</span> Sometimes a “yes” or a “no” is not an honest answer.

Day Three: Discipline 3,"<p class=""body""><span class=""it-text"">Tzom Gedalia</span>, the fast of Gedalia, always follows Rosh HaShana. Most people are relieved for the break from food but do not necessarily understand why we observe this fast or what its significance is. In the annual words of my grandmother: “Who’s Gedalia, anyway?” So who is Gedalia, anyway, and why is this day significant?</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 4,"<p class=""body"">Gedalia was a procurator of Judah, assigned by King Nebuchadnezzar to govern the remaining Jews in Israel after the exile. Nebuchadnezzar decimated our nation and then banished the remaining residents from their land after destroying the Temple; those few who stayed became a straggling remnant of a lost nation. This is recounted in the book of <span class=""sc"">ii</span> Kings: “Thus, Judah was exiled from its land. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon put Gedalia, son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, in charge of the people whom he left in the land of Judah” (25:21–22). There was a great deal of anxiety about the treatment of this remnant, but Gedalia reassured a group of questioning officers that if the residents stayed in the land and followed the Babylonian authorities, “It will go well with you” (25:24). Seven months later, a day which some believe was actually Rosh HaShana, Ishmael ben Nethania<span class=""no-break""> –</span> one of the officers who had initially approached Gedalia and who was himself of royal descent<span class=""no-break""> –</span> came with ten men and murdered Gedalia and those with him. The rest of the people left Judah for Egypt, fearing the worst.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 5,"<p class=""body"">The story is recounted in greater detail in Jeremiah 41. The day after Gedalia was killed, when no one yet knew, a group of eighty men from the area came to see him, their garments torn and their bodies gashed. They were vulnerable and beaten, but they still came bearing offerings for the Temple, gifts that would never be given. The murderer Ishmael invited them into the town to see Gedalia and then slaughtered them and threw their bodies into a cistern. Ishmael then carried any remaining stragglers off in the direction of Ammon. A warrior, Johanan ben Karea, who set out to kill Ishmael, intervened and took the rest of the people to Egypt for protection. Ishmael got away. The rabbis declared a fast day to mourn not only the death of Gedalia but the death, in many ways, of the few remaining Jews in the land of Israel, killed essentially by their own, the worst possible way to end the enduring presence of the Jews in their homeland. The destruction of even one righteous person, they believed, was the equivalent of the destruction of the House of God.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rosh HaShana 18b.&lt;/i&gt;</span> We fast for one<span class=""no-break""> –</span> the destruction of the Temple; we must fast for the other<span class=""no-break""> –</span> the destruction of a human life that represented the end of Jewish life in the land of Israel at the time. The fast is mentioned in the book of Zechariah, with the climax at the end of the verse: “You must love honesty and integrity” (8:19).</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 6,"<p class=""body"">We mourn a righteous leader by fasting, but the fast is also intended to mourn the absence of Jews in the land of Israel long ago. Even when the Temple was destroyed, there was still a population of Jews inhabiting the land. After the exile, that population dwindled. But no Jews remained in their land after the murder of Gedalia. The fast offers us the opportunity, at a time of personal reflection, to think about collective losses of identity and how often we hurt ourselves more than outsiders ever could. Ishmael’s weakness made us all ultimately vulnerable.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 7,"<p class=""body"">We know the saying well. <span class=""it-text"">Ethics of the Fathers</span> asks, “Who is strong?” and replies, “One who conquers his desires” (4:1). When we discipline ourselves to achieve our deepest goals, we have mastery over desire instead of desire having mastery over us. Acting on impulse and the momentary need for gratification can unravel our best long-term personal objectives into a moral mess that is hard to clean up. It is not easy to face the consequences of our actions, particularly of our transgressions. It takes emotional strength and resilience to face the worst of ourselves and improve our attitude and behavior without being overwhelmed by sadness or paralyzed by depression: “I just can’t do it.” And when we articulate those words, we really believe them. We have convinced ourselves that we have no willpower. We are weak, not strong.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 8,"<p class=""body"">Personal weaknesses so often appear on a plate. Some commentaries on the <span class=""it-text"">Al</span><span class=""it-text""> </span><span class=""it-text"">Ĥ</span><span class=""it-text"">et </span>list point to specific religious breaches connected to food. We eat without saying the appropriate blessings before and afterwards. We eat food that we shouldn’t, sneaking a taste of something prohibited for a kosher-only crowd. “I’m a bad Jew,” we might hear from someone who keeps kosher at home but loves a <span class=""sc"">BLT</span> on the road.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 9,"<p class=""body"">We can even get more talmudic and turn to a passage that suggests we are judged by the company we keep. A scholar, the Talmud recommends, should eat only with the wise, lest meals devolve into ribaldry and inappropriate trivialities, and lest others witness the scholar potentially compromising himself. On a similar note, <span class=""it-text"">Ethics of the Fathers</span> advises that every meal involving three people be accompanied by a teaching moment to sanctify the food, a <span class=""it-text"">dvar Torah</span>. We may confess on Yom Kippur for failing to make an ordinary meal into a time of shared study; we rushed a Shabbat meal to get a nap and did not sanctify that meal by sharing Torah. For that we confess.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 10,"<p class=""body"">And yet, despite all of the potential spiritual infractions possibly hinted at in this confession, there is another larger and looming question: am I eating and drinking the way that I should, the way that optimizes my health and minimizes any addictions or bad habits born of years of socialized behavior? We adopt food-related behaviors very early and may spend a lifetime fighting them or resigning ourselves to them but never quite relinquishing the residual emotional impact that this tension presents. Food is rarely an emotionally neutral subject, and when we speak about it in a prayer for self-improvement we understand that it is part of a larger conversation about self-discipline and achieving objectives incrementally, objectives that must be secured and maintained day after day after day.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 11,"<p class=""body"">We are what we eat. We are how we eat. We are the way we manage everyday behavior that can easily spiral out of control, breaking the biblical prohibition: “But take utmost care and watch yourselves scrupulously” (Deuteronomy 4:9). We are commanded by God to take the utmost care of the body that houses the soul. Maimonides writes that when the body suffers, the soul cannot achieve its great heights. Sickness is consumptive; it eats time and distracts us from focusing on other matters. Our faith demands that health must be of supreme personal concern, and one of the markers of good health is food consumption or restraint.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 12,"<p class=""body"">It is easy enough to imagine cases of transgression that seem deserving of a confession. It’s the obese young man with the growing waistline who tells his doctor he is dieting but is secretly hiding stashes of junk food all around the house. It’s the thin high school senior battling anorexia who looks in the mirror and sees someone ugly and heavy before her. It’s the middle-aged woman in a failing marriage who has a drinking problem, but denies it to her friends and children who desperately want her to get help. It’s the grandfather with diabetes who keeps plying his grandchildren with candy and always orders cake in restaurants.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 13,"<p class=""body"">But why only look at the extreme cases when ordinary living poses so many daily food challenges? Betraying the simple goals we set for ourselves that keep us in good health is also worthy of a few lines of reflection once a year, so we say the confession along with everyone else. I keep Philo of Alexandria’s quote in my wallet: “Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.” Great is in the eye of the beholder.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 14,"<p class=""body""><span class=""it-text"">New York Times</span> restaurant critic Frank Bruni wrote a memoir of his lifelong struggle with food, <span class=""it-text"">Born Round: The Secret History of a Full-Time Eate</span><span class=""_80-italic"">r</span>. The picture on the book’s back cover shows a svelte journalist who seems, on the surface, to be winning the battle. In this memoir he talks about his own food lies, the lies he told himself about his metabolism and habits and the lies he told others about what he was eating and drinking. This surfaced for him in a particularly ironic way when he was asked to transition from political correspondent to restaurant critic, which meant getting paid to eat. He describes the insanity of the decision to plunge into a world of constant eating when he had struggled with his weight constantly. Bruni finally concludes that what had changed most about him when his weight was under control “wasn’t determination. It was honesty.” He stopped lying to himself about the damage food could and did do and knew that his body was speaking to him with all the warning signs. He just chose to ignore them. “The care and the candor are the challenge,” he says, and “one botched day or even one botched week wasn’t apocalyptic. It was life as most people lived it<span class=""no-break""> –</span> certainly as I did.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Frank Bruni, Born Round: The Secret History of a Full-Time Eater (New York: Penguin Press, 2009), 248.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Three: Discipline 15,"<p class=""body"">The tug-of-war of food and self-discipline begins early in Jewish texts. We find an odd swath of talmudic discourse in chapter eight of Yoma, which focuses on repentance, specifically on Yom Kippur and its prohibitions. Because we are fasting, we often think about food and our relationship to it even more than usual. Into these debates enters a disquisition on repentance and the biblical transitional food of our wilderness trek to the Promised Land: manna. Manna was a strange food, introduced in Exodus 16 when the Israelites were starving and protested that Moses and Aaron had not made sufficient accommodation for their hunger in the desert. God gave them food, but it was not at all what they had in mind:</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 16,"<p class=""extract-first"">In the morning there was a fall of dew about the camp. When the fall of dew lifted, there, over the surface of the wilderness, lay a fine and flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground. When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?”<span class=""no-break""> –</span> for they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat.” (Exodus 16:13–15)</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 17,"<p class=""body-first"">Manna is actually named for the experience of confusion, shifting the language slightly from <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">Man hu</span>?”<span class=""no-break""> –</span> what is it?<span class=""no-break""> –</span> to manna. They named the food after a question. This was faith food<span class=""no-break"">,</span> soul food<span class=""no-break"">,</span> and they had no prior acquaintance with it. But for the next forty years, until the early chapters of Joshua, this was virtually the only food they would know. When they entered the land, the day after they offered the Passover sacrifice, the manna stopped its heavenly descent: “On that same day, when they ate of the produce of the land, the manna ceased. The Israelites got no more manna; that year they ate of the yield of the land of Canaan” (Joshua 5:12).</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 18,"<p class=""body"">The manna was designed as a spiritual food to test the Israelites’ faith. This was stated from the outset: “I will rain down bread for you from the sky, and the people shall go out and gather each day that day’s portion<span class=""no-break""> –</span><span class=""it-text""> that I may test them, to see whether</span><span class=""it-text""> they will follow My instructions or not</span>” (Exodus 16:4). Food can become a test in a Pavlovian sense. If you observe certain conditions, then you will receive your due. But it seems that God had something different in mind because the food itself was special; it was divinely produced and distributed. The fact that God created an essentially different food for the journey puzzled the rabbis of the Talmud, who waxed eloquently on the manna’s properties specifically as a food of repentance. It not only fueled the Israelites physically, it strengthened them internally, to help them transition out of their slavish dependence on masters for sustenance and accustom themselves to One Master who provided for them but also forced them to partner in food gathering and preparation. Helping the Israelites adjust to an autonomous lifestyle in a homeland would require an inherent shift of behavior and attitude. The manna was there as a faith tool.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 19,"<p class=""body"">The manna was round and white and was delivered on dew throughout the camp: “The people would go about and gather it, grind it between millstones or pound it in a mortar, boil it in a pot, and make it into cakes” (Numbers 11:8). The sages analyzed manna’s penitential properties through verses like this and used playful word dissections to discover what about it promoted faith. They concluded that manna was white because “it makes white [cleanses] the sins of Israel.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Berakhot 75a.&lt;/i&gt;</span> It had the capacity to make people vulnerable and open, revealing truths that might otherwise have been hidden. One sage wondered why the manna was delivered daily and not annually, answering that the daily distribution stimulated the Israelites to consider every day whether they were worthy of divine food. An annual gift would not have secured this kind of instant and constant attentiveness to their relationship with God or to their own behavior: “Thus they were found to turn their attention to their Father in heaven.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 76a.&lt;/i&gt;</span> The various verbs suggesting different ways the manna was distributed and cooked were understood by the sages as a public statement of goodness. If you were righteous, the manna was delivered to your tent door already in the form of bread. If you were wicked, you had to travel to get it and then pound it with a mortar to make it into flour. If you were neither righteous nor wicked, the manna had to be gathered but was not far away and appeared as cakes. Manna was the food of faith because the food was a visible, public witness to your behavior. It stood in judgment of your deeds through its daily delivery.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 20,"<p class=""body"">The Israelites were mid-trek when they struggled mightily with temptation and suffered food fatigue. They were tired of the manna and its blandness: “Now our gullets are shriveled. There is nothing at all! Nothing but this manna to look at!” (Numbers 11:6). One medieval exegete described their gullets as dry and parched as a result of this heaven-sent bread.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;See the comments of Rashbam, Rabbi Samuel ben Meir, on this verse.&lt;/i&gt;</span> In other words, they lost sight of its heavenly properties and only experienced its limitations. They were desperate for meat and wanted to know if this God of theirs could provide them with the near impossible in the wilderness: a glut of meat. The text proceeds to tell us with visual insight what the Israelites suddenly experienced in response to their food cravings, rich in sensual detail:</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 21,"<p class=""extract-first"">A wind from the Lord started up, swept quail from the sea and strewed them over the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and about a day’s journey on that side, and some two cubits deep on the ground. The people set to gathering quail all day and night and all the next day…and they spread them out all around the camp. The meat was still between their teeth, nor yet chewed, when the anger of the Lord blazed forth against the people and the Lord struck the people with a very severe plague. That place was named Kibroth-hattaava because the people who had the craving were buried there. (Numbers 11:31–34)</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 22,"<p class=""body-first"">Unlike the manna that was delivered on divine dew at a set time, the text emphasizes the collapse of time. The people in their greed ate day and night, without restraint. They saw meat everywhere they looked, piled high and dense. They traveled a day’s journey to get it, and when they saw it, they ravaged the quail flesh. The image of a plague striking them while the meat was still between their teeth, not yet chewed into food but stuffed into their formerly parched gullets, is graphic and revolting. We have little sympathy for these whining, excessive Israelites whose taste buds were more important than God’s larger vision, which required patience and discipline. The place name given for this incident literally means “graves of desire.” Desire can become a tombstone, a marker of everything that we fail to do to preserve our best instincts and desires.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 23,"<p class=""body"">Today, we know more about willpower and its limitations than we ever have. Psychologist Roy Baumeister and journalist John Tierney, in their book <span class=""it-text"">Willpowe</span><span class=""_80-italic"">r</span>, state the belief that willpower alone is our greatest human strength.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Roy Baumeister and John Tierney, Willpower (New York: Penguin, 2011); see also Kelly McGonigal, The Willpower Instinct (New York: Avery, 2011).&lt;/i&gt;</span> In an earlier book by Baumeister, he and his co-authors concluded that “self-regulation failure is the major social pathology of our time,” relating it to increases in crime, divorce, and domestic violence.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;See Roy Baumeister, Dianne Tice, and Todd Heatherton, Losing Control (San Diego: Academic Press, 1994).&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Three: Discipline 24,"<p class=""body"">At the same time, Baumeister believes, willpower needs resistance training. You can develop more willpower if you use your willpower. The downside is that, like a muscle, willpower also gets depleted with fatigue and overuse. Kelly McGonigal, in <span class=""it-text"">The Willpower Instinct</span>, believes that willpower is not a mind-over-body response but an actual biological function that is adaptive with proper nurturing. Too much self-control can have negative effects, just as temptation and stress can place an unnecessary burden on the willpower muscle. Practice helps us make progress. In fact, Tierney praises observant religious people, believing that they are a good example of how self-discipline shapes character and builds self-control.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 25,"<p class=""body"">In a radio interview, Tierney said, “Just putting food where you can see it next to you depletes your willpower. Whereas putting it away in a drawer or putting it across the room makes it easier for you because you’re not actively resisting the temptation.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;See National Public Radio, “Resistance Training for Your ‘Willpower’ Muscles,” http://www.npr.org/2011/09/18/140516974/resistance-training-for-your-willpower-muscles.&lt;/i&gt;</span> Tierney also warned about being careful with willpower since one has only a finite amount of it: “conserve it and try to save it for the emergencies.”</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 26,"<p class=""body"">Psychological tests done on students have borne this out. Those who resisted the temptation to eat cookies, for example, did more poorly on tests later in the day since they required more self-discipline overall. Holding back desire for a significant period of time can result in a binge release. The message: pick what you need to be disciplined about because it is impossible to have the mental strength to overcome all desire. Researchers refer to usage of finite willpower as “ego depletion.” In fact, McGonigal believes that when our discipline fails and we beat ourselves up over it with guilt and shame, we may be lessening the chances for willpower to kick in in the future. Those with self-<span class=""no-break"">compassion</span> and self-forgiveness generally also have the best self-control.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 27,"<p class=""body"">McGonigal argues that often when it comes to thinking about and changing ourselves, there is a disconnect between our current behavior and attitudes and the way that we imagine ourselves to be in some unknown future. In that future, we imagine that we will behave differently than we do now. We will be nicer, slimmer, more generous, and more carefree. Perhaps our future Jewish selves will learn more, give more <span class=""it-text"">tzedaka</span>,<span class=""it-text""> </span>and pray with more consistency and intention. But McGonigal believes that it is much more likely that the future looks a lot like our present when it comes to the self. Psychological tests reveal that when people saw digitally age-enhanced versions of themselves and then were given a thousand dollars, they allocated double the money to their retirement fund. Students who were given a choice of volunteering this semester or next were willing to give twenty-seven minutes to doing good this semester; those signing up the for the following semester volunteered eighty-five minutes. When asked to volunteer others, students signed up peers for 120 minutes.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;See the work of psychology professor Emily Pronin of Princeton University as cited in Alina Tugend, “Bad Habits? My Future Self Will Deal with That,” New York Times, February 25, 2012, B5.&lt;/i&gt;</span> We demand more of our future selves and others than we demand of ourselves now. Why? Because we envision that we will be better tomorrow than we are today.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 28,"<p class=""body"">But a wish is not the same thing as the kind of behavior management that would brush away our doubts and actually set us on a real course for improvement in the days ahead. Every Yom Kippur we imagine a tomorrow filled with piety, until we actually get there and discover that too often, without a plan in place, the week after Yom Kippur looks a lot like the week before it.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 29,"<p class=""body"">And even though they say that bad habits are hard to break, Charles Duhigg, in his recent book, <span class=""it-text"">The Power of Habit</span>, argues that the more we know about how we form our habits, the easier they are to change. He amasses scientific evidence to show that difficult tasks repeated multiple times become rote. We may barely think about what we do when we shoot a basket, drive a car, or take a shower because we go into automatic pilot. We’ve done things so many times that our bodies engage even if our minds are coasting. David Brooks, writing on Duhigg, claims that “your willpower is not like a dam that can block the torrent of self-indulgence. It’s more like a muscle, which tires easily.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;David Brooks, “The Machiavellian Impulse,” New York Times, March 1, 2012, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/opinion/brooks-the-machiavellian-temptation.html?_r=1.&lt;/i&gt;</span> It needs to be fortified.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 30,"<p class=""body"">If repetition is the key to habit, then recalibrating behaviors and performing them differently, again and again, becomes one critical way that we break bad habits and willfully choose new ones. When we learn new routines and practice them repeatedly, we “teach” ourselves to adopt the best practices. It is awkward at first but still doable. Research conducted at Duke University shows that 40 percent of our behaviors are formed through habit rather than intentional decisions. With a little concerted mental effort, we can reshape old habits.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;See Charles Duhigg, The Power of Habit (New York: Random House, 2012) and a review of it, “Can’t Help Myself,” by Timothy D. Wilson, New York Times Book Review, March 11, 2012, 15.&lt;/i&gt;</span> We can train ourselves to follow new habits to the extent that they become a permanent fixture of the way we operate in any given realm, repeating new behaviors until they have the ease of old habits. Habits are like friends; it takes a long time to make a new friend an old friend. It is common to underestimate how long the integration of these new habits will take.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 31,"<p class=""body"">The research on willpower corresponds with much of what we read in <span class=""it-text"">Musar</span> literature, ethical works largely developed in nineteenth-century Eastern and Western Europe to aid in spiritual growth and self-improvement. The world of <span class=""it-text"">Musar</span> presents the forces of good and evil<span class=""no-break""> –</span> <span class=""it-text"">yetzer hatov</span> and <span class=""it-text"">yetzer hara</span><span class=""no-break""> –</span> in constant battle with each other. We are the battlefield where the fighting takes place. Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler (1892–1953), in one of the most important works of <span class=""it-text"">Musar</span>, <span class=""it-text"">Strive </span><span class=""it-text"">for Truth</span>, makes the battlefield a place of small victories and large obstacles.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 32,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Dessler was the scion of a rabbinic family and the founder of the Gateshead Yeshiva in the north of England. In 1947, he moved to Bnei Brak to learn and teach in Israel. Notes taken by his students during his lectures formed the basis of <span class=""it-text"">Strive</span><span class=""it-text""> for Truth</span>, a book prepared by one of his disciples, Aryeh Carmell. One of Rabbi Dessler’s most noted contributions to the world of Jewish self-improvement lies in his observations on the <span class=""it-text"">beĥira</span> point.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler, Strive for Truth, trans. Aryeh Carmell (Jerusalem: Feldheim Publishers, 2004); see parts 1–4 in the three-volume set. The beĥira point appears throughout Rabbi Dessler’s book and in collected sermons.&lt;/i&gt;</span> <span class=""it-text"">Beĥira </span>is the Hebrew term for “choice,” but specifically refers to choices made of one’s free will. Rabbi Dessler compared our moral choices to life on the battlefield. He writes, “When two armies are locked in battle, fighting takes place only at the battlefront.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 52.&lt;/i&gt;</span> Any territory behind the lines of either army is assumed to be in the possession of that army. If one army pushes the other back, then that territory, too, becomes the assumed possession of that particular army. He compares this notion of the point where the troops meet to choices that individuals make:</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 33,"<p class=""extract-first"">The situation is very similar with regard to <span class=""it-text"">be</span><span class=""it-text"">ĥ</span><span class=""it-text"">ira</span>. Everyone has free choice<span class=""no-break""> –</span> at the point where truth meets falsehood. In other words, <span class=""it-text"">beĥira</span> takes place at the point where the truth as the person sees it confronts the illusion produced in him by the power of falsehood. But the majority of a person’s actions are undertaken without any clash between truth and falsehood taking place.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 53.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Three: Discipline 34,"<p class=""body-first"">Most decisions we make, Rabbi Dessler argues, are not a struggle for us. We may have been raised with certain values that operate within us naturally. For example, a person raised within a framework of <span class=""it-text"">kashrut</span> observance will not think twice about whether or not to eat something non-kosher, thus the popular salami diet. A person who keeps kosher may fight the urge for chocolate but may never fight the temptation for ham. If he pops a piece of salami in his mouth in the presence of milk chocolate, cheese cake, or a milkshake, chances are good that he will have no desire to eat dairy products (because of the lengthy separation between milk and meat for kosher-only eaters). There is no struggle for that individual; therefore, the <span class=""it-text"">beĥira </span>point is not activated. In addition, Rabbi Dessler believes that “any behavior a person adopts as a result of training or by copying others is not counted as his own,”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 60.&lt;/i&gt;</span> since this is not his own battlefield. He cannot praise himself for not eating ham. He can only praise himself for exercising discipline to overcome a challenge that he actually has. In Rabbi Dessler’s words, <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">Beĥira</span> comes into play only when one is tempted to go against the truth as one sees it and the forces on either side are more or less equally balanced.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 54.&lt;/i&gt;</span> We want to move from desire to clarity. “The ultimate aim of all of our service is to graduate from freedom to compulsion. We do not want to remain in that confused state in which ‘truth’ and ‘falsehood’ seem equally valid alternatives.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 62.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Three: Discipline 35,"<p class=""body"">The moral battlefield is one that we create and one that we largely control. While we cannot control what we are up against, we do control how we respond to it. When we battle the forces against us and make good choices, we can get to the point that Rabbi Dessler calls compulsion. We feel utterly compelled to make good decisions; we have so profoundly integrated good choices that it would not occur to us to make poor ones. Thus, we have changed the battlefield. In order to change it, we have to spend time discovering our <span class=""it-text"">beĥira</span> point.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 36,"<p class=""body"">Imagine a person who battles every day with a weight problem. Every time he or she takes food, the battle rages within. After extensive dieting and overcoming recurring health problems, this individual no longer faces the same battlefield because he or she has integrated more healthful eating habits. Rabbi Dessler calls this “higher unfreedom.”</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 37,"<p class=""body"">There is an even higher level on the battleground. Compulsion is still an active force, a decision, even if it is a decision for good. At a certain point of commitment, individuals do good for the sake of goodness; there is no compulsion at all. Doing right is simply natural. “Compulsion applies only where there is resistance. One cannot speak of compulsion to do something one loves.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 62–63.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Three: Discipline 38,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Dessler helps us consider the humanity of the moral struggle and our place within it. The point of choice on a battleground is the place where equally compelling forces are pulling us in different directions and where an active choice is required. The more our capacity to do good becomes instinctive, the more able we are to move the lines on the battlefield so that we possess more moral territory. For those who are able with constancy and regularity to conquer the forces working against them through active choice, freedom turns into compulsion. That compulsion turns into love. At that point, the individual has achieved Rabbi Dessler’s goal: “The man of the spirit is the truly liberated man.”</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 39,"<p class=""body"">A liberated person is one who engages his or her self-control at will. Self-control is the ultimate strength. We can fight the battle within and win. The past is not something we can control. But with our own willpower in place, we can redeem it in the future.</p>"
Day Three: Discipline 40,"<p class=""body"">Sadly, we cannot change past failures. Looking back on a stained history, we wonder what would have happened had Ishmael not murdered Gedalia and others on that fateful day. What would have happened had Ishmael had more self-control? We may have rebuilt our community in Israel out of the ashes of destruction, as we have done successfully so many times since. But we will never know. Weakness prevailed. We can only defeat it looking forward and redeem gratuitous hatred with overpowering love.</p>"

Day Four: Humility 2,"<p class=""chapter-first""><span class=""First-Letter"">T</span><span class=""optical"">he </span>word humility is rooted in the Latin word for “grounded” or “low,” from the word “humus” or earth. To be a person of the earth is to realize that one is small. We come from the earth and will return to it, in Job’s immortal words; while we occupy it, we should take up a smaller spiritual footprint to make space for others. To be humble is to think modestly of one’s abilities and one’s place in the world. Being humble also means that we have the emotional bandwidth to make others feel good about themselves without believing that it detracts from our own sense of security. Humble people have the capacity to honor others. Arrogant people hoard all credit for themselves<span class=""no-break""> –</span> as if complimenting others detracts from oneself.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 3,"<p class=""body"">A young man on the rise in his company shared his distress with me. One of his close colleagues, a man in a senior position, confessed to him out of the office when his guard was down that he hated <span class=""no-break"">hearing</span> about his younger colleague’s successes. It frustrated him to no end that this rising star was sucking away attention from others, mostly from himself. He resented this man’s talent and was openly jealous. When we spoke about it, he was unsure what to do. Working hard was not enough. He had to learn to work hard and not have anyone notice, since his success was taking away from the success of his superiors.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 4,"<p class=""body"">Elie Wiesel famously said that one of the lessons he learned from receiving the Nobel Peace Prize was who his friends were. They were the people who could feel genuine happiness for his success, not begrudge him out of envy or spite. A test of true friendship and support is not only whether others empathize with our travails, but also whether they are able to rejoice in our better moments and compliment freely and sincerely. Friends celebrate the success of others, as it states in <span class=""it-text"">Ethics of the Fathers</span>, “Let your friend’s honor be as dear to you as your own” (2:10). The capacity to honor and recognize the goodness and achievement of others is a signature of personal humility and security. If it is hard to compliment others, to make others feel good, then we have to look in the mirror and ask ourselves why.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 5,"<p class=""body"">Humility is critical to the life of the spirit because it enables us to accept a subordinate position in relation to others and God. If we take up every word in a dialogue it becomes a soliloquy. If we take up all the space in a room, there is no room for God.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 6,"<p class=""body"">We stretch forth our necks in sin when we allow ourselves to sit in judgment over others. By making someone else inferior, we become more superior in our own eyes. Our necks metaphorically extend higher and then look down at others. Rabbi Luzzatto wrote about humility and arrogance throughout the pages of <span class=""it-text"">The Path of the Just</span>, understanding that this battle preoccupies us all. It is a constant fight within.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 7,"<p class=""extract-first"">Pride consists in a person’s pluming himself with his self and considering himself worthy of praise. There can be many different reasons behind this. Some deem themselves intelligent; some, handsome; some, honored; some, great; some, wise…. When a man attributes to himself any of the good things of the world, he puts himself in immediate danger of falling into the pit of pride.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rabbi Moshe Haim Luzzatto, The Path of the Just (Jerusalem: Feldheim Publishers, 1980), 155.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Four: Humility 8,"<p class=""body-first"">The pit of pride can swallow us whole.

Day Four: Humility 9,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum (1759–1841), the Rebbe of Ujhely, Hungary, and a convert to Hasidut through his son-in-law, told this story in notes he made on the dreams of his youth. It is a good example of the pit of pride we must avoid. Rabbi Teitelbaum was looking out his window on the night of Rosh HaShana and watched as a throng of people hurried to the synagogue: “I saw that they were driven by the fear of the Day of Judgment.” He watched this with an outstretched neck and said to himself: “God be thanked, I have been doing the right thing all through the year! I have studied right and prayed right, so I do not have to be afraid.” Watching the sudden rush to synagogue did not stir panic within him. His good deeds and character were all in check. Why hurry? With this confidence he examined his dreams to review all his good works. “I looked and looked: They were torn, ragged, ruined! At that instant I woke up. Overcome with fear, I ran to the House of Prayer along with the rest.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Martin Buber, Tales of the Hasidim: Later Masters (New York: Schocken Books, 1977), 189.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Four: Humility 10,"<p class=""body"">We recognize Rabbi Moshe’s stability. It is the posture of an overconfident man entering the Day of Judgment. We have all been there. Rosh HaShana catches us by surprise. We are blessedly unprepared. We feel good about ourselves. And why shouldn’t we? But then we pause to think more deeply about the year past and our regrets and mistakes, and suddenly we are overcome with Rabbi Moshe’s panic. Humility gets the better of us. Get thee to a synagogue. Fast.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 11,"<p class=""body"">In the synagogue at this time of year, we take ourselves out of the pit of pride and throw ourselves willingly into the pit of humility. Our prayers are designed to help us acknowledge our smallness in the universe. One of the most famous of these is an evening <span class=""it-text"">piyut</span>, an acrostic poem of anonymous authorship, sung during <span class=""it-text"">Kol Nidrei</span>:</p>"

Day Four: Humility 24,"<p class=""body-first"">The request for forgiveness stays the same, but the way we refer to ourselves and to God changes. We review the different ways that God relates to us with mercy and authority, giving us life and sustaining us, as would a craftsman. We are mere raw material. Any ingredient of uniqueness we may possess<span class=""no-break""> –</span> our health, our wealth, good looks, or a good mind<span class=""no-break""> –</span> is God’s doing and in God’s hands to mold. It has little to do with us.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 25,"<p class=""body"">But even as we raise our voices in song and lower our impulse of pride, we know the synagogue is also no safe place to escape the ego, especially during the Days of Awe. People are interested in ladies’ hats and suits and expensive jewelry. People are interested in who sits in what row. People are interested in others who sway and bow, the piety of those they observe in their peripheral vision. People are interested in the food served in various homes at festive meals after services. The fear and reverence that should comprise our awe is often compromised by our curiosity over the material or perceived spiritual excesses in our midst.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 26,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Joseph Telushkin tells a story of his grandfather, also a rabbi. His grandfather served in the rabbinate for sixty years and told his grandson about a certain wealthy man in his congregation who was entitled to sit in a prime seat in the front of the congregation. He, instead, chose to sit in the back, watching others enter the sanctuary to see if they would notice that he was not sitting in the front. The elder Rabbi Telushkin finally confronted the wealthy man: “It would be better if you sat up front, and thought you should be seated in the back, rather than to sit in the back, and think the whole time you should be seated in the front.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Joseph Telushkin, Jewish Wisdom (New York: William Morrow, 1994), 226.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Four: Humility 27,"<p class=""body"">Sometimes we inherit the success of others, which we deem a cause for superiority: status, family wealth, or position in the community. Sometimes we work really hard to achieve material or academic success, and it happens, bloating us with pride. The sages of the Talmud pondered the question of why many Torah scholars have children who are not Torah scholars. Many of their answers have to do with arrogance. A scholar who regards himself as superior to others might make a child question whether religion matters. The child then opts out of religion.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;See Nedarim 81a.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Four: Humility 28,"<p class=""body"">Even in the arena of Torah study, a cardinal value of Jewish life, scholarship is riddled with battles for status. This problem was addressed outright in <span class=""it-text"">Ethics of the Fathers</span>: “Do not give yourself airs if you have learned much Torah, because it is for this purpose you were created” (2:8). We are entitled to feel joy when we have discovered and are living our life’s purpose, but joy is not the same as superiority. Superiority only brings down the spirit and ruins the reputation of the mind as a tool for meaning. It too often becomes a tool for status, even<span class=""no-break""> –</span> and some could argue especially<span class=""no-break""> –</span> among Torah scholars.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 29,"<p class=""body"">There is little in the world more insufferable than self-<span class=""no-break"">righteousness</span>. Those who suffer from it believe that God is on their side, supporting the piety of the observant against the ignorance of those who are not. Self-righteousness lies at the very heart of the fundamentalist, making him police officer, judge, and prosecutor. In contrast, God makes a small request through the agency of the prophet. “Act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God” (Micah 6:8). Micah asks this of us as if it were easy and imposed no great burden. Yet the burden of humility is the very fact that we have to remind ourselves of it always.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 30,"<p class=""body"">Humility can be a result of the way we were raised, a character trait we come by easily<span class=""no-break""> –</span> or it may have been conditioned by a change of circumstances. Tragic experiences often take a person from a place of pride to a place of humility. The person who stretches forth his neck above others becomes the very same person who sits with his head bowed because life suddenly took an unexpected turn for the worse. When all is well, we give ourselves extra credit, believing that we are worthy of all of our successes. But when a change of fortune sets in, it is not only that we lose something concrete<span class=""no-break""> –</span> like a spouse or a job or our savings<span class=""no-break""> –</span> but we also lose a self-image consonant with success. The captain-of-the-universe posture rusts into a confusing, beguiling, and disappointing mess.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 31,"<p class=""body"">Just ask Job. There is no better story to illustrate this than the spiritual whiplash suffered by Job. Job had everything: a large family, wealth, and status born of his wisdom. And then Job became the unwitting victim in a wager between God and Satan: God believed that a faithful servant would be loyal in any circumstance; Satan believed that only those who are blessed stay true to God. God pointed to the person He deemed most successful in the ancient Near East: Job of the land of Uz. Job is introduced as a man who was “blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil” (Job 1:1). He had ten children<span class=""no-break""> –</span> seven of whom were boys, a sure sign of blessing in the days of old<span class=""no-break""> –</span> and a vast estate. “The man was wealthier than anyone in the East” (1:3). But by the end of the first chapter, Job had lost all of his children, and his world quickly unraveled.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 32,"<p class=""body"">Later in the story, Job reflects on the man he had once been in his prime: “O that I were as in months gone by, in the days when God watched over me, when His lamp shone over my head, when I walked in the dark by His light” (29:2). At that time, Job says, his children surrounded him and his feet “were bathed in cream” (29:6). He had the attention of nobles; young men hid from him out of fear. He helped others who were unfortunate; men would listen for his words of wisdom. He describes his words as drops of dew to men who were thirsty for his counsel. But after calamity struck, he walked in the streets ashamed and denigrated, a man of little worth among friends.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 33,"<p class=""body"">It must have felt good to be regarded so highly, to walk into a room and have people hang on your every word and enjoy “love like a king among his troops, like one who consoles mourners” (29:25). The one who consoles mourners extends pity to others; he never imagines himself as an object of pity to others.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 34,"<p class=""body"">In the very first chapters that follow his catalogue of woes, Job begins to understand his altered position and curses his very existence: “Perish the day on which I was born and the night it was announced…. May that day be darkness. May God have no concern for it. May light not shine upon it” (3:4–5). Job never curses God; he only wonders at why he was ever brought into existence. The worst tragedy that could befall him struck. The nightmare of all nightmares was real:</p>"

Day Four: Humility 40,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">And trouble came. (3:24–26)</p>"
Day Four: Humility 41,"<p class=""body-first"">A man of prominence stops eating. A mouth that once could afford any delicacy is filled with groaning. His most dreaded fears have come true, leaving him without any respite. And what happens in the over forty chapters that follow is the total transformation of a man of success into a brittle version of his former self. His faith stays constant, but his pride is replaced with despondency.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 42,"<p class=""body"">The secret of Job’s humility was no secret at all. As his life shrunk in its capacity for blessing, Job questioned all of the assumptions that lead to success, particularly the belief in human mastery. The mortal hubris of achievement was crushed in a single blow, leaving Job winded.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 43,"<p class=""body"">As the book nears its end, God speaks directly to Job, asking Job if he has an inkling of understanding of how the world works. God moves Job’s ruminations from self-pity by asking him to contemplate the complexity of a world far beyond his comprehension:</p>"
Day Four: Humility 44,"<p class=""extract-first"">Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundations?</p>"
Day Four: Humility 45,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">Speak if you have understanding.</p>"

Day Four: Humility 51,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">And all the divine beings shouted for joy? (38:4–7)</p>"
Day Four: Humility 52,"<p class=""body-first"">God, the divine structural engineer, questions Job about the foundations of the universe and who set it all in motion. As if Job’s tragedies had not humbled him sufficiently, God in the next several chapters continues to question Job about seemingly every facet of the world: lightning, the ocean, clouds, snow, constellations, the hunting instinct of the lion, the season when mountain goats give birth, the way an ostrich beats its wings, the way the eagle soars. All of nature is governed by a force so vast that no person, however wise, can conceive of it all. We read Job and are reminded of the poem “Design,” in which Robert Frost meditates on “a dimpled spider, fat and white.” He looks at it closely and marvels at its intricacies and its capacity to frighten human beings:</p>"
Day Four: Humility 53,"<p class=""extract-first"">What but design of darkness to appall?–</p>"
Day Four: Humility 54,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">If design govern in a thing so small.</p>"
Day Four: Humility 55,"<p class=""body-first"">God asks Job if he can possibly understand the natural world, the design of each creature and its relationship to the ecosystem that God manufactured. To this, Job can muster only silence and a weak response, the response of humility:</p>"
Day Four: Humility 56,"<p class=""extract-first"">See, I am of small worth. What can I answer You? I clap my hands to my mouth. (40:4)</p>"
Day Four: Humility 57,"<p class=""body-first"">We, too, are small in God’s immense universe. Practice humility. Making ourselves smaller helps us appreciate the vastness of a world so much larger than we are.</p>"

Day Five: Compassion 1,"<p class=""_8-Quotation--prelims-at-top-of-page-"">“We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your redeeming laws, and we have gained nothing from it.”</p>"
Day Five: Compassion 2,"<p class=""chapter-first""><span class=""First-Letter"">J</span><span class=""optical"">onah </span>has been depicted in ancient floor mosaics and on the ceiling <br/>       of the Sistine Chapel. He is a figure of interest in the three major Western faiths, and scholars have been piqued for centuries by this strange aquatic tale. The book bearing his name is one of the shortest in the Bible, and the only one that ends with a question. Its pages depict the defiance of a prophet, Jonah’s resignation to accept a mission, and his eventual failure to carry through the task. In Christian polemics, Jonah is regarded as a disturbed Hebrew prophet who pales in religious commitment to the sailors and citizens of Nineveh, all of whom seem more contrite than one of God’s anointed. It is reported in a Hadith that Muhammad once said, “One should not say that I am better than Jonah, son of Amitai.”</p>"
Day Five: Compassion 3,"<p class=""body"">This negativity shows a lack of insight into the true struggle in the book: the battle between justice and compassion. On one level, Jonah turns away from God’s command, gains nothing, and loses everything, just like the confession we read every Yom Kippur: “We have turned away from Your commandments and from Your redeeming laws and we have gained nothing from it.” Virtually all of the sins that follow are a result of a deeper chasm; we have turned away from God and our lives begin to fall apart. But on another level, Jonah runs away because, in his stark and rigid view of good and evil, he has little room for compassion for others but demands it for himself. His is a struggle that the prophet and God wage that also rages within us all.</p>"
Day Five: Compassion 4,"<p class=""body"">The book of Jonah throws the reader immediately into the prophet’s call and his resistance. The word of God comes to Jonah, who is told to rise and go to an ancient city first mentioned early in Genesis (10:12). The story does away with the usual genealogical background because we have met Jonah earlier, in <span class=""sc"">ii</span> Kings. There Jonah is mentioned as a prophet under King Jeroboam <span class=""sc"">iI</span> of Samaria, a ruler who, we are told explicitly, did not depart from the sins of his ancestors. In the eighth century before the Common Era, Jonah’s singular contribution to the reign of Jeroboam was to help the king recover territory lost to Israel: “It was he who restored the territory of Israel from Lebo-hamath to the sea of the Araba, in accordance with the promise that the Lord made through His servant, the prophet Jonah, son of Amitai, from Gath-hepher. For the Lord saw the plight of Israel, with neither bond nor free left and none to help Israel” (<span class=""sc"">ii</span> Kings 14:25). God here is depicted as a compassionate ruler who helped Israel when its people lacked all other advocates. The prophet worked within the political confines of his day as an agent of God’s mission.</p>"
Day Five: Compassion 5,"<p class=""body"">Gath-hepher, Jonah’s hometown, is near the city of Nazareth today, which explains why Jonah had to go down to Jaffa onto a ship: Jaffa was located to the south of his hometown. This passage may also help us understand Jonah’s hesitation. Thus far, Jonah had been involved solely with strengthening and recovering the boundaries of Israel at a time of Israelite vulnerability. To task him with going to an enemy nation<span class=""no-break""> –</span> one that had turned on the Jews time and again<span class=""no-break""> –</span> in order to strengthen them morally could only undermine responsibilities he fulfilled in his past. Jonah was figuratively at sea and would soon be literally there as well.</p>"
Day Five: Compassion 6,"<p class=""body"">Jonah’s descent into Jaffa and then into the boat presages the deeper descent that he experienced; he also went down into the recesses of the ship and then down into a deep sleep. The Hebrew root y-r-d (“descend” or “go down”) is repeated as the prophet sinks lower and lower into what today might be categorized as depression. He lacked even the most basic instinct of self-preservation, as he fell into what is nearly a comatose state while the ship was at breaking point. The captain was so intrigued by Jonah’s behavior that he left his urgent responsibilities to wake the sleeping prophet with the question that rings in the ears of every penitent this season: “How can you be sleeping so soundly?” (Jonah 1:6). Many commentators see the ship’s captain as the ultimate metaphor for God Himself. The captain gave Jonah the same command as God did earlier: Get up!</p>"
Day Five: Compassion 7,"<p class=""body"">But Jonah was not able to rise to the occasion or help the sailors save themselves and the ship. His compassion for them was masked by his self-absorption. He had no room for pity, only self-pity. Instead, Jonah gave them enigmatic answers to very clear questions. Earlier, when asked what he did, he could not offer a straight answer. He said, “I am a Hebrew. I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made both sea and dry land” (1:9). This is hardly a job description. The only directive he was able to muster was the command that they throw him overboard. This is the ultimate statement of passivity, not even taking responsibility for one’s own death. At a time when the sailors were focused on salvation, he asked them to be murderers, rather than just jumping overboard himself. They pressed their oars harder into the sea but to no avail. The tempest heightened in scale and intensity, and with a plea that God forgive them for any transgression of innocent blood spilled, they threw this odd man into the sea. When the sea ceased raging, the sailors offered sacrifices to Jonah’s God, fearing Him in a way that Jonah did not. The chapter ends with their vows to God, an odd bookend to Jonah, who never paid his pledge and was now edging towards the bottom of the sea.</p>"
Day Five: Compassion 8,"<p class=""body"">The contrast could not be greater. The sailors became a niggling foil for Jonah’s recidivism. Later, the citizens of Nineveh would serve the same purpose, prompting ancient Christian scholars to take the critical view of this ancient prophet, arguing that it shows the fault lines of Jewish leadership.</p>"
Day Five: Compassion 9,"<p class=""body"">The complexity of Jonah’s inner battle is exquisitely captured in an engraving by French artist Gustav Doré (1832–1883). In the engraving, Jonah looks back in horror as he grips a scrim of dry land, the shore’s edge of Nineveh, while the great leviathan of the sea turns to make its way back to the heart of the ocean.</p>"

Day Six: Gratitude 3,"<p class=""body"">Yet as we travel through the rest of the day and face the prosaic cares it spews forth, we understand that rather than set the tone for the day, <span class=""it-text"">Modeh Ani</span> can feel like a momentary aberration. A day full of gratitude seems increasingly unlikely. We said thank you once and first but may hear and say it less as the hours pass.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 4,"<p class=""body"">Most people fail to get the recognition they deserve for the work they do or for the small kindnesses they attempt. We even find ourselves saying, “no good deed goes unpunished” a little too often. Not only will goodness not be acknowledged, it may bring some trouble in its wake. The first time I heard this expression as an adult, I thought it was a mistake. Surely, good deeds go unpunished. They get rewarded. The person must have gotten it wrong. But then as some of the veneer of innocence peeled off, I came to understand that this is often a thankless world and that we must nurture ourselves because we may not get the support we need from others. Good things we do go misunderstood or undervalued. This erosion of faith in others can turn optimists into pessimists and pessimists into nihilists.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 5,"<p class=""body"">The bankruptcy of gratitude is always an enigma. Philosopher David Hume in <span class=""it-text"">A Treatise of Human Nature</span> believed that ingratitude was the ugliest of human behaviors: “Of all crimes that human creatures are capable of committing, the most horrid and unnatural is ingratitude, especially when it is committed against parents, and appears in the more flagrant instances of wounds and death.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature (New York: Oxford University Press USA, 2011), 300.&lt;/i&gt;</span> The incapacity to thank others was deemed unnatural by Hume, implying that the impulse to be grateful stems from some genuinely loving instinct that is somehow obstructed. Ingratitude towards parents was particularly problematic for Hume. Although parents get no formal training for the job and many fall short of its incredible emotional and physical demands, for Hume, at least parents bring you into the world. The appreciation we owe parents<span class=""no-break""> –</span> in some ways the human equivalent to the <span class=""it-text"">Modeh Ani</span>,<span class=""it-text""> </span>which demands gratitude before we even start the day<span class=""no-break""> –</span> is first and foremost for the fact that we could not exist without them, notwithstanding all the sacrifices that they make or made to ensure that we have life’s necessities and its many bonuses.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 6,"<p class=""body"">Hume’s implication would seem counter to what we hear many times a day. We hear people say thank you all the time. We thank people, but thanking them is not necessarily recognizing them. Hume was scratching beneath the surface of petty formalities. We often thank people because it is expected. It is part of being polite. It is on the agenda for a meeting, scripted and prepared. Sometimes the thank you is pre-written, ready to offer when the evening is over, the event is done, the exchange is completed. A full sentence was cropped to two words, then one word, and then finally one word with no vowels: thnx. Too much is missing, and it’s more than a vowel that we lack. These empty words are not spontaneous, extemporaneous, or fresh. Some thank yous feel stale and insincere.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 7,"<p class=""body"">Worse is that many thank yous are really hidden requests for something else, like acknowledgment letters from charities that are really just another solicitation. Veteran fundraiser Jerold Panas believes that donors must be thanked seven times to feel appropriately recognized.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Jerold Panas, The Fundraising Habits of Supremely Successful Boards (Medfield, MA: Emerson and Church, 2006).&lt;/i&gt;</span> Maybe people need to be thanked multiple times because they really feel they haven’t been thanked at all.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 8,"<p class=""body"">What<a id=""_idTextAnchor000""></a> explains this lack of appreciation or our incapacity to express gratitude sincerely, specifically, and robustly, especially if it is deemed unnatural to lack gratitude? Robert Solomon in <span class=""it-text"">The</span><span class=""it-text""> Psychology of Gratitude</span> ponders this very matter in his foreword to the book:</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 9,"<p class=""extract-first"">The neglect of gratitude is, in itself, interesting…. We do not like to think of ourselves as indebted. We would rather see our good fortunes as our own doing…. Like the emotion of trust, it invokes an admission of our vulnerability and our dependence on other people. Thus gratitude lies at the very heart of ethics. It is more basic, perhaps, than even duty and obligation.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Robert Solomon, “Foreword,” in The Psychology of Gratitude, ed. Robert A. Emmons and Michael E. McCullough (New York: Oxford University Press USA, 2004), v–vi.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 10,"<p class=""body-first"">We may not consciously think of gratitude as an act of vulnerability, but it is a statement of need and dependence that some may rather dismiss than admit. We hear variations of this all of the time:</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 11,"<p class=""body"">“That’s what any child should do for his parents.”</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 12,"<p class=""body"">“I don’t have to thank her. She gets a paycheck.”</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 13,"<p class=""body"">“He knows he did a good job. He doesn’t need me to tell him.”</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 14,"<p class=""body"">“I don’t want her head to get so big it can’t get through the door.”</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 15,"<p class=""body"">Really?</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 16,"<p class=""body"">This emotional stinginess is not helped by the fact that those who may have received little praise as children have decided unconsciously to pay the debt forward. “I didn’t get a thank you. Why should you?” This deficit-based way of interacting is highly flawed; it serves only to diminish others and, in so doing, diminishes our own sense of abundance and blessing.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 17,"<p class=""body"">Psychoanalyst Melanie Klein, in <span class=""it-text"">Envy and Gratitude</span>, writes that gratitude may be an admission that you are better than me. Envy, she writes, stems from a sense that love or material gain that should be given to me has been stolen by you. I cannot stand the sight of your enjoyment, only your misery, because your happiness should rightfully have been mine. Klein believes that envy is a response to profound childhood needs that went unfulfilled and are insatiable because the person who envies others “can never be satisfied because his envy comes from within and, therefore, always finds an object to focus on.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Melanie Klein, Envy and Gratitude (London: Delacorte Press, 1963), 182. I am grateful to Joanne Cohen, who introduced me to this book. &lt;/i&gt;</span> If I thank you for your advice, wisdom, energy, or friendship, I may be admitting that you have something I do not have. Because I may be mindful of your talents and abilities in relation to my own, my thank you may be a way that I confess to my own insecurities or inadequacies. I may not have enough self-confidence to acknowledge your importance in my life. “Gratitude is closely bound up with generosity,” Klein writes, stating that those who possess inner wealth can share their gifts easily with others and feel enriched as a result.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 189.&lt;/i&gt;</span> Those who lack this inner wealth may give to others but then have an exaggerated need for appreciation because of an anxiety that they have been “impoverished and robbed.” Depletion must be immediately filled.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 18,"<p class=""body"">Managing jealousy, greed, and envy<span class=""no-break""> –</span> linked emotions for Klein<span class=""no-break""> –</span> is difficult; all serve as obstacles to an attitude of gratitude. But because gratitude is so seminal to the religious life, we have to overcome our own limitations and learn how to extend it with authenticity and force. The Christian mystic Meister Eckhart (1260–1327) once wrote: “If the only prayer you said in your whole life was, ‘thank you,’ that would suffice.” Thank you <span class=""it-text"">does</span> mean that I need you or that I am vulnerable or that I cannot function without help. It means that we live in the presence of others and that life in community is inherently about dependence. Thank you is an expression of relationship. It reveals the dependence we have on each other, even if a certain toughness of spirit prevents us, at times, from acknowledging it.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 19,"<p class=""body"">This sense of dependence is rendered powerfully in a prayer recited multiple times a day in traditional circles: the <span class=""it-text"">Modim</span>, a statement of thanks that appears in the <span class=""it-text"">Amida</span> (eighteen benedictions). Repeating it creates a pause at daily intervals to bow the knee low with humility and indebtedness:</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 20,"<p class=""extract-first"">We are thankful to You that You, Adonai, are our God and the God of our fathers, forever<span class=""no-break""> –</span> Rock of our lives, Shield of our deliverance, You are in every generation. We will give thanks to You and recount Your praise, for our lives which are committed into Your hand, and for our souls which are entrusted to You, and for Your miracles of every day with us, and for Your wonders and benefactions at all times<span class=""no-break""> –</span> evening, morning, and noon. You the Beneficent One<span class=""no-break""> –</span> for Your compassion is never withheld. You are the Merciful One<span class=""no-break""> –</span> for Your kindness never ceases; we have always placed our hope in You.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 21,"<p class=""body-first"">Evening, morning, and noon the miracles keep coming, and the lives and souls that we entrust to God are renewed, as is our hope. Notice how many times the word “You” appears in the prayer, while any reference to the self never makes an appearance.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 22,"<p class=""body"">This liturgical recitation of thanks has its High Holiday parallel. The<span class=""it-text""> piyut</span>,<span class=""it-text""> </span>or acrostic poem, “<span class=""it-text"">Imru L’Elohim</span>,”<span class=""it-text""> </span>affirms the obligation to praise God for an act of creation and sustenance, coupling it in each stanza with gratitude that God is forgiving and pardons our sins. We thank God for making us and then for our capacity to remake ourselves in God’s image:</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 23,"<p class=""extract-first"">Praise God!</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 24,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">He made all things with His word,</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 25,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">And He performed and accomplished [all],</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 26,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">He pardons the nation that He carries;</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 27,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">Therefore, His people trust in Him.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 28,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">Remember the wonders He has performed.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 29,"<p class=""body-first"">We are asked to remember God’s wonders because this memory will generate more appreciation than we already feel.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 30,"<p class=""body"">Thanking God should spill over to the way that we thank human beings, but even those who pray these words with piety can scrimp when it comes to gratitude to a friend. Bahya ibn Pakuda, an eleventh-century Spanish scholar who wrote what many consider to be the first systematic work of Jewish philosophy, <span class=""it-text"">Duties of</span><span class=""it-text""> the Heart</span>,<span class=""it-text""> </span>offers a cogent explanation of this disparity.<span class=""it-text""> Duties of the Heart</span> has become a staple of <span class=""it-text"">Musar</span> literature and the yeshiva curriculum and has remained one of the chief works of ethical influence for centuries. Ibn Pakuda wrote it, he states in his introduction, because people were becoming overly concerned with the duties of the body (<span class=""it-text"">ĥ</span><span class=""it-text"">ovot</span><span class=""it-text""> ha’evarim</span>) and its many demands while ignoring the duties of the heart (<span class=""it-text"">ĥovot halevavot</span>). For ibn Pakuda, known affectionately as Bahya in most scholarly circles, thanksgiving was considered an important duty of the heart, and no Jewish heart is complete without an understanding of how interrelated belief is with gratitude. Bahya also understood that there are many utilitarian motives behind the kindnesses we extend to each other and the thanks that subsequently result:</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 31,"<p class=""extract-first"">When we consider the favors men do for each other, we find them all falling under one of five following categories: first, the favors done by parent for child; second, those done by a master for a slave; third, favors done by the wealthy for the poor, for the sake of heavenly rewards; fourth, favors done by one person for another for the sake of praise, honor, and earthly rewards; and fifth, those done by the powerful for the sake of the weak, out of pity and compassion.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Bahya ibn Pakuda, Duties of the Heart, Treatise iii, Introduction, as found in Louis Jacobs, Jewish Ethics, Philosophy and Mysticism (New York: Behrman House, 1969), 5–6.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 32,"<p class=""body-first"">In each of these relationships, there is an imbalance of power that precipitates giving. A parent gives to a child out of responsibility; a master gives to his slave out of self-interest. The noble take care of the poor out of hope to get in God’s divine graces; people are kind to one another for praise or status. Sometimes kindness emerges out of compassion. If each of these human relationships generates appreciation, Bahya observed, then all of these impulses are even truer in relation to God:</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 33,"<p class=""extract-first"">How much more then, should a person obey, praise, and thank the Creator for all benefaction and benefactors, whose beneficence is infinite, permanent and perpetual, done neither for His own benefit nor for driving away misfortunes, but His all-loving kindness and grace towards people.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 8.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 34,"<p class=""body-first"">The thank you that we give others is no match for the thank you that we owe God, who has no precipitating reason to bestow kindness upon us. It is all out of grace. If we can muster the thoughtfulness to understand this, the spillover impact is immense. If we can wrap ourselves around the fact that no one owes us kindness<span class=""no-break""> –</span> it is all beyond what we deserve<span class=""no-break""> –</span> then any kindness becomes an object worthy of acknowledgement. The physician and theologian Albert Schweitzer (1875–1965) confirms Bahya’s sentiment: “Nothing that is done for you is a matter of course. Everything originates in a will for the good, which is directed at you. Train yourself never to put off the word or action for the expression of gratitude.”</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 35,"<p class=""body"">Bahya’s understanding limns our reading of Judaism’s most famous expression of gratitude: <span class=""it-text"">Dayenu</span>, the musical centerpiece of the Haggada. Virtually every commentator on this passage observes that we would <span class=""it-text"">not</span> have thought it enough had God freed us from slavery but not given us a Torah. We would not be who we are without each stage in our historical progression, but <span class=""it-text"">Dayenu</span> forces us to pause and underline those stages, understanding their causal relationship for the whole of our identity and appreciating that had God stopped at any stage, we would never have actualized the much larger vision of our spiritual and national agenda. While we never utter the Hebrew word for thanks in the song, we do not need to because we are <span class=""it-text"">makir tov</span>, we recognize the good of the Exodus by acknowledging God’s hand in our salvation again and again:</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 36,"<p class=""extract-first"">How many kindnesses has God shown us!</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 37,"<p class=""extract-no-indent-hanging"">If He had brought us out of Egypt but did not judge the Egyptians, it would have been enough.</p>"

Day Six: Gratitude 41,"<p class=""extract-no-indent-hanging"">How much more so do we owe thanks to God for His repeated and manifold favors to us! That He brought us out of Egypt…and he gave us the Torah, and…</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 42,"<p class=""body-first"">Solomon Schimmel, in his article “Gratitude in Judaism,” comments on the unique structure of <span class=""it-text"">Dayenu</span> as a model for expressing gratitude: “When we reflect on a benefit that God [or by extension, another person] has done for us, we should break it into its multiple components, meditating on each element.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Solomon Schimmel, “Gratitude in Judaism,” in The Psychology of Gratitude, ed. Robert A. Emmons and Michael E. McCullough (New York: Oxford University Press USA, 2004), 40.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 43,"<p class=""body"">Can we say a better thank you?<span class=""it-text""> Dayenu</span> tells us we can and that we must. When we sing the praises of others generously and specifically, we do more than offer them a gift. We open up our own world of plenitude, revealing to ourselves the great fortune that is ours, even amidst hardship. As contemporary writer Melodie Beattie observes: “Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more.” <span class=""it-text"">Dayenu</span>.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 44,"<p class=""body"">A thank you is most impactful when it identifies aspects of the recipient’s help or participation that are not obvious. Appreciation affects us most when we expect it least. In classes on the subject, I often ask students to write a thank you note to someone who is not expecting it, and offer time in class to write and read the notes, if participants want to share. One woman wrote a thank you note for someone who helped her cope with a difficult illness; she began to cry as she read what she wrote. Through tears, she said it made her feel good to write it. The note was not only for the recipient. It was also for the giver. She needed to feel the bounty of life, not despite her health struggle, but because of it. She needed to see beyond tragedy to a world of affirming kindnesses. <span class=""it-text"">Dayenu.</span></p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 45,"<p class=""body""><span class=""it-text"">Dayenu</span> teaches us that we need to be grateful immediately after an act of kindness and also to be thankful in the long-term for how all of those acts come together to form who we are. At every interval in life’s journey, a thank you forces a pause of meaning, an interruption that stops us on the path and makes us stand still. And this helps us better understand why we confess every Yom Kippur for not respecting our parents and teachers sufficiently. More than anyone else, they guide us through often painful and difficult passages of time when we need to grow emotionally and intellectually. We may blame them or harbor anger at one stage of our growth, then later come to appreciate the very prodding that at an earlier stage bewildered or troubled us. They are with us for the long haul. <span class=""it-text"">Dayenu</span>.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 46,"<p class=""body"">Ruth Fainlight is a contemporary English poet, writer, and translator. She, too, helps us stop and savor the moment. She helps us look up in this season of judgment and offer praise:</p>"

Day Six: Gratitude 53,"<p class=""body-first-no-sp-b4"">As we confess any disrespect we show to parents or teachers, two figures of authority in our lives, let’s redeem any hurt by acknowledging the goodness of parents and teachers in making us who we are. We often take these relationships for granted; we may disrespect them simply through a failure to acknowledge them. Even if relationships are strained or difficult, we can always find qualities to admire. Sometimes growing that admiration becomes the opening for a new kind of relationship.</p>"

Day Six: Gratitude 55,"<p class=""body-first""><span class=""it-text"">First Note</span>: Write a thank you note to your parents (or one of your parents). You couldn’t possibly capture all that they have done for you but try the <span class=""it-text"">dayenu</span> technique. Think of several ways that your parents have influenced you and include them all. The more specific you are, the more your thank you will have impact and meaning. Make this the note that your parent will keep because it speaks of a bond that is unique. If your thank you note can be given to ten other people, it is not personal enough.</p>"
Day Six: Gratitude 56,"<p class=""body-first""><span class=""it-text"">Second Note</span>: Now write a note to a teacher who influenced you or modeled a special trait or taught you an important subject, even if it was a very long time ago. Try to track that teacher down. Tell this teacher what you are doing and how what they gave you helped make you into the person you are now. Great teachers are hard to find, but their names and positive associations stay with us for a lifetime.

Day Seven: Anger 2,"<p class=""chapter-first""><span class=""First-Letter"">V</span><span class=""optical"">ery </span>soon, as we wind down the holiday season, we will complete our reading of the whole Torah and celebrate this accomplishment on Simĥat Torah. We close Deuteronomy 34, the very last chapter, with the death of Moses. It seems a fitting end: we close the book with the close of the life of its most central leader. Moses died fighting after struggling with a lifetime of anger management. Moses managed the anger of a people who complained incessantly about wilderness conditions. Moses managed God’s anger after the golden calf incident and flare-ups throughout the trek, petitioning God to extend every reservoir of mercy to a wayward collection of ragtag travelers who had lost their way. And Moses had his own anger to manage<span class=""no-break""> </span>– in the very same inciden<span class=""no-break"">t –</span> when the tablets he brought down to edify, educate, and uplift the community suddenly seemed irrelevant, given the idolatrous leanings of the masses.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 3,"<p class=""body"">Moses’ management of these competing angers was perhaps his most significant contribution to leadership; he was able to negotiate a peace broad enough to sustain fragile relationships over forty years. The anger was pervasive and profound, but it did not derail Moses’ larger vision. It did, however, get in the way of Moses’ personal crowning achievement: his own entrance into the land of Israel. When he hit the rock instead of speaking to it and called the people rebels, his anger merited a harsh punishment; he could see the land but not step into it. Anger always has a cost.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 4,"<p class=""body"">A small collection of midrashim called <span class=""it-text"">Midrash Petirat Moshe </span>(midrashim on the death of Moses), probably written between the seventh and eleventh centuries, was first published in the sixteenth century in Constantinople, and it traced Moses’ last hours. In this set of midrashim on Moses’ demise, a <span class=""it-text"">bat kol</span> (“heavenly voice”) came down from the skies and said to Moses: “It is time for you to be taken from this world.” Moses, it is time to go, the voice beckoned. Moses pleaded with God: “Remember the day when You revealed Yourself to me at the bush! Remember Sinai and the forty days and nights I spent there! Please, please don’t turn me over to the Angel of Death.”</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 5,"<p class=""body"">When Moses realized that his supplication amounted to words in the wind, he used an unusual delaying tactic. He asked God if he could bless the Jewish people one more time, each tribe with a separate blessing. This would buy him more time. But just as he was in the midst of delivering his farewells, he saw that his time had almost run out. The Angel of Death was losing patience. Moses gathered everyone together quickly for one collective blessing. But, much as Jacob blessed his sons with many gloomy predictions about their future, Moses’ blessing was no blessing. It was a request for <span class=""it-text"">me</span><span class=""it-text"">ĥ</span><span class=""it-text"">ila</span>, forgiveness: “I made you suffer to keep Torah and mitzvot,” he said, <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">ve’akhshav ma</span><span class=""it-text"">ĥ</span><span class=""it-text"">lu li</span>”<span class=""no-break""> –</span> now, grant me your forgiveness.

Then the people cried out to Moses: “Moses, our teacher<span class=""no-break"">,</span> we angered you and made your life difficult<span class=""no-break""> –</span> forgive us.” And he responded, “I forgive you.” And then he was gone. Moses ran out of time. He used his very last breath to ask forgiveness from his people, and his people asked forgiveness from him. It was forgiveness for anger, an anger that trailed forty years of imposin<span class=""no-break"">g </span>– and questioning<span class=""no-break""> </span>– authority.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;For these midrashim in translation, see H.L.

Day Seven: Anger 6,"<p class=""body"">The relationship between anger and forgiveness is not hard to conjure. Anger that feels uncontrollable often gets resolved in a passionate and meaningful display of contrition. The vehemence of anger often turns into the desperate plea to be forgiven, substituting one intensity of emotion for another. But the pattern of sin, anger, exile, and forgiveness is so well established in life and in biblical history that it wearies us and makes us wonder if it will ever come to an end. Are we destined to replay it constantly, much like someone in an abusive relationship characterized by violence followed by forgiveness? The pattern emotionally exhausts and depletes its victims and often its perpetrators.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 7,"<p class=""body"">This midrash may sound like the happy ending we wanted for our venerable leader, but in reality, there is something exceptionally tragic about it. A forty-year tumultuous relationship ended with an apology with only minutes left to a life. Had Moses both asked for forgiveness and granted it earlier, he could have put the anger behind him and enjoyed a changed relationship. He may even have been buried in the Promised Land.</p>"

Any opposition to the will of a furious person is met with intimidating wrath, to the degree that “his heart is no longer with him and his judgment vanishes.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rabbi Moshe Haim Luzzatto, The Path of the Just (Jerusalem: Feldheim Publishers, 1980), 161.&lt;/i&gt;</span> Anger clouds rationality and is a force so potent in the person of fury that he is almost <span class=""no-break"">unrecognizable</span>; his state of anger is entirely different from his normal temperament. It is this kind of anger that our sages probably thought of when one remarked: “A person who is angry it is as if he worshipped idols.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Shabbat 105b.&lt;/i&gt;</span> The anger described here is so intense and destructive that Rabbi Luzzatto feared the worst for those caught in the cyclone of its path: “A man such as he would destroy the entire world if it were within his power to do so, for he is not in any way directed by reason and is as devoid of sensibility as any predatory beast.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Luzzatto, The Path of the Just, 161.&lt;/i&gt;</span> This kind of anger is primal and animalistic. It surges forth indiscriminately, and Rabbi Luzzatto worried that in the state of rage, a person with this kind of anger could commit any number of heinous crimes.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 14,"<p class=""body"">Because fury has such a transformative impact on its victims, those who suffer this type of anger will often apologize profusely: “I don’t know what happened to me” or “I didn’t mean it.” And in some odd way, they may be right. The rabid, apoplectic person that spewed out venom is not the same person when contrite. Anger has so wholly taken over that the individual becomes unrecognizable. But when this happens more than once without sufficient accountability, the apologies stop working. No one believes the perpetrator.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 15,"<p class=""sub-1"">Slow Burn</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 16,"<p class=""body-first-no-sp-b4"">This anger is not easily ignited but burns hot once it is. In the words of <span class=""it-text"">Ethics of the Fathers</span>, this state belongs to one who is slow to anger. Unlike the person of fury whose anger is easily set off and takes a long time to wear off, the worst of possible conditions, this individual does not need to control every small point or react to everything that might get under his skin. Slow burn takes time to gather its forces, but when it does it is relentless and destructive. The anger is just as virulent when it hits as it is in the first case. It is so damaging that “he will not afterwards be able to straighten what he has made crooked.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;</span> We can do damage control for slights and mild insults, but fits of anger like these stay imprinted on the memory of others like a Rorschach blot of bitterness, as it says in Job, “Envy kills the fool” (Job 5:2). Many relationships are killed by anger.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 17,"<p class=""sub-1"">Restrained Anger</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 18,"<p class=""body-first-no-sp-b4"">Anger that is not easily aroused, and even when aroused is restrained, represents for Rabbi Luzzatto a higher level of self-control. This type of anger does not descend into irrationality, yet the one who has it is still called “a man of anger”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 163.&lt;/i&gt;</span> because he nurses his wrath. Rather than a slow burn, it is more like a simmer. The person has less to lose than his angrier friends, but he is still touched and moved by his anger in some way. Rabbi Luzzatto places this entire discussion in his chapter on cleanliness. Here he refers not to physical hygiene but to certain negative character traits and what we look like when we have managed to clean ourselves of even the slightest smack of their deleterious effects. A person clean of anger has no simmering anger. It comes and goes. It does not linger.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 19,"<p class=""sub-1"">Appropriate Anger</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 20,"<p class=""body-first-no-sp-b4"">It is hard to think of any expression of anger as appropriate, but Rabbi Luzzatto did not recommend placidity and passivity in the face of outrage or in instances when passion can become an important educational tool, as in a teaching or parenting relationship. Controlled anger may be necessary to ensure that an important life message penetrates the heart and mind of the listener. In this instance, <span class=""it-text"">The Path </span><span class=""it-text"">of the Just </span>recommends, “Any anger shown…should be anger of the face and not anger of the heart.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid.&lt;/i&gt;</span> This individual may experience anger, but it is not consuming. It takes a long time for anger to surface, and it is quickly let go into the ether where it flies away before doing any real damage. A person who can achieve this level of control and relinquishment is worthy of Rabbi Luzzatto’s praise. This is reminiscent of a statement made by the sage Adda ben Ahaba: “Anger never went to bed with me.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ta’anit 20b.&lt;/i&gt;</span> He did not say that he never experienced anger, only that it was not his company in the middle of the night. Adda ben Ahaba was not lying in his bed stewing with glowering insomnia. Contrast this to a refrigerator magnet: “Don’t go to sleep angry. Stay up and fight.”</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 21,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Luzzatto concludes this section of his writing with a famous talmudic quote about the signature of a person as he or she walks in the world: “A person is recognized in three ways: through his goblet, through his pocket, and through his anger.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Eiruvin 65b.&lt;/i&gt;</span> A goblet can refer to the way a person holds his drink according to some commentaries. To others, it refers to the way we share the food at our table: if our cup truly runneth over, then we openly share our abundance with others. The pocket refers to our philanthropic giving. We are judged not by what we have but ultimately by what we give away. And the last hallmark of our footprint in this world is the way we manage our anger. It’s as simple and as difficult as that.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 22,"<p class=""body"">Hundreds of years before Rabbi Luzzatto offered his commentary on this passage from <span class=""it-text"">Ethics of </span><span class=""it-text"">the Fathers</span>, Nahmanides wrote an ethical will to his son, “In Praise of Humility.” His chief concern was that his son understand the relationship between anger and humility and remind himself continually about the importance of self-control. Nahmanides even advised his son to read the letter weekly to keep its content fresh in his mind as a guardian over his behavior. The letter became so popular that it is included in many prayerbooks. These excerpts illustrate Nahmanides’ understanding of anger as a manifestation of the ego:</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 23,"<p class=""extract-first"">“Hear, my son, the instruction of your father, and forsake not the teaching of your mother” (Proverbs 1:8). Train yourself always to speak softly to every man. You will then avoid anger for which there is no worse trait for it brings a man to sin. Our Rabbis said: “Whoever flies into a rage, every kind of Hell has dominion over him.” As it is said: “Therefore remove anger from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh” (Ecclesiastes 11:10)….</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 24,"<p class=""extract"">And when you are saved from anger your heart will embrace the trait of humility, which is the finest of all good traits, as it is said: “The reward of humility is the fear of the Lord” (Proverbs 22:4). As a result of humility the fear of the Lord will enter your heart. For you will reflect upon whence you came and whither you are going, and that even in your lifetime you are a worm and a maggot, how much more so after your death. And you will reflect that you will be called upon to give a full account of your deeds before the King of glory….</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 25,"<p class=""extract"">I shall, therefore, explain to you how to conduct yourself with humility and how to make this virtue your own at all times. All your words should be spoken gently. Your head should be bent, your eyes gazing downward to the ground and your heart upward. When you address someone do not look him in the face. Let every man seem superior to you in your own eyes….</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 26,"<p class=""extract"">Read this letter once a week and do not fail to keep its instructions.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;As translated by Louis Jacobs, Jewish Ethics, Philosophy and Mysticism (New York: Behrman House, 1969), pp. 19–21.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Seven: Anger 27,"<p class=""body-first"">Anger makes us elevate ourselves over others in judgment. Nahmanides advises a number of techniques to assist in modifying anger, many of them involving body language suggesting submissiveness and subordination: bowing the head, lowering the eyes, imagining the heart advancing upwards, speaking softly. And then there are the larger conceptual ways that we humble ourselves: know from whence you came and before whom you are called in judgment. It is difficult to judge others when we imagine God judging us. When we think of the small space we will occupy in the ground at the end of our days, we begin to realize that we should carry ourselves with that smallness and humility while we are alive.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 28,"<p class=""body"">Maimonides also devised a technique to modify character problems<span class=""no-break""> –</span> chief among them anger<span class=""no-break""> –</span> for the life of the heart and mind. In this excerpt from the <span class=""it-text"">The Laws of Character Traits</span>, Maimonides uses the Aristotelian notion of the golden mean to achieve balance in the face of anger or other character deficiencies:</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 29,"<p class=""extract-first"">Each and every man possesses many character traits. Each trait is very different and distant from the others. One type of man is wrathful; he is constantly angry. [In contrast,] there is the calm individual who is never moved to anger, or, if at all, he will be slightly angry, [perhaps once] during a period of several years…<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Mishneh Torah, The Laws of Character Traits 1:1–4.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Seven: Anger 30,"<p class=""extract-first"">The two extremes of each trait, which are at a distance from one another, do not reflect a proper path. It is not fitting that a man should behave in accordance with these extremes or teach them to himself. If he finds that his nature leans towards one of the extremes or adapts itself easily to it, or, if he has learned one of the extremes and acts accordingly, he should bring himself back to what is proper and walk in the path of the good. This is the straight path.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;The Laws of Personality Development 1:3.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Seven: Anger 31,"<p class=""body-first"">Although Maimonides generally advocates moderation, when it comes to anger, he believed that only yielding to humility in the extreme would help counter the problem.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 2:3.&lt;/i&gt;</span> When we suffer anger, Maimonides advises us to take on behavior that generates humility to pull ourselves to the opposite extreme, thereby locating an acceptable balance. The notion of achieving balance in this fashion may sound unrealistic but Jewish law is generally founded upon the notion that good deeds shape character. We do not wait for a generous impulse to give or to help others. That impulse may never surface, but if the world is built on kindness (Psalms 89:3) then enforced behaviors, witnessed and supported by communities of caring, help us manage our worst selves to bring out our best selves.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 32,"<p class=""body"">And if this method still sounds unlikely, we turn back the clock to 1897 to another Jewish writer: Max Beerbohm. Beerbohm wrote a story called “The Happy Hypocrite: A Fairy Tale for Tired Men,” about a man named Lord George Hell. Lord George is not just mean; he also looks mean. He is cruel and depraved and seems beyond redemption. One day, Lord George sees a beautiful girl performing in a show. Her name is Jenny, and she is the essence of kindness. He falls deeply in love with her. But Jenny sees right through him, telling him that she would only marry a man with the face of a saint. Lord George begins to see himself through her eyes and realizes that he can never win Jenny’s heart as he is. He develops a plan, asking a famous mask-maker in London to make him a saint’s mask, one that will make him appear handsome and kind. This artisan is such an expert that no one can tell that Lord George is wearing a mask. Everyone believes that they are seeing Lord George’s true new face. With this mask, Lord George approaches Jenny and eventually wins her heart. In registering their marriage, George writes his name as “George Heaven.” Living with Jenny, he learns the art of selflessness and kindness. He is careful never to remove his mask, and he becomes a giving and wonderful husband to Jenny. Behind this mask, he has learned to become a different person, and he works hard to refrain from any of his former behaviors.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 33,"<p class=""body"">But the story does not end here. One day George encounters an old enemy; he had accumulated many in his previous life. The enemy sees straight through George’s mask and, in front of Jenny, rips it off. Lord George is terrified<span class=""no-break""> –</span> and the reader trembles in fear as well. But as the mask is ripped off, we find that George’s face underneath is not the same face that it had been when he put the mask on. Over the years his features conformed to the mask and now<span class=""no-break""> –</span> even underneath it<span class=""no-break""> –</span> he is handsome and kind.</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 34,"<p class=""sub-1-new-page"">Life Homework</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 35,"<p class=""body-first-no-sp-b4"">Consider the four types of anger: 1) quick to anger but quick to release it, 2) slow to anger but slow to release it, 3) slow to anger but quick to release it, and 4) quick to anger but slow to release it. Which most closely describes your temperament?</p>"
Day Seven: Anger 36,"<p class=""body"">Once you have identified the category closest to your own type of anger, consider writing a letter to an imaginary someone (or to your children or life partner) that discusses the role anger plays in your life: in your childhood, perhaps on the receiving end of anger, and then as an adult. If you have children, think about their temperaments, how you help them with anger management, and the cost of anger in their relationships. In the letter, suggest techniques that might help someone in your anger category or another category handle anger in a more controlled, more helpful way.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 1,"<p class=""_8-Quotation--prelims-at-top-of-page-"">“For the sin we committed before You by callously hardening the heart.”</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 2,"<p class=""chapter-first""><span class=""First-Letter"">T</span><span class=""optical"">his </span>period of time often puts people in a somber mood. Reflecting on the self and the ways we need to change can easily slip into a depressive evaluation in which we always come up short, and when we do, the joy that is inherent in these holidays is lost, robbing us of the self-confidence we need to make the adjustments ahead.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 3,"<p class=""body"">One of the ways we capture the joy of this season is through music. Some of us regard the familiar tunes that have guided us in our prayers since childhood as a visit from old friends. The joy of singing in community and filling the sanctuary with haunting, ethereal tunes, some of which are over a thousand years old, carries us to a place of transcendence and loftiness. Even when the words dwell on judgment and consequences, the melodies lift us high above the content, inspiring us to live the lyrics and offering us the joyous possibility that anything can happen. We are united, strong, and beautiful. It is unadulterated spiritual happiness, and it is powerful.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 4,"<p class=""body"">One of the most joyous melodies of Yom Kippur is the song sung close to the end of the Musaf service praising the Kohen, high priest, who would enter the Holy of Holies and ask God to forgive us on Yom Kippur. If his sacrifice of expiation was not accepted, he died. If he left this holiest of chambers alive, the people rejoiced in ancient collective relief. They saw the Kohen’s face lit with the majesty of forgiveness, a face that has become a model of the joy each of us experiences as we near the end of the service. We, too, have been forgiven. This song is often belted out in traditional congregations, as if we were standing and waiting in the Temple for our leader’s appearance, and saw in our first glimpse of him the absolute happiness of a person exculpated from sin. The song focuses us on the serenity of this spiritual leader as he rejoined the people peacefully and unharmed. In the prayer, he is compared to a glitter of light, a rainbow in the clouds, a garment of splendor, a rose in a beautiful garden, a groom filled with grace, a bright star, an angel, a candle that shines in windows, the rising sun. As we raise our voices, we relive the moment of forgiveness with him. We are there. The moment is sweet and pure.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 5,"<p class=""body"">Since these songs are old friends, or new friends for some, it can be difficult when the person leading services picks an unfamiliar melody or one that you do not like. You feel betrayed since some of these prayers are only uttered once a year. You have to wait an entire year for another opportunity. As I have often said, “There is no anger like the anger at someone who does not sing your tunes.” Not singing my tunes is like stealing my joy, and I have, on occasion, had the chutzpah to ask friends who lead services to repeat a prayer with my tune in the synagogue’s coatroom since it just wouldn’t be the holiday without hearing it.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 6,"<p class=""body"">In a High Holiday sermon, Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik once observed that when he first arrived in Germany and heard Yom Kippur songs sung to joyful tunes, he was shocked; this was in stark contrast to his memory of services in Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, he observed that both approaches are legitimate, since “there is also great joy on the day that our sins are forgiven.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff, The Rav: The World of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik (New York: Ktav, 1999), 2:176. Also published in Yemei Zikaron (17:12): 240 (Yiddish).&lt;/i&gt;</span> He experienced that joy in the act of fasting and reflected on how sad he would be if he were not able to fast. One of his great phobias was the fear that with age he might one day be forced to break the fast for medical reasons: “I do not fast because of any normative pressure. I simply find delight, joy, and happiness in fasting, praying, and cleansing myself.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rakeffet-Rothkoff, The Rav, 2:177, from the Rav’s lecture “Rashi on Aseret Hadibrot” at the RCA Annual Convention (June 30, 1970).&lt;/i&gt;</span> The chance to start again from the inside out is a relief, a portal into lasting future happiness.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 7,"<p class=""body"">Sin and joy live in strange relation to each other. In Deuteronomy, we are remonstrated for not serving God with joy. Our happiness is a gift of faith, and if religion only makes us heavy-hearted and solemn then we have wronged it. “Because you did not serve the Lord, your God, with joyfulness and with gladness of heart by reason of the abundance of all things, therefore shall you serve your enemy whom the Lord shall send against you” (28:47–48). Maimonides cited this verse in his <span class=""it-text"">Laws of Repentance</span> (9:1) as a proof-text that if you serve God with love you will experience great blessing, but the reverse is also true. In the same biblical book, God presents a pattern that repeats itself throughout our long and tortured history. Sin will remove you from your homeland and be the cause of your exile. During exile, you will begin to understand the cost of distance from God and pine for closeness. You will contemplate the causal relationship of actions and their consequences and pray to God and repent. God will then gather Israel “from all the peoples where the Lord your God has scattered you. Even if your outcasts are at the ends of the world” (30:3–4). The process of repentance on a national scale will make us stronger, and, as result, “He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers” (30:5). The backsliding can be remedied. There is always a path out of sin, individual and collective, and that path back will yield more than one could have ever anticipated. It will bring happiness.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 8,"<p class=""body"">But the joy at the end of the long road home can be achieved, according to this text, only if there is recognition of sin, a self-awareness that we often create the worst of possible worlds for ourselves. In the prescription for a future of greater joy, God recommends an odd “medical” procedure, an opening of the heart; the term used in the verse literally means that God will circumcise our hearts. God will create a small hole, a puncture in the thickness of our stubborn, often callous hearts, so that we can experience true happiness and live: “Then the Lord your God will open up [<span class=""it-text"">mal</span>] your heart and the hearts of your offspring to love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul, in order that you may live” (30:6). That small hole will release the blockage that gets in the way of authentic love and compassion. It is a spiritual stent, so to speak, that allows the heart to do its most important work.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 9,"<p class=""body"">Robert Goolrick, in his painful memoir, <span class=""it-text"">The End of the World as</span><span class=""it-text""> We Know It</span>, writes about how much sorrow the human heart holds: “There is so much that happens to the human heart that is in the realm of the unthinkable, the unknowable, the unbearable.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Robert Goolrick, The End of the World as We Know It (Chapel Hill: Algonquin Books, 2008), 95.&lt;/i&gt;</span> We harden the heart so that nothing can get in, and for that we confess multiple times: <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">For the sin we committed before You </span><span class=""it-text"">by callously hardening the heart</span>.”<span class=""it-text""> </span>We make no hole for the release of unbearable pain. We hold it in, and it begins to warp our capacity for grace.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 10,"<p class=""body"">“The virtue of a sacred heart lies in the courage to maintain your innocence and wonder, your doubt and curiosity, and your compassion and love even through your darkest, most difficult moments.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ronald A. Heifetz and Marty Linsky, Leadership on the Line (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2002), 227.&lt;/i&gt;</span> This description of a sacred heart, a heart open to vulnerability and kindness, comes from an unexpected corner: a leadership book published by the Harvard Business School Press. In it, the authors observe that many leaders who develop thick skin to motivate and manage others harden themselves from the best of human nature and the transcendent and inspiring aspects of their work. But the message resonates far beyond the realms of leadership to that of everyday human experience. How can we keep the hole in our hearts open so that we can face life’s vicissitudes and be appropriately touched by them without developing the callous outer layer that covers us and makes us numb to the range of human experience?</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 11,"<p class=""extract-first"">A sacred heart means you may feel tortured and betrayed, powerless and hopeless, and yet you stay open. It’s the capacity to encompass the entire range of your human experience without hardening or closing yourself. It means that even in the midst of disappointment and defeat, you remain connected to people and to the sources of your most profound purposes.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Ibid., 230.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Eight: Joy 12,"<p class=""body-first"">Circumcision is not a word we usually associate with joy, and yet the idea of intentionally making oneself more vulnerable by removing an outer layer of protection is a lesson in how to live, in how to feel deeply. Our hearts need that hole. It must be wide enough to admit passion and compassion and anguish but small enough to filter the emotions that paralyze us, and prevent us from transformation and caring. This need and struggle is beautifully described in Rabbi Alan Lew’s book about this season, <span class=""it-text"">This Is Real and You Are Completely Unprepared</span>:</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 13,"<p class=""extract-first"">Every soul needs to express itself. Every heart needs to crack itself open. Every one of us needs to move from anger to healing, from denial to consciousness, from boredom to renewal. These needs did not arise yesterday. They are among the most ancient of yearnings, and they are fully expressed in the pageantry and ritual of the Days of Awe, in the great journey we make between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Alan Lew, This Is Real and You Are Completely Unprepared (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 2003), 9.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Eight: Joy 14,"<p class=""body-first"">Our ancient yearnings, our sincere desire to be forgiven, is so much more profound as an expression of joy than the petty happinesses society offers today as a meager excuse for joy: retail therapy, comfort food, medication, money, status, gossip.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 15,"<p class=""body"">Joy lies in sound judgment and goodness. In <span class=""it-text"">Happiness in Premodern Judaism</span>, Hava Tirosh-Samuelson takes her readers through the Jewish classics, offering virtue as a Jewish synonym for joy and sprinkling that virtue with a good dose of wisdom. She takes us through a catalogue of psalms, noting that the very first psalm begins with the word “happy.” Happiness is defined as virtue and wisdom from the outset: “Happy is the man who has not followed the counsel of the wicked or taken the path of sinners or joined the company of the insolent; rather the teaching of the Lord is his delight” (Psalms 1:1). The happy person keeps good company and delights in study. Excellence of character, she believes, is “a healthy departure from the relentless pursuit of material goods, wealth, power, and celebrity that characterizes much of our childish culture.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Hava Tirosh-Samuelson, Happiness in Premodern Judaism (Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College Press, 2003), 449.&lt;/i&gt;</span> While virtue does not dispel pain or resolve every moral dilemma, it creates a noble and aspirational stretch and challenge for us. Imagine a society and culture that promotes excellence of character as the key to happiness. Judaism always has.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 16,"<p class=""body"">The positive psychologist and scholar Tal Ben-Shahar, in his book <span class=""it-text"">Happie</span><span class=""_80-italic"">r</span>, presents happiness through a range of personality types.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Tal Ben-Shahar, Happier (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007).&lt;/i&gt;</span> The nihilist believes neither in immediate happiness nor in long-term joy because all is ultimately vanity. The hedonist enjoys happiness now, knowing but usually ignoring the long-term consequences of his or her behavior. He may overeat, indulge in harmful sexual behavior, binge drink. Sometimes his short-lived impulses bring about almost tragic sadness. He drinks himself silly, disregarding the hangover that will, no doubt, appear the next day. Under the influence, he believes himself to be the captain of the universe, gets into a car, and hits and kills a pedestrian. His short-lived happiness brings untold despair to others.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 17,"<p class=""body"">We get a brief glimpse into such a moment in the Bible, when a wealthy man from the Carmel named Nabal slips up. David was not yet king. Protecting the area where Nabal lived, David sent some of his soldiers to get food from Nabal’s estate. Nabal laughed off the request: “Who is David?” (<span class=""sc"">I</span> Samuel 25:10). He spurned the request to give anything to these hungry soldiers, keeping it all for himself. When the soldiers passed on Nabal’s message, David was incensed and ready to take up arms. Abigail, Nabal’s wife, heard of the interaction and was mortified by her husband’s behavior. She amassed food to feed them all and then personally traveled to greet David, before he arrived at her estate, and apologized for her husband with a clever play on words. A <span class=""it-text"">naval</span> in Hebrew is a boor or a crass individual. “Please, my lord, pay no attention to that wretched fellow. For he is just what his name says.

Day Eight: Joy 21,"<p class=""body"">Maimonides, who occupies two chapters of Tirosh-Samuelson’s <span class=""it-text"">Happiness in Premodern Judaism</span>, promoted a return to virtue through repentance. In <span class=""it-text"">The Guide of the Perplexed</span>, he<span class=""it-text""> </span>reflects on the process of the heart cracking itself open and the seminal value of teshuva through an unusual word analysis. Maimonides comments more than once in his oeuvre on a very specific Hebrew word for randomness that appears seven times in the same chapter of Leviticus: “<span class=""it-text"">keri</span>,” or chance. In Leviticus 26, a chapter on causality and the obligations of a covenantal relationship, God points to all the blessings that will accrue if we follow God’s law, but then turns to the dangers of willful ignorance or outright hostility. Many translations take the word <span class=""it-text"">keri</span> as a form of hostility or rejection. Maimonides prefers the notion of randomness or chance: you do not believe that events happen through divine providence but understand any tragedy as mere chance and, therefore, you neither learn to improve yourself nor seek meaning when bad things befall you. Without introspection, you will persist in this behavior, bringing only further distress upon yourself.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 22,"<p class=""body"">Maimonides identifies an additional problem with this thinking. The capacity for transformation always works in two directions. We slip up. We rebuild. We fall down. We pick ourselves up. Without meditating on wrongdoing or believing that repentance is possible, we allow our lives to move in only one direction: the spiral of descent.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 23,"<p class=""extract-first"">If then the individual believed that this fracture can never be remedied, he would persist in his error and sometimes perhaps disobey even more because of the fact that no stratagem remains at his disposal. If, however, he believes in repentance, he can correct himself and return to a better and more perfect state than the one he was in before he sinned.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed iii:37, trans.

Day Eight: Joy 24,"<p class=""body-first"">If there were no way back, then people would persist and even deepen their commitment to wrongdoing. Teshuva must exist in concept and in act to offer a road out of sin even before an act of sin is committed. The capacity to recalibrate and progress stands in relation to the gravitational pull downwards.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 25,"<p class=""body"">What happens to people who do not believe that repentance is a possibility? They shorten their joy. They cut themselves off from the liberation of the soul. As an illustration, we turn to the first penitent in the Bible: Cain. Cain killed his brother, committing the first murder between the very first brothers, not exactly a propitious beginning for the family dynamic moving forward. Only if we read Cain as an innocent who did not know the full freight of his anger or what the death of his brother really meant can we begin to understand how much Cain was tortured by his sin. Cain did not protest to God that his punishment was too great to bear, as many mistranslations render Genesis 4:13. The word <span class=""_80"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">avon</span>” is familiar in our prayers this season; it means sin, and once Cain understood that his brother would not return, he understood that he had to return. He had to rebuild his relationship with God and himself. He told God: “My sin is too great to bear.” I cannot live with myself.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 26,"<p class=""body"">Sin strips us of joy. It traps and paralyzes us. It makes us restless and anxious. When sin is too great to bear, life stands in the balance.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 27,"<p class=""body"">God explained the primal surge of anger and our ability to overcome it before Cain killed Abel, but Cain did not understand it. “Why are you distressed, and why is your face fallen? Surely if you do right, there is uplift. But if you do not do right sin crouches at the door; its urge is towards you yet you can be its master” (4:6–7). Goodness lifts us up. Sin drags us down. Temptation appears every time we open the door, like a crouching animal ready to pounce. But we have mastery over the door. We can close it.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 28,"<p class=""body"">Cain did not heed these words. He opened the door to sin widely, and it pounced on him, egging him on, besetting him with its ferocity. The Italian Renaissance artist, Titian, rendered the murder as the tangle of muscular sinews; both brothers are locked in the tussle, but perhaps it was God’s words that Cain ultimately wrestled with but could not conquer. The urge to do wrong is muscular and strong, virtually unyielding and persistent. But it can be defeated.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 29,"<p class=""body"">After the murder, when Cain reflected on the burden of his wrongdoing, he understood that in a world where primal urges reign, others could do to him what he did to his brother. He was terrified at the thought that he, too, could be murdered just as he had murdered. God gave him a mark of protection, and then Cain left the presence of God and married and had a child and built a city. Cursed with being a wanderer, Cain’s repentance allowed him the stability to build a new life, to find joy.</p>"
Day Eight: Joy 30,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Mordechai of Lekhovitz (d. 1811), commenting on the verse about Cain’s mark: “And the Lord set a sign for Cain lest anyone who meet him should kill him” (Genesis 4:15), observed that this odd sign upon Cain’s forehead would be noticeable to all who saw him. That was precisely the point. His mark was a sign of preservation. The rebbe, however, did not regard it as a sign for <span class=""no-break"">others –</span> but rather for Cain himself: “God gave Cain, the penitent, a sign of strength and holiness, so that no accident he met with should beat his spirit down and disturb him in his work of repentance.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Martin Buber, Tales of the Hasidim: Later Masters (New York: Schocken Books, 1977), 155.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"

Day Eight: Joy 34,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Hanina ben Isaac, author of this midrash, added another dimension by excerpting a verse from elsewhere. What was Cain feeling when he left the presence of the Lord with this mark of protection? “He went forth rejoicing.”</p>"

Day Ten: Holiness 2,"<p class=""chapter-first""><span class=""First-Letter"">Y</span><span class=""optical"">ou </span>shall be holy, for I, the Lord your God, am holy” (Leviticus 19:2). Holiness is a mandate. We are obligated to be holy but without necessarily understanding what holiness demands of us. The German theologian Rudolph Otto (1869–1937) tried to analyze the component parts of the sacred in his book <span class=""it-text"">The Idea of </span><span class=""it-text"">the Holy</span>, but Otto’s language is dense and opaque.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rudolph Otto, The Idea of the Holy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1958).&lt;/i&gt;</span> Holiness, Otto believed, is a mystery, both terrifying and fascinating. He believed that holiness is a non-rational and non-sensory experience that he termed “numinous,” referring to its unknowable quality. As interesting and influential as Otto’s writing is, the book offers little practical guidance on what it could mean to live the lofty and ethereal demands of this call from Leviticus.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 3,"<p class=""body"">As we become more attuned to the sacredness of each day of the ten days of repentance, we confess when we have fallen short of this desideratum. Further on in Leviticus, sanctifying God and profaning God live right next to each other: “You shall not profane My holy name, that I may be sanctified in the midst of the Israelite people, I the Lord who sanctify you” (22:32). The verse presents what looks like a causal relationship. If I do not profane, then I sanctify. But holiness does not strike us as a neutral state that demands no active striving. We wonder what it means to desecrate God’s name just as we try to understand what it means to make it holy in our act of<span class=""it-text""> vidui</span>, confession. Is desecration a conscious act of minimizing God’s presence in our lives or even profaning it, or is it simply ignoring the sacred, pretending that transcendence is not relevant to us? A midrash on the book of Numbers hints at the second:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 4,"<p class=""extract-first"">Entrances to holiness are everywhere.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 5,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">The possibility of ascent is all the time.</p>"

Day Ten: Holiness 8,"<p class=""body-first"">There are portals to holiness everywhere, but we often walk in the world as if we have no map to them, as if they do not exist. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner’s interpretation of this midrash prods us to ask if we really strive for holiness on this day and every day after it:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 9,"<p class=""extract-first"">You do not have to go anywhere to raise yourself. You do not have to become anyone other than yourself to find entrances. You are already there. You are already everything you need to be. Entrances are everywhere and all the time. “There is no man who does not have his hour, and no thing that does not have its place” (<span class=""it-text"">Ethics of the Fathers</span> 4:3).<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Kushner, Eyes Remade for Wonder, 18.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 10,"<p class=""body-first"">As we move up the ladder of holiness on Yom Kippur, we realize that we have scaled the heights to arrive at this entrance but feel lower than ever before. We cannot access a way in to God. We gravitate between intimacy and distance. One minute we are close to imbuing everything we do with transcendence and the next we feel all of our inadequacies rising, filling us with dread and humility.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 11,"<p class=""body"">Our prayer moments parallel this experience, taking us up and down with their ascents and descents, mirroring this emotional rise and fall with uncanny unpredictability. We praise God’s name and God’s capacity for mercy, elevating us and giving us the promise to reach out and bridge the chasm. Then suddenly our prayers turn precipitously to human beings and throw us into existential crisis:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 12,"<p class=""extract-first"">Man, his beginning is from dust and ends in dust; risking his life, he gets his bread. He is like a potsherd that cracks, like grass that withers, like the flower that fades, like the shadow that passes, like the cloud that vanishes, like the wind that blows, like the dust that flies, and like a fleeting dream…(<span class=""it-text"">Unetaneh Tokef</span> prayer)</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 13,"<p class=""body-first"">The impermanence of our condition renders our grasp for the sacred an anomaly. We are here and then we will go, sometimes without notice. We have the same ephemeral quality as shadows, dust, and dreams. We cannot achieve the sacred; we are as breakable as clay. And again, as we immerse ourselves in these doubts and anxieties, the prayer mood shifts again: “But You are the King, the Almighty, the living and the everlasting God.” Our frailty is contrasted to God’s stability, and we find ourselves once again on terra firma. We will hold on tightly to the Rock and gain strength from God’s presence.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 14,"<p class=""body"">To be holy in Hebrew is to consecrate or separate something so that it achieves distinction. We step out of our this-worldly experience and into another, one which exudes mystery and strangeness. When Moses experienced revelation at the burning bush, God told him to remove his shoes, to take off his layer of this-worldliness so that he could enter another universe of discourse. He had to take off that which separated him from the ground to understand that he was not in a place ruled by expected norms: “Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground” (Exodus 3:5). When Moses was called he answered, <span class=""_50"">“</span><span class=""it-text"">Hineni</span>.” I am in the moment. I am fully present. I have answered the call to holiness. Only in that state will the impossible become possible.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 15,"<p class=""body"">We are standing right now, at this moment in time, on the brink of infinite possibility. We stand here as individuals ready for change, enveloped and carried by the love of community. There are no <span class=""no-break"">divisions</span>. There are no distractions. As we enter this, the holiest day of the year, we are saying with the setting of the sun that we have let go of the insistence that all is impossible, all the thoughts and intentions and motivations that tell us we can never change. For the next twenty-five hours, we will separate ourselves from this world in order to experience another world where all change is possible. The doors to possibility are opening. They are waiting for us to say <span class=""it-text"">hineni</span>: I am fully present here, and I can achieve the impossible.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 16,"<p class=""body"">But what if you are not ready to say <span class=""it-text"">hineni</span> to the call of holiness as Moses did? What if you do not believe that people can really change or that the portals into transcendence are really accessible? The possibility of teshuva has been argued for millennia. You are not alone.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 17,"<p class=""body"">We begin with the argument for impossibility. Teshuva undoubtedly is an impossible idea. It asks us to believe without question that people can change. This represents an enormous leap of faith for most. There are people who can believe in an intangible God, but the same individuals cannot believe that they can change themselves. Better yet, there are those who believe that they can change but that no one else can: “He’ll always be the same.” “Once an addict, always an addict.” “She always does that.”</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 18,"<p class=""body"">And then we turn to the ultimate story of the impossibility of teshuva. It is told in any number of places, from passages in the Talmud to Milton Steinberg’s <span class=""it-text"">As a Driven Leaf</span>.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Milton Steinberg, As a Driven Leaf (Springfield, nj: Behrman House, 1996).&lt;/i&gt;</span> In Ĥagiga 15a, we find one of the Talmud’s most colorful characters: Elisha ben Abuya, the grade A heretic of an ancient past whose name was changed to “Aĥer”<span class=""no-break""> –</span> or the Other<span class=""no-break""> –</span> when he became a heretic. He was once a learned scholar but then became someone else, a person who had lost his faith. He witnessed a young boy obeying the command of his father to climb a tree and shoo away a mother bird to retrieve its eggs. The lad fulfilled two biblical commandments, the only two that promise long life, but toppled off the tree and died. In wonder, Elisha ben Abuya, who witnessed the fall, responded in disbelief: “Is this the Torah, and is this its reward?” and then dropped his faith.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 19,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Meir, Aĥer’s most devoted student, studied Torah with him even when he left traditional Judaism. The Talmud tells us of a time when the two were traveling together on Shabbat. A lengthy <span class=""it-text"">Tosafot</span>, medieval commentary, on this story uses one version to suggest that it was not on just any Shabbat but Shabbat and Yom Kippur at the same time. It was the second half of the first century on a day of holiness with the added bonus of being even more holy than usual. Rabbi Meir was walking and learning from Aĥer, who was riding a horse on the Shabbat of Yom Kippur, transgressing a well-known prohibition. The scene itself seems unimaginable. They reached the <span class=""it-text"">te</span><span class=""it-text"">ĥ</span><span class=""it-text"">um Shabbat</span>, the invisible boundary beyond which carrying is no longer permitted, and Aĥer told Rabbi Meir to go back. He did not want to be responsible for the violations of his student, whose faith remained intact. Rabbi Meir, using the notion of this boundary as a metaphor for change, said to his revered teacher, the heretic, “You also turn back.” The words were few but loaded. Turn away from crossing this red line with me and repent. Come home. And Elisha uttered the ultimate statement of impossibility: “Haven’t I already told you that I heard from behind the curtain, ‘Return my wayward children, all, that is, except for Aĥer’?”</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 20,"<p class=""body"">Aĥer used the perfect justification. He had, he claimed, heard God tell him directly<span class=""no-break""> (</span>“behind the curtain” is a talmudic metaphor for veiled divine knowledge<span class=""no-break"">)</span> that everyone has the possibility of changing but him. In this act of gross self-justification, he turned the very principles he once lived by upside down, believing that he was the only exception to the rule.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 21,"<p class=""body"">When we read this talmudic legend, we believe Aĥer. We take his words at face value. Perhaps some metaphysical voice did call and tell him that everyone has a chance to change, everyone but him. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, my own revered teacher, once explained that Aĥer’s convincing himself that everyone could change but him was an act of great denial. If everyone has the capacity to be different, then there are no exceptions to the rule. It cannot be possible for everyone but impossible for him. Aĥer’s denial was so profound that he convinced himself and tried to convince Rabbi Meir that God Himself would reject Aĥer’s repentance.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 22,"<p class=""body"">Someone who already made enormous changes in his own life should have been the first to understand that change is always possible. But for him, change was only in one direction. Aĥer may have spoken about himself in the third person in this passage in order to distance himself from the message. Had he used his own given name, perhaps he would never have had the gumption to make such a statement, one that flew in the face of everything he knew about his God, his former faith, and his understanding of teshuva. Elisha separated some part of himself from what he knew to be a deep truth and spoke in the name of a God he rejected, falsifying God’s word and God’s promise. He convinced himself that change is impossible.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 23,"<p class=""body"">In a similar vein, the Jerusalem Talmud records an odd conversation about the possibility of change in contrast to Aĥer’s limited view. The question the Talmud presents is simple: What is a sinner’s punishment? Piecing together and then weaving verses liberally for answers, a common stylistic feature of <span class=""it-text"">aggada </span>(rabbinic legends), the question is answered by wisdom, the prophet, the Torah, and God:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 24,"<p class=""extract-first"">Wisdom was asked, “What should be the punishment for the sinner?” She answered, “Let evil pursue the sinner.”</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 25,"<p class=""extract-first"">Prophecy was asked, “What should be the punishment for the sinner?” She answered, “The soul that sins shall perish.”</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 26,"<p class=""extract-first"">The Torah was asked, “What should be the punishment for the sinner?” She answered, “Let him bring a sacrifice, and be atoned for.”</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 27,"<p class=""extract-first"">The Holy One, Blessed be He, was asked, “What should be the punishment for the sinner?” He answered, “Let the sinner repent, and he will find atonement.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Yalkut Shimoni, Psalm 25.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 28,"<p class=""body-first"">Wisdom here uses the voice of common sense. Common sense understands that when a person sins, he or she will suffer consequences. Sin will become its own punishment because an individual will have to live with the fact of sin in his or her life. Sin also promotes more sin, with its tumble-down effect captured in the aphorism: “Sin generates sin” in <span class=""it-text"">Ethics of the Fathers </span>(4:2).</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 29,"<p class=""body"">Prophecy takes a larger emotional view of sin’s impact. Each sin can be eliminated through punishment or recompense but, in the aggregate, sin has a corrosive effect. It wears us down. It changes us. It rusts our commitments.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 30,"<p class=""body"">The Torah takes a legal view and looks at what is technically demanded of us when we commit particular sins. We have to then make sacrifices so that God will grant atonement. If you bring a sacrifice the impact of sin is voided. In each instance an act must be done to eliminate the after-effects of sin.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 31,"<p class=""body"">The dichotomy between the prophet’s response and the Torah’s response is beautifully played out in an observation Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik makes in <span class=""it-text"">On Repentance</span>. Does teshuva imply some level of continuity of the past or the cutting off of the past? When the prophet speaks of the corrosion of the soul, he understands that the soul is the same soul, layered now with the imprint of sin. The Torah’s understanding is that a sacrifice nullifies the past; it is as if the sin had never been committed.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 32,"<p class=""extract-first"">The question whether repentance implies continuity or severance, whether it sustains the past or utterly nullifies it, depends upon the nature of the repentance. There is repentance which does allow for continuity and which accords recognition to the past, and there is also repentance whose goal is the utter annihilation of the evil in the soul of man. Certain situations leave no choice but for the annihilation of evil and for completely uprooting it.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, On Repentance (Jerusalem: Oroth Publishing House, 1980), 273.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 33,"<p class=""body-first"">The punishment mentioned in the question is not really punishment at all. What the Talmud is searching for is a deeper understanding of the consequence of sin. Sin leads to more sin. Sin weakens our resistance and corrupts. Sin is finite and transactional. It can be totally removed with the proper payment. Every one of these other lodestones of Jewish life teaches that when we transgress there is a cost attached.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 34,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Simha Bunim, the Hasidic sage, once asked his students how they could tell when a sin had been pardoned in an age without prophets. His students struggled to come up with an answer but none satisfied the rebbe. “We can tell,” he responded, “by the fact that we no longer commit that sin.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Martin Buber, Tales of the Hasidim: Later Masters (New York: Schocken Books, 1977), 253.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 35,"<p class=""body"">Into this lively discussion comes the last and most authoritative voice: God’s. God offers a response far and away the most conceptual and difficult to grasp. A sinner must repent. Ultimately that is all that is required. God defies the limitations of the other positions and says, “Just change.” No punishment, no rusting of the soul, no sacrifice will mean more to the future of the individual than the capacity and willingness to change. When that is present, God accepts repentance wholesale.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 36,"<p class=""body"">At its very core, this piece of <span class=""it-text"">aggada</span> assumes that teshuva<span class=""it-text""> </span>defies common sense, intellectual reasoning, legal manipulation, and even prophetic wisdom<span class=""no-break""> –</span> for how can one undo what was? Quite simply. Teshuva is a divine gift. It makes the impossible possible. Finally, a cryptic piece of Talmud now becomes somewhat clearer:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 37,"<p class=""extract-first"">Seven things were created before the world was created…. The Torah, repentance, the Garden of Eden, Gehenna, the Throne of Glory, the Temple, and the name of the Messiah…. Repentance, for it is written, “Before the mountains were brought forth” (Psalms 90:2).<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Pesaĥim 54a.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 38,"<p class=""body-first"">“Before the mountains were brought forth” implies that there were places and concepts created before the world was created because they defy rationality; they represent something that could not belong to a world governed by natural law. Teshuva defies reason. But, nevertheless, it exists.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 39,"<p class=""body"">The moment you shift from the impossible to the possible, you create the possibility of doing that which seems impossible. And we, as Jews, are tied into an historic nation that has defied all odds and every rational force against it. We are the people of impossibility. David Ben-Gurion said in considering the impossibility of the State of Israel, “Anyone who does not believe in miracles is not a realist.” Our national anthem, <span class=""it-text"">Hatikva</span>, is about a hope unseen and unimaginable. And what is teshuva, after all, but the most personal of miracles, the miracle of accepting and shaping a new self?</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 40,"<p class=""body"">The German psychologist Kurt Lewin (1890–1947) once wrote: “If you want to truly understand something, try to change it.” Lewin escaped World War <span class=""sc"">ii</span> by moving to the United States in the early 1930s, and after visiting professorships in a number of universities, directed the Center for Group Dynamics at <span class=""sc"">MIT</span>. He achieved fame because he believed that “human behavior is the function of both the person and the environment.” In other words, human behavior is related to both personal characteristics and the social situations in which we find ourselves. This may not seem new to us, but it was radical when he introduced it. Lewin’s research also implied that change is imminently possible. Adaptation, evolution, adjustment: these are all words that imply a new configuration to an already existing model of behavior. Tweaking something also changes it. Radical transformation is not always necessary or desirable; it can make teshuva seem harder than it has to be. Lewin understood that if you want to get to know someone or something, you need to change it. That process will bring forth resistance, curiosity, rigidity, or willingness. Change is stubborn, but it happens.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 41,"<p class=""body"">John Kotter, in <span class=""it-text"">The Heart of Change</span>,<span class=""it-text""> </span>writes:<span class=""it-text""> </span>“People change what they do less because they are given analysis that shifts their thinking than because they are shown a truth that influences their feelings.”<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;John Kotter, The Heart of Change (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2002), 1.&lt;/i&gt;</span> In other words, the heart of change is in the emotions; it is not about the pros and cons of any given decision. It transcends that. When it comes to teshuva, we may be trying to influence one side of the brain that resists us and makes it seem that repentance is out of bounds, when another side of our brain might be more receptive.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 42,"<p class=""body"">In Ezekiel, God tells us that He will help us with the daunting task of becoming holy. He will sprinkle cleansing waters upon us, removing the aura of sin that trails us at times: “And I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit into you. I will remove the heart of stone from your body and give you a heart of flesh, and I will put My spirit into you” (36:25–26). We walk into the last prayers of the day, <span class=""it-text"">Ne’ila</span>, almost cleansed of sin, with a new heart and a new spirit. Holiness is very close to us right now.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 43,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Kook wrote poetry and, just as he wrote that repentance is a great theme for poets and painters, his poem “Remove My Shame” moves us from sin to holiness, from Ezekiel’s transgression to a new heart and a new spirit:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 44,"<p class=""extract-first"">Remove my shame,</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 45,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">Lift my anxiety,</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 46,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">Absolve me of my sin</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 47,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">And enable me to pray before You</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 48,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">With gladness of heart,</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 49,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">To pursue Your commandments and Your Torah</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 50,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">In the joy of holiness.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 51,"<p class=""body-first"">God obligates us to be holy not because it is a stretch for us that is aspirational but unachievable. He demands it of us because God believes we can become holy. We, too, must remove our sin and bask in the joy of holiness. It is within our grasp. In the <span class=""it-text"">aggada</span>, God assured us of the power of change because deep down we may not believe in its possibility. God used the voice of ultimate persuasion because nothing short of the divine would convince us. All is possible. Holiness is within reach.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 52,"<p class=""sub-1"">Opening the Door for <i>Ne’</i><i>ila</i></p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 53,"<p class=""body-first-no-sp-b4"">Repentance is sometimes the last door that we decide to walk through.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 54,"<p class=""body"">One year, I was at an airport between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, and right near my gate, a man was talking on the phone loudly and gesticulating wildly. “I begged them to keep the door open. I pleaded. You don’t understand. They shut the doors. They just wouldn’t let me on the flight.” Maybe he was talking to his boss or a client. Probably his wife. As he continued to talk, he got more flustered and made more excuses for being late. But the louder he got, the clearer it was that it was his fault. He just wasn’t prepared. He got there late, and the doors were already shut.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 55,"<p class=""body"">The doors may be shut, but a door is only a portal. The decision to walk through the door is our own. This transition is magnificently captured by the late poet Adrienne Rich in “Prospective Immigrants Please Note”:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 56,"<p class=""extract-first"">Either you will go through this door</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 57,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">or you will not go through.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 58,"<p class=""extract-first"">If you go through</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 59,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">there is always the risk</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 60,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">of remembering your name.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 61,"<p class=""extract-first"">Things look at you doubly</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 62,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">and you must look back</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 63,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">and let them happen.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 64,"<p class=""extract-first"">If you do not go through</p>"

Day Ten: Holiness 70,"<p class=""extract-first"">but much will blind you,</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 71,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">much will evade you,</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 72,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">at what cost who knows?</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 73,"<p class=""extract-first"">The door itself makes no promises.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 74,"<p class=""extract-no-indent"">It is only a door.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 75,"<p class=""body-first"">The gates of heaven are only a door. There is no handbook and no map. There is no promise or guarantee. It is only a door. The door is not a promise, but it is an invitation to launch an adventure and a journey whose destination involves change. We are living in a broken world, and the key to that world is in the door of compassion, <span class=""it-text"">sha’ar hara</span><span class=""it-text"">ĥ</span><span class=""it-text"">amim</span>, and the door of repentance, <span class=""it-text"">sha’ar hateshuva</span>. They remain open even when other doors are closing.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 76,"<p class=""body"">Lamentations Rabba, a collection of midrashim on the book of Lamentations, is the source that tells us that the gates of repentance are always open even if the gates of prayer are about to close (3:44). Some doors shut, others stay open. In Berakhot, we find another talmudic basis for the <span class=""it-text"">Ne’ila</span> service.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 77,"<p class=""extract-first"">Rabbi Elazar said: From the day the Temple was destroyed, the heavenly gates of prayer were locked, as it says: “Though I would cry and plead, He shut out my prayer” (Lamentations 3:8). But even though the gates of prayer have been locked, the gates of tears have not been locked, as it is stated, “Hear my prayer, God. Give ear to my cry. To my tears do not be silent” (Psalms 39:13).<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Berakhot 32b.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 78,"<p class=""body-first"">We ask not that God see our tears but that God not be silent to our tears. We want God to be engaged in our sorrow, to show compassion when we are desperate, and we stand in front of a door that seems impossible to unlock.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 79,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik in his book <span class=""it-text"">Halakhic Man</span> recalls a moment when he stood with his father in the synagogue courtyard right before <span class=""it-text"">Ne’ila</span>. It was, in his words, a “fresh, clear day, one of the fine, almost delicate days of summer’s end, filled with sunshine and light” that was fast turning into night. His father turned to him and said, “This sunset differs from the ordinary sunsets, for with it forgiveness is bestowed upon us for our sins.” As the day changed to night, Rabbi Moses, his father, saw in it the transformation of a soul. At that moment, Rabbi Soloveitchik meditated on what was happening outside with what was happening inside:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 80,"<p class=""extract-first"">Yom Kippur and the forgiveness of sins merged and blended here with the splendor and beauty of the world and with the hidden lawfulness of the order of creation. The whole was transformed into one living, holy, cosmic phenomenon.<span class=""footnote-refe _idGenCharOverride-1"">&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i class=""footnotes""&gt;Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, Halakhic Man (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1984), 38.&lt;/i&gt;</span></p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 81,"<p class=""body-first"">Most of us are in the synagogue as the sun is setting. The fluorescent lighting removes us from the experience of sunset during <span class=""it-text"">Ne’ila</span>. But if we can look out a window or even step outside for a few minutes before our final prayers begin, we can see the sky carrying the lesson of transformation that we have been trying hard to achieve inside. Everything is turning. Darkness is approaching. The day is ending. We are still alive. We will make it through the fast. We will try again. The possibility of change never leaves us. We think of who we were when we stepped into <span class=""it-text"">Kol Nidrei</span> and who we are as <span class=""it-text"">Ne’ila</span> is closing. We are not the same.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 82,"<p class=""body"">We don’t have much time left. In a midrash, a <span class=""it-text"">bat kol</span> (heavenly voice) came down from the sky to tell Moses that he had only three hours left to live. Moses continued to debate God. Let me into the land of Israel. He listed all of his merits. He begged. He pleaded. And then the <span class=""it-text"">bat</span><span class=""it-text""> kol</span> returned, “Moses, you have only one hour left.” And Moses continued to debate God and complain about his fate. And then the <span class=""it-text"">bat kol</span> came down and said, “Moses, you have only fifteen minutes left.”</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 83,"<p class=""body"">Squandering the last hours justifying ourselves, we lose the time we thought we had. How are we going to spend the next fifteen minutes? The next half hour? The next hour? The next week? We can beg and plead and make excuses. We can use all of our energy to argue or complain. Or we can use that energy to radiate love, to get a little closer to the people we care about, to bring God into our lives, to make someone else’s life a little better. And we can do all this before the gates close.</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 84,"<p class=""sub-1-new-page"">Life Homework</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 85,"<p class=""sub-2-no-spc-b4"">Exercise 1:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 86,"<p class=""body-first-no-sp-b4"">Think of a place or a ritual that is exceptionally holy to you and that brings out your most transcendent self. How can you use it to inspire greater holiness in your life?</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 87,"<p class=""body"">Think about the activities you engage in and the time you spend nurturing your physical self through exercise, recreation, or rest. Reduce it to an approximate number of hours a week. Now think about activities or behavior you engage in that have a holy quality. Only include rituals like prayer or study if they contribute to your awareness or experience of holiness, not if they are done as rote or obligatory undertakings. Compare your findings. What did you learn about yourself?</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 88,"<p class=""sub-2"">Exercise 2:</p>"
Day Ten: Holiness 89,"<p class=""body-first-no-sp-b4"">Imagine a door that stands in front of you that is getting in the way of your success. Name a problem and visualize it as that door. Stand squarely in front of it. What would it take to open the door? That door is your gate of repentance. It is your <span class=""it-text"">Ne’ila</span>. Muster the strength to go through it. When you get to the other side, you will realize that it was just a door, a mere threshold into the self. You can cross the threshold.</p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 1,"<p class=""chapter-first""><span class=""First-Letter"">I</span><span class=""optical"">n </span>the last chapter of the talmudic tractate Yoma, our sages of old debated the merits of repentance and its limitations. What can teshuva change and what can it not change? In one particularly moving passage, different rabbis put forward noble statements about why teshuva is an incredible gift, usually based on a close reading of a biblical verse.</p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 2,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Hama bar Hanina began the great debate, held in Socratic style. “Great is repentance,” he believed, “for it brings healing to the world, as it is said: ‘I will heal their backsliding. I will love them freely’ (Hosea 14:5).” Through the act of teshuva, God is able to hold us up to our own best standard. When we find ourselves sliding back into a place we never wanted to go, we remind ourselves that we can change and that the change will bring inner healing to ourselves and the world. God loves us freely and unconditionally, but it is harder to feel that love when there is too much distance. <span class=""it-text"">Close the gap.</span></p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 3,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Levi observed: “Great is repentance, for it reaches up to the Throne of Glory, as it is said: ‘Return O Israel, unto the Lord, your God, for you have stumbled in your sin’ (Hosea 14:2).” Rabbi Levi took the verse literally. We return to the Lord. When we return, we create access to God. The remoteness that results from sin is abolished, leaving only intimacy with God. <span class=""it-text"">Reach higher.</span></p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 4,"<p class=""body"">Resh Lakish said, “Great is repentance, for because of it premeditated sins are accounted as mere errors, as it is said: ‘Return O Israel, unto the Lord, your God, for you have stumbled in your sin.’” Resh Lakish took the same verse as his esteemed colleague but interpreted the latter part rather than the former. Sinning is an act of stumbling. When we try to make up for the faltering path that sin leads us down, our sins are mistakes rather than intentional acts of self-destruction. <span class=""it-text"">Pick yourself up.</span></p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 5,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan: “Great is repentance, because it prolongs the years of a person, as it is said: ‘And when the wicked turns from his wickedness…he shall live’ (Ezekiel 33:19).”  Teshuva is an elixir of life. When people commit to change, they give themselves a new life and find possibilities that they formerly believed were closed to them. <span class=""it-text"">Open the </span><span class=""it-text"">door.</span></p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 6,"<p class=""body"">Rabbi Meir used to say: “Great is repentance, since even if only one person repents, the sins of the world are forgiven, as it is said: ‘I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely for My anger is turned away from him’ (Hosea 14:5).” Rabbi Meir read this verse carefully and noticed the odd change from the third person plural to the third person singular. “Their” is replaced in the end by “him.” Rabbi Meir understood that this implied that God forgives the entire nation when even one person does teshuva. As preposterous as it sounds, Rabbi Kook turned this passage’s meaning on its head in <span class=""it-text"">The Lights of Repentance</span>. God, he believed, would not forgive an entire universe if only one person changed his decadent or immoral ways. Rather, Rabbi Kook read this passage very personally: if one person repents then the whole world changes in his eyes. It is not that the world improves; it is that the person who changes adopts a new attitude and perspective. Objects of scorn and derision become less abhorrent. People and places associated with negativity take on a more positive spin. When we change, the world looks different to us. <span class=""it-text"">Look at the world</span><span class=""it-text""> anew.</span></p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 7,"<p class=""body"">If we close our eyes, we can almost imagine a study hall brimming with inspiring debate. No one is exclusively right in this debate, but no one is wrong either. The merits of any mitzva are subjective to the performer of that commandment. Each sage quoted in the Talmud felt an affinity for the mandate to repent, and each saw in the act of repentance a distinct advantage. The layering of each answer has a multiplier effect, helping us appreciate in all of its various ways the positive impact of authentic change.</p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 8,"<p class=""body"">As you look back on the past ten days, you may find yourself at the center of this ancient conversation. As each day progressed, you may have distilled your experience through Rabbi Hama bar Hanina’s lens. Teshuva is healing. You may have interpreted the verse in Hosea like Rabbi Levi; repentance helped you return to God or to a self you liked better than the self you were before the season began. Resh Lakish may have helped you look back on your own transgressions with mercy and compassion, helping you move them from intention to regrettable mistakes that can be repaired. You may feel more alive and thank Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani for his insight. You may engage in silent dialogue with Rabbi Meir and consider the ways that the world surrounding you has changed in these past ten days, not because it has changed but because you have.</p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 9,"<p class=""body"">Conversations like this one invite us into their pages. Stepping in, I invite you to write your own conclusion to this talmudic argument.</p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 10,"<p class=""body"">“Great is repentance, because…”</p>"
Epilogue: The Day After 11,"<p class=""body"">When you finish the sentence in your own words, you will be able to see just how much teshuva as an act of return takes place every day, not merely on one day or in one month or over a few holidays. We return and then we return again. We have to keep returning because we change, and the world around us changes. In a universe without stasis, we cannot be caught standing still. The majestic endeavor of discovering human purpose beckons each and every day. And every day, we are invited to respond to that call. <span class=""it-text"">Hineni</span>.
