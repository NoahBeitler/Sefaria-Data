Psalm 34/XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This psalm is an alphabetical acrostic. The English equiva-

alphabet. The Tetragrammaton appears in this psalm, as in Psalm 29,
eighteen times, the numerical equivalent of life.    /SC/XXJ.R./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. "Will be summoned to account"..."triumph over guilt"-
--the Hebrew verb is the same in both verses: /ITyeshamu...lo ye/UNshe/XXmu/XX. The
rendering of these phrases is meant to capture the paradoxical theological
and psychological implications of guilt: considered as a condition of
responsibility before God, the concept of guilt is an important cornerstone
of religious belief; considered as an emotion that can, sometimes inappro-
priately, lead a person into despair or self-hatred, a sense of guilt can some-
times be dangerous and wrong. Those who "triumph over" guilt master
the crippling effects of guilt as an emotion; they will, however, retain their
sense of right and wrong, and continue to hold themselves responsible
before God.    /SC/XXJ.R./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Psalm 90 could be called a wisdom psalm. Its message is
that the very eternity of God forces us to confront the shortness of human
life and our own mortality. The psalmist calls out for the wisdom "to assess
our days" and thus to gain an understanding heart. Facing mortality
squarely and honestly, the psalmist, with great poignancy, calls out for as
many joyous days as those we have experienced suffering and pain. The
human capacity to arise from suffering and experience joy again is one of
the greatest testimonies to GodÚs presence.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCN/XXOTE/XX. Psalm 90. çâÑåÄÑ ôâÄ Ñ/22éå Ñåâîö / A prayer of Moses, the man of
God--A number of psalms are traditionally ascribed to authors other than
David. This is the only one ascribed to Moses. The identification may rest
on the psalmistÚs extreme humility before God, the psalmÚs desertlike
mood, its stress on the nothingness of humanity and nature, and its plead-
ing on behalf of human beings in the face of divine wrath.    /SC/XXJ.R./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. ÖÅÖô òéÄöÖ / ÄãÉ Éí ôÖêÄ Å/22ö / You return a person unto dust.
You say: Return...--This couplet captures, with some irony, two
values of the word "return": physical return of the human being to dust
is suggested first, and the line that follows could allude to it, as well; or
GodÚs call could mean, "Repent, do /ITteshuvah/XX!" When the word appears
again, some verses later, its meaning is deepened further: "Return, /SCF/XXOUN-
TAIN /XXO/XXF /XXL/XXIGHT/XX!"--here, the prayer calls upon God to return from hiding
or from anger, and be reconciled with humanity. Human and divine repen-
tance mirror each other. The psalmist prays for this mutual return./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The "you" of this psalm is the worshipper, who comes into
GodÚs presence seeking assurance of GodÚs protection in the travails of life.
The worshipper and God begin the psalm in vastly different positions.
God is /ITElyon/XX, the Most High, while the worshipper is like a small bird
that needs to be saved "from the fowlerÚs trap." The worshipper needs
shelter and protection, which God, "an encircling shield," can provide.
But these polarized positions change in the imagination as the psalm pro-
ceeds. Others may be subject to the terrors of night and the scourge of
noonday, but under GodÚs protection, the worshipper walks invulnerably
through life, safe from enemies and disease. At the end of the description,
the worshipper becomes one of the mighty beings on the planet, trampling
on lions and pythons. And God is not distant, but quite near at hand,
speaking of being with the worshipper, answering each and every call. The
voices that serve as intermediaries between the worshipper and God para-
doxically convey the notion that we need no intermediary when we call
on God.    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The function of angels in the Bible was primarily that of messengers as
reflected in the Hebrew term /ITmalah/±/XX. Though the Bible does refer to other
kinds of angels, their function is quite sketchy. In the second Temple per-
iod, the lore about angels grew quite rapidly. At several points the Hebrew
liturgy utilizes biblical excerpts in ways that reflect the later understanding
of angels. This is particularly the case in the three forms of /ITKedushah/XX found
in the Shabbat and Festival morning service.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR
