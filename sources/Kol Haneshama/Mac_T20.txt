/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The images of the /ITShiviti/XX can provide a spiritual entry
point and aid in concentration./PR

/PR

This /ITShiviti/XX is built around the liturgical themes of creation, revelation,
and redemption. The vertical oval is associated with womenÚs procreative
power, which echoes divine creation. The overall shape of the /ITShiviti/XX is
inspired by Eastern meditation mandalas, which often include a circular
image of the rose or lotus. The opening flower is meant to suggest the
gradual revelation of the perfection and mystery of creation. To the open-
ing petals seven gateways are added. There is one for each of the patriarchs
and matriarchs to remind us that each person finds his or her own path to
God. No two journeys are alike./PR

/PR

At the heart of the /ITShiviti/XX is the Tetragrammaton, which is the most holy
name of God. It is surrounded by petal/archways with other names of the
Divine. A second tetragrammaton crowns the /ITShiviti/XX, with Jerusalem, a
symbol of redemption, rising from the top./PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. Acknowledging our ancestors reminds us that what we are is
shaped by who they were. Just as an acorn is shaped by the oak that pre-
ceded it and yet gives birth to a tree uniquely its own, so we are shaped
by our ancestors yet give rise to a Judaism all our own.    /SC/XXR.M.S./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Throughout the centuries the pursuit of meaningful com-
munal prayer has led to variations in the /ITAmidah/XX. These variations reflect
the attitudes and beliefs of different prayer communities. In the ongoing
pursuit of meaningful prayer for a Reconstructionist prayer community,
changes have been introduced into this /ITAmidah/XX, most notably in the first
two of the seven /ITberah/±ot/XX which comprise the Shabbat /ITAmidah/XX. The first
/ITberah/±ah/XX has been expanded to include the matriarchs along with the patri-
archs as exemplars of GodÚs presence in human lives. By concentrating on
examples of healing forces and life-sustaining rains, the second /ITberah/±ah/XX
acknowledges God as the power that sustains life. The traditional emphasis
on GodÚs ability to resurrect the dead has been replaced here by a celebra-
tion of God as the power that sustains all life.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

Hebrew phrase can also be translated, "who remembers the love of par-
ents." The legacy each generation gives to its children inevitably contains
within it pain and hurt, a sense of inadequacy and of task unfulfilled. Some
children are hurt when parents are taken from them too early, others by
parents who did not know how to show their love. We say that God
"remembers the love of parents;" God is the one who sees to it that the
love as well is remembered, even when parents are unable to transmit it./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This version of the first /ITberah/±ah/XX in the /ITAmidah/XX includes the
matriarchs as well as the patriarchs. The phrase "help of Sarah," /ITezrat sarah/XX,
comes from a Hebrew root (òÜí) which can mean either "save" or "be
strong". This parallels the meaning of /ITmagen/XX / shield. The biblical text says
that Abraham experienced God as a shield and that Sarah experienced God
as a helper. Their experience and the example of their lives can enrich our
own. Just as Abraham and Sarah found the strength to face the unknown
physical and spiritual dangers of their journey, so we seek to find the cour-
age and inspiration to meet the challenges of own time./PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. This prayer affirms that God will appear, "from your dwelling--
place...." Where is GodÚs place? God is called /ITMakom/XX, Place itself. We
affirm, then, the possibility of GodÚs emergence from GodÚs very self.
Some of the rabbis also understood a spark of the divine to be present in
everything. To appear "from your dwelling place" thus could also mean
that we hope to see that which is godly within each thing. Together these
interpretations suggest that we pray that God emerge out of the divine
spark in each thing in order to manifest that this world is GodÚs Place./PR
