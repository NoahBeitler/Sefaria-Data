/SCC/XXOMMENTARY./XX The blessing immediately following the
Shema deals with the theme of divine redemption. The present text, a
rewritten version, includes reference to the Holocaust, from which there
was no redemption, and return to Zion, a fulfillment of IsraelÚs ancient
dream. The same divine spirit that gave Israel the courage to seek freedom
from Egypt in ancient times inspired those who fought for IsraelÚs freedom
in our own day. At the same time, this version omits those portions of the
text that glory in the enemyÚs fall or see in God a force for vengeance.
All humans are GodÚs beloved children, as were the Egyptians who
drowned at the sea.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

Whenever human rulers usurp divine authority, and exploit the
people, those tyrantsÚ hearts are hardened, their own arrogance

unrighteous powers rise up to destroy us./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Two beautiful /ITberah/±ot/XX complete the liturgical framework of
the Shema in the evening service. The first of these is called
/ITGeÚulah/XX--"Redemption." Recalling the Exodus from Egypt, it thematically
echoes the third paragraph of the Shema. Moreover, it identifies the sover-
eign God, named in the ShemaÚs credo, as the power that freed Israel from
slavery. Its vivid, here-and-now recollection of the escape from Egyptian
bondage invites and challenges Israel to claim the redemption as a personal
experience in each generation and to hear echoes of that ancient triumph
over tyranny in each modern-day struggle for freedom, in every attempt
to move toward the messianic future.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY./XX This siddur reinstates reference to the splitting of the sea
as a sign of GodÚs redeeming power. The earlier Reconstructionist
prayerbook omitted that reference because of its emphasis on supernatural
intervention. As myth, however, the ancient tale of wonder underscores
the sense of daily miracle in our lives. Even those of us who cannot affirm
a God who intervenes in the natural process, and thus cannot accept the
literal meaning of the tale, can appreciate its human message. According
to the midrash, the sea did not split until one Israelite, Nah/±shon ben
Aminadav, had the courage to walk upright into the water. Perhaps it was
the divine spirit in Nah/±shon, rather than the magic of MosesÚs wand, that
caused the sea to split.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITHashkivenu/XX--"Help us lie down [in peace]"--is the final
prescribed part of the Shema. It recalls the Shema by expressing the hope
that we will "lie down...in peace" and "rise again...to life." An extension
of /ITEmet VeÚemunah, Hashkivenu/XX joins the vivid recollection of past redemp-
tion to a prayer for present protection and future peace. By calling God
"guardian" and "protector" but also "redeemer," Israel recognizes new
dimensions of the power that makes for freedom. The final acknowledg-
ment of God as the one who "spreads the sukkah of peace over us, over
Israel, and over Jerusalem" conjures up the now familiar image of Shabbat
as a foretaste of that future time when Israel, its people, and its holy city
will dwell in peace. This blessing is unique to the evening service. Perhaps
responding to the cold, dark uncertainty of night, we invoke GodÚs dwell-
ing of peace.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. Enable us, God, to behold meaning in the chaos of life about
us and purpose in the chaos of life within us. Deliver us from the sense

behold things in their proper proportions and see life in its wholeness and
its holiness.    /SC/XXM.M.K. (ADAPTED)/XX/PR

future of the Jewish people. Jerusalem, in the biblical vision, will become

sions by deleting the series of petitions for protection. Such petition is con-
sidered inappropriate on Shabbat and Festivals, days of fulfillment and
appreciation for the many blessings we have. Shabbat itself is a sukkah of
peace. We pray that real and complete peace be the lot of Israel and Jerusa-
lem, so torn by strife in recent memory. Our tradition sees Jerusalem as
the center of the world. Creation began there, according to the rabbis. So
may the peace that begins there radiate forth and bless all earthÚs peoples.
The peace of Jerusalem, the "heart of the world," is also the peace of every
human heart.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR
