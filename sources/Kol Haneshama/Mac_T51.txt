Rabbi Levi Yitzh/±ak of Berdichev comments that the true
miracle of the Exodus, the "great" miracle, in fact took place on
the tenth of Nisan, not later. When Israel decided that they
would slaughter sheep (which according to tradition were gods
in Egypt) without regard for what their Egyptian taskmasters
would say or do to them, their liberation had begun. That God
can wreak plagues, split the sea, and all the rest--these are no
source of surprise to the person of faith. But IsraelÚs courage to
defy the Egyptians--that is truly worthy of being called
miraculous./PR

Rabbi Nah/±man of Bratzlav comments on "and they made no
provisions for the way": "When you are about to leave
Egypt--/ITany/XX Egypt--do not stop to think `But how will I earn a
living out there?...Ú One who stops to `make provisions for the
wayÚ will never get out of Egypt." A comment to be repeated
annually for college seniors, midlife-crisis confronters, and all
the rest of us./PR

How strange that we should begin the /ITseder/XX with the statement
"This year we are slaves!" The point is, according to one H/±asidic
reading, that while we recognize our current enslavements, we
also recognize the great distance we have traversed from
Egyptian bondage to the sort of slavery we feel in our current
lives. Had someone come to us while we were in Egypt and said,
"You know, someday you and your children will be telling this
tale as though it were all in the past," we would hardly have
believed him. See how far we have come! And for those of us
who have gone this far in the path of liberation--remembering
that we once were carriers of bricks and mortar--nothing in the
liberation that lies ahead should seem impossible to us./PR

Perhaps for the thousandth time, the Jewish committee in
Buchenwald was holding a meeting on the question: Where to?
A Polish Jew, a German, a Czech, a Hungarian--each faced the
same burning problem: Where should the few surviving Jews
of Buchenwald go? How could we ever have believed that at the
end of the war the surviving Jews would have no more worries,
that everything would be fine! The world, we had thought,
would welcome our few survivors with open arms! We, the first
victims of the Nazis. They would love us!/PR

/PR

Quickly enough, we saw that the world had other things on its
mind than Jewish suffering. So where to?/PR

/PR

Comrade Posnansky put forth an idea: into our own kibbutz. To
build a group of BuchenwaldÚs youth, and find a farm where we
could prepare for Palestine. A wonderful idea. There would be
no lack of candidates for the kibbutz, for energy was
reawakening in the survivors and seeking an outlet./PR

/PR

From that idea sprang Kibbutz Buchenwald./PR

/PR

After several days of coming and going, the Jewish committee
in Buchenwald possessed a document from the American
Military Government which gave it the right to make use, for
a long term, of the township farm of Eggendorf, near
Blankenheim./PR

/PR

June 3, 1945--Here we are, the first few comrades, sitting on
a truck that is taking us away from Buchenwald. Finally, the
Buchenwald chapter is ended. The concrete road takes us away
from the barracks, the watchtowers, the SS quarters; on this
straight road, which turns neither to right nor to left, we head
for our new life. We are all determined to follow this road to a
place of our own, a Jewish settlement where we can put our
energies into something that will belong only to us, a place
where we can live for the future. This road must take us to
Palestine./PR

...at P.S. 125..., as soon as October was folded back on the
calendar, we began paying intense, if somewhat baffled, homage
to the glories of Thanksgiving./PR

/PR

Most of us were the children of immigrants from Vilna or
Minsk or Odessa, who rarely budged from Brooklyn, and we
had to sing loud our praises for the gathering of the harvest and
the prodigal bounty of the land as the trolley cars clanged by
under the windows. Day after day...we devoted ourselves to that
old American holiday first conceived, we were told, in a bleak
place called New England, by the Pilgrims, also known as
ancestors. These ancestors spoke English without an accent, did
not have to pass through Ellis Island when they reached the
golden land, and had come to these shores to escape from
religious persecution..../PR

/PR

We labored intently...making the first Thanksgiving--the huge
Pilgrim family, at an enormously long table, in the clearing they
had courageously hacked out of the ominous New England
forest. With crayons and paints we smeared a lavish feast..../PR

/PR

There was a song we sang only in November--"We gather
together and ask the LordÚs blessing. He chastens and hastens
His will to make known." We sang it with loud and cheerful
assurance as Miss Johnson thumped away on a piano....Like
Christmas carols...this Thanksgiving hymn had the lure of the
forbidden. I would come home on November afternoons, my
face hectically pink from the autumn air and the grandeur of
Thansgiving, and sing "We Gather Together" until my mother,
who would be working on a dress for me or one of her
customers and never seemed to be listening, would suddenly
hear "the LordÚs blessing" and exclaim, "What kind of a song
is this for a Jewish girl to sing! Stop this minute, itÚs not nice
somebody should hear you."/PI/PR

from school every afternoon...."But Mama, /ITwhy/XX canÚt we have
turkey for Thanksgiving like everybody else?"/PR

eyes from the sewing machine. "The Feins eat turkey

I knew it was useless to argue. I knew it before I began to try.
But something urged me, every November, to try just this once
more. How easy it seemed, how easy and beautiful and right, as
I pictured it, mooning in my room....the round table in the
living room swelled with the two leaves we dragged out from
behind the sofa only at Passover time....At four in the afternoon,
all the guests would assemble....This day would differ from
other days because on Thanksgiving my brother and I would be
glad to see our cousins, who for a change would not say, "What
do you have to take dopey violin lessons for?" And after we had
all kissed each other sweetly, we would sit down, with cheerful
smiles, around the jolly table set exactly the way they showed
in the /ITLadiesÚ Home Journal/XX. After we sang "We Gather
Together," my mother would march in from the kitchen at just
the right moment, holding the enormous, steaming brown bird
aloft on a silver platter, which she placed reverently in front of
my father, poised and ready with a carving knife handed down,
of course, by ancestors. Then Papa would begin to carve with
magnificent effortless skill, an art taught him by his father who
had learned it from /IThis/XX father..../PR
