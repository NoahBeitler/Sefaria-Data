When the people of Israel crossed through the Red Sea, they
witnessed a great miracle. Some say it was the greatest miracle
that ever happened. On that day they saw a sight more awesome
than all the visions of the prophets combined. The sea split and
the waters stood like great walls, while Israel escaped to freedom
on the distant shore. Awesome. But not for everyone./PR

/PR

Two people, Reuven and Shimon, hurried along among the
crowd crossing through the sea. They never once looked up.
They noticed only that the ground under their feet was still a
little muddy--like a beach at low tide./PR

/PR

"Yucch!" said Reuven, "thereÚs mud all over this place!"/PR

/PR

"Bleecch!" said Shimon, "I have muck all over my feet!"/PR

/PR

"This is terrible," answered Reuven. "When we were slaves in
Egypt, we had to make our bricks out of mud, just like this!"/PR

/PR

"Yeah," said Shimon. "ThereÚs no difference between being a
slave in Egypt and being free here."/PR

/PR

And so it went, Reuven and Shimon whining and complaining
all the way to freedom. For them there was no miracle. Only
mud. Their eyes were closed. They might as well have been
asleep./PR

/KAThe Wolf and the Dog/XX/PR

Once there was a wolf who was very skinny because he never
had anything much to eat. One day as he was looking for food
he met a dog. The dog said, "What are you looking for?"/PR

/PR

And the wolf said, "Food."/PR

/PR

The dog laughed and said, "I donÚt have to look for food. My
master gives me food and a place to sleep. I lead a good easy life
and IÚm taking a walk."/PI/PR

The wolf said, "May I come home with you?"/PR

The dog said, "Sure, my master would like to have you."/PR

/PR

Just then the wolf saw the mark on the dogÚs neck. "What is
that mark on your neck?" he asked./PR

/PR

"Oh, thatÚs just the collar chain I wear during the day. YouÚll
get used to it."/PR

/PR

But the wolf stopped and ran in the opposite direction. Calling
over his shoulder to the dog, he said, "You may have your good
food. As for me, IÚll keep my freedom."/PR

/PR

And the wolf never came there again./PR

/PR

Moral: Freedom having hardships is better than being in chains./PR

Anne Frank was a young girl in Amsterdam, Holland during the
terrible days of Nazi occupation./PR

/PR

Two weeks before she died--one of the six million Jews who
perished in the Holocaust--she wrote the following words in
her diary:/PR

/PR

ItÚs really a wonder that I havenÚt dropped all my ideals, because
they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep
them, because in spite of everything I still believe that people
are really good at heart. I simply canÚt build up my hopes on a
foundation of confusion, misery and death. I see the world
gradually being turned into a wilderness. I hear approaching
thunder....I can feel the suffering of millions, and yet, if I look
up into the heavens, I think that it will all come out right, that
this cruelty will end, and that peace and tranquility will return
again. In the meantime, I must hold on to my ideals for perhaps
the day will come when I shall be able to carry them out./PR

The impulse to evil is like one who runs about the world with

Certain sages include repentance among the entities created
before the world itself. The implication of this remarkable
statement is that repentance is a universal primordial
phenomenon; in such a context it has two meanings. One is that
it is embedded in the root structure of the world; the other, that
before we were created, we were given the possibility of
changing the course of our lives. In this latter sense repentance
is the highest expression of our capacity to choose freely--it is
a manifestation of the divine in human. By repenting, we can
extricate ourselves from the binding web of our lives, from the
chain of causality that otherwise compels us to follow a path of
no return./PR
