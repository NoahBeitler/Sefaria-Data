/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Various editions of the prayerbook offer different orders of
the morning blessings. Here the first blessing is that on awakening. Then
comes a blessing on the first sounds of dawn, followed by thanksgiving
for the return of waking consciousness ("who establishes the dry land upon
the waters"), and then the blessing on opening our eyes and seeing our
world, freshly created with the dawn, around us. The cycle is completed
with the final blessing "who gives strength to the weary" as we prepare
to begin our day.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This sequence of blessings is the central portion of /ITBirh/±ot
Hashah/±ar/XX. It was designed by the talmudic sages to celebrate such acts of
awakening as focusing the eyes, sitting up, stretching, standing, etc. The
transference of these blessings to the public worship service (ninth cen-
tury) disengaged the blessing and the particular act of awakening with
which it was joined. In their public setting the morning blessings took on
a new level of meaning. Removed from the acts of awakening, individual
activities became metaphors for godly action. The blessing "who clothes
the naked" ceased to be a pointed acknowledgment of personal possessions
and personal protection. Instead it became a celebration of God as the
power that prompts the care and nurturance of humankind. The blessing
"who raises the lowly" ceased to be a blessing over the renewal of physical
mobility and became a blessing of the divine presence manifest in actions
that raise the bodies and elevate the spirits of those who are low.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The familiar introductory formula for blessings including
the phrase /ITmeleh/± haÚolam/XX / sovereign of the world, was adopted by the rab-
bis during the talmudic era and universally accepted by later Jews. Substi-
tuting another rabbinic phrase, /ITh/±ey haÚolamim/XX / life of all the worlds,
expresses the idea that as Judaism continues to evolve, alternatives to the
ancient metaphor of God as divine ruler should emerge. This alternative
blessing formulation may be used throughout the siddur by those who pre-
fer it, just as the traditional /ITmeleh/± haÚolam/XX may be substituted here.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. The "worlds" to which /ITh/±ey haÚolamim/XX refers may be the many
universes that each of us inhabits, the vast spaces that surround our world,
or the infinite depths that fill the human heart. We proclaim that God is
the single flow of life that inhabits and unifies them all.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. We give thanks that we are restored whole and healthy to con-
sciousness and to an orderly universe. That is why, in the second blessing,
we give thanks that, when we stepped out of bed our feet encountered not
the watery chaos which preceded creation, but the solid earth which God
spread over the waters. The daily emergence from unconsciousness
reminds us of our fragility as human creatures and our need for support
and care.    /SC/XXR.A./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. For whom do we recite blessings? If God is beyond blessing, then
we must be reciting them for ourselves. Each /ITberah/±ah/XX urges us to avoid
taking the world for granted. Each contains a vision of the creative or
redemptive power in the world. Jewish tradition teaches that living up to
our heritage as beings created /ITbetzelem elohim/XX, in the image of God, requires
us to "imitate God." Thus each /ITberah/±ah/XX can teach us something about liv-
ing our lives in consonance with the divine. Blessings tell us not so much
about a God "out there somewhere," they teach us how to make manifest
the godly in ourselves.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

we are. In the rigidly stratified society in which these prayers originated,
people were less conscious of identity than of status. Thus, the original
forms of these prayers expressed the thankfulness of the most privileged
members of the community--free Jewish males--that they did not have
the less privileged status of women, slaves, or non-Jews./PR

The blessings we now use affirm that since we embody the divine image,
we are all intrinsically valuable. To degrade or enslave others is to deface
the image of God. We were created free just as our creator is free. We are
capable of choice, of invention and of transformation in our lives and in
our world. We also give thanks for our particular identity as Jews. God
who creates our common humanity, also cherishes human diversity. Each
people is unique and precious.    /SC/XXR.A./XX/PR

My God, the soul you gave to me is pure. You have created it,
you shaped it, and you breathed it into me, and you preserve it
deep inside of me. And someday you will take it from me,
restoring it to everlasting life./PI/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The word /ITneshamah/XX, which means both "breath" and
"soul," provides a linguistic connection between the blessings for body and
soul. The blessing for the soul uses the vocabulary of the Creation story,
especially Genesis 2:6, which describes how God created the human form
and then animated it with the breath of life. Hence, the language of cele-
brating each awakening carries an echo of the primal joining of human
form to life force. Every awakening is nothing less than a rehearsal of the
mystery of creation./PR

/PR

The traditional version of the blessing for the soul acknowledges the daily
renewal of life as a recollection of creation and also as a foretaste of resur-
rection. The current version concludes instead by acknowledging God as
the power that renews life each day.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

text says, "and restore it to me in the future to come." The text in our

We gratefully acknowledge God as the source of life itself and of the con-
stant renewal of our spirit. The traditional formula of this blessing, refer-
ring to the future resurrection of the dead, has been emended. As Recon-
structionists, we accept both the finality of death and the infinite
wondrousness of life. Our religion is about the balancing of these two real-
ities, neither of which may be allowed to negate the other.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR
