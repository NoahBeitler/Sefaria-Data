Praises to God, who rested from all labors of Creation! On the
seventh day did God ascend, returning to the throne of glory.
With splendor God adorned the day of rest, calling Shabbat a
time of pleasure. This is the distinction of the seventh day, for
on it the divine one ceased from all creationÚs work. The seventh
day itself offers its praise, calling out "a psalm of the Shabbat:
It is good to give thanks to /SCT/XXHE /XXE/XXTERNAL/XX..." Therefore, let all
GodÚs creatures offer laudatory blessing! Praise, appreciation,
and greatness may they give to God, the sovereign creator of all
things, who in great holiness has given an inheritance of rest
unto the people Israel, upon Shabbat, the holy day. May your
name, /SCD/XXEAR /XXO/XXNE/XX, our God, be declared holy; and your memory,
our sovereign, be magnified both in the skies above and on the
earth below. Be blessed, redeeming power, in celebration of your
handiwork, and for the luminaries that you made. Let all declare
your greatness!/PR

May you be blessed, our rock, our sovereign, our champion,
creator of the holy beings, and let your name be praised
eternally, majestic one, the fashioner of ministering angels. All
of them are standing in the heavensÚ highest realms, and giving
voice, in awestruck unison, to words of the living God, the
sovereign of all worlds. All of them adored, all brilliant in light,
all great and mighty--all of them perform, in awe and dread,
the will of their creator. And all open their mouths in holiness
and purity. With song and melody, they bless, they praise, they
magnify, they raise aloft, and sanctify, and proclaim

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This passage pictures an angelic chorus singing GodÚs
praises. In Jewish tradition, angels have had a long and varied
history--messengers warning Abraham of SodomÚs destruction, the heav-
enly choir of Isaiah, the TalmudÚs host of heavenly functionaries, the
impersonal forces of medieval philosophy, the presences of the Kabbalists.
The tradition leaves ample room for each generation to understand angels
as it will, whether as natural forces or revealing moments in our lives, the
divine in the people we meet, or manifestations of the goodness in our
world or in the inner workings of the human heart.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

Abounding is the love that God has shown the house of Israel
in giving us the Torah. Through Torah we have come to know
the power of righteousness. Truly your word has been our life
and the length of our days, enabling us to outlive powerful
nations that have sought to enslave or destroy us. For it has
taught us to put our trust not in force and violence, in aggression
and domination, but in justice and truth, in kindness and
compassion. Torah has helped curb in us the lust and greed,
vindictiveness and cruelty that mar human life. It has filled us
with a yearning for a world permeated with love, in which
people live in peace and security, in mutual loyalty and
friendship. It has inspired us with the faith that the ultimate
destiny of humanity is to achieve the triumph of
righteousness./PR

Therefore we will not despair even in lifeÚs darkest moments,
for we possess in Torah the token of GodÚs love. May our hearts
be ever open to love! With grateful awareness of all the kindness
and good will in the world, let us reach out to others. Then,
whatever befalls us in life, we shall not feel forlorn or forsaken.
May you never withdraw your love from us! Blessed are you,
our God, who has shown eternal love to the people of Israel./PR

With an abounding love, you love us, /SCN/XXURTURER/XX, our God;
with great compassion do you care for us. Our source, our
sovereign, just as our ancestors placed their trust in you, and you
imparted to them laws of life, so be gracious to us, too, and teach
us. Our fount, our loving parent, caring one, be merciful with
us, and place into our hearts ability to understand, to see, to hear,
to learn, to teach, to keep, to do, and to uphold with love all
that we study of your Torah./PI/PR

ÑÅò ÑÅÑÄ / With an abounding love, you love us. /ITAhavah Rabah/XX may be
called the quintessentially Jewish prayer. In boundless love for Israel, God
gives the greatest gift imaginable: teachings that will help us to live. What
more could we want from the loving parent, combining attributes of both
father and mother, who here becomes the compassionate teacher, sharing
the gift of true knowledge with children who have become disciples? We
pray that we may have the open and understanding heart to receive these
teachings, to make them real by our deeds, and to pass them on to others.
This is our response to GodÚs love: a commitment to study, to live the life
of Torah, and to carry it forward to future generations.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

We learn of our own significance through the love that is freely offered
to us first by parents and later by others as well. We learn our ultimate
worth in this love, which is rooted in the divine love. This is truly essen-

others, how to do the divine bidding. Thus loving and learning are insep-
arable parts of our tie to the divine.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

Enlighten us with your Torah, cause our hearts to cling to your
mitzvot. Make our hearts one, to love your name and be in awe
of it. Keep us from shame, and from humiliation, and from
stumbling, today and always. For we have trusted in your holy,
great, and awesome name. May we be glad, rejoicing in your
saving power, and may you reunite our people from all corners
of the earth, leading us proudly independent to our land. For
you are the redeeming God and have brought us near to your
great name, to offer thanks to you, and lovingly declare your
unity. Blessed are you, /SCA/XXBUNDANT /XXO/XXNE/XX, who lovingly cares for
your people Israel./PR
