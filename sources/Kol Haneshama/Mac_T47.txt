The essence of the Jewish conception of life seems to me to lie
in an affirmative attitude to the life of all creation. The life of
the individual has meaning only insofar as it aids in making the
life of every living thing nobler and more beautiful. Life is
sacred--that is to say, it is the supreme value, to which all other
values are subordinate. The hallowing of the supra-individual
life brings in its train a reverence for everything spiritual--a
particularly characteristic feature of the Jewish tradition./PR

/PR

But the Jewish tradition also contains something else, something
which finds splendid expression in many of the Psalms, namely
a sort of intoxicated joy and amazement at the beauty and
grandeur of this world, of which humankind can just form a
faint notion. It is the feeling from which true scientific research
draws its spiritual substance, but which also seems to find
expression in leafy trees and the crash of waves./PR

Albert Einstein/XX/PR

/KAIn No Way/XX/PR

I am of the family of the universe, and with all of us together
I do not fear being alone; I can reach out and touch a rock or a
hand or dip my feet in water. Always there is somebody close
by, and when I speak, I am answered by a planeÚs roar or the
birdÚs whistling or the voices of others in conversation far apart
from me. When I lie down to sleep, I am in the company of
the dark and the stars./PR

/PR

Breathe to me, sheep in the meadow. Sun and moon, my father
and my fatherÚs brother, kiss me on the brow with your light.
My sister, earth, holds me up to be kissed. Sun and moon, I smile
at you both and spread my arms in affection and lay myself down
at full length for the earth to know I love it too and am never
to be separated from it. In no way shall death part us./PR

Every part of this earth is sacred. Every shining pine needle,
every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every clearing
and humming insect is holy. We are part of the earth and it is
part of us. The perfumed flowers are our sisters; the deer, the
horse, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests,
the juices in the meadows, the body heat of the pony, and
people--all belong to the same family..../PR

This shining water that moves in the streams and rivers is not
just water but the blood of our ancestors. If we sell you land,
you must remember that it is sacred, and you must teach your
children that it is sacred and that each ghostly reflection in the
clear water of the lakes tells of events and memories...The
waterÚs murmur is the voice of my fatherÚs father./PR

The rivers are our brothers, they quench our thirst. The rivers
carry our canoes, and feed our children. If we sell you our land,
you must remember, and teach your children, that the rivers are
our brothers and yours, and you must henceforth give the rivers
the kindness you would give any brother./PR

/PR

You must teach your children that the ground beneath their feet
is the ashes of our grandparents. So that they will respect the
land, tell your children that the earth is rich with the lives of
our kin. Teach your children...that the earth is our mother.
Whatever befalls the earth befalls the children of the earth. If
we spit upon the ground, we spit upon ourselves./PR

the earth. All things are connected. We are kin after all..../PR
