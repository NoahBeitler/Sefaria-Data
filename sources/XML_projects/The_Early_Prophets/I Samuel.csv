I Samuel 1:1,"Now there was a man from Ramatayim in Tzofim, from the highlands of Efrayim;
his name was Elkana son of Yeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Tzuf, an Efrayimite."
I Samuel 1:2,"He had two wives:
the name of one was Hanna/Grace, while the name of the second was Peninna/Pearl;
now Peninna had children, but Hanna had no children."
I Samuel 1:3,"And that man used to go up from his town, from year to year,
to bow down and to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, at Shilo
—Eli’s two sons, Hofni and Pin’has, priests to Y<small>HWH</small>, were there."
I Samuel 1:4,"Now it was, one day,
that Elkana was sacrificing,
—he would give to Peninna his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, portions,"
I Samuel 1:5,"but to Hanna he would give a double portion,
for [it was] Hanna he loved,
although Y<small>HWH</small> had closed up her womb."
I Samuel 1:6,"And her rival-wife would provoke her with provocation, for the sake of making-her-complain,
for Y<small>HWH</small> had closed up her womb;"
I Samuel 1:7,"and thus he would do, year after year:
whenever she would go up to the House of God, thus would she provoke her—
… and she wept and would not eat,"
I Samuel 1:8,"so Elkana her husband said to her:
Hanna, why are you weeping?
Why don’t you eat?
And why is your heart in such ill-humor?
Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
I Samuel 1:9,"Hanna arose after eating at Shilo, and after drinking
—now Eli the priest was sitting on a throne by the doorpost of the great-hall of Y<small>HWH</small>—"
I Samuel 1:10,"and she was bitter of feelings,
so she prayed to Y<small>HWH</small>, while she wept, yes, wept;"
I Samuel 1:11,"she vowed a vow, and said:
O Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High,
if you will see, yes, see the affliction of your maidservant,
and will bear me in mind and not forget your maidservant,
and will give your maidservant seed of men,
then I will give him to Y<small>HWH</small> all the days of his life:
no razor shall go up on his head!"
I Samuel 1:12,"Now it was, as she multiplied her praying in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
that Eli was watching her mouth:"
I Samuel 1:13,"now Hanna, she was speaking in her heart,
only her lips were moving, but her voice could not be heard—
so Eli took her for a drunkard."
I Samuel 1:14,"Eli said to her:
How long will you be drunk?
Put away your wine from you!"
I Samuel 1:15,"But Hanna answered and said:
No, my lord,
a woman hardened of spirit am I.
Wine and beer I have not drunk,
but I have been pouring out my soul in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Samuel 1:16,"Do not consider your maidservant a base woman,
for it is out of my great anxiety and my being provoked [that] I have spoken until now."
I Samuel 1:17,"Eli answered and said: Go in peace,
and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have requested of him."
I Samuel 1:18,"She said:
May your handmaid find favor in your eyes.
The woman went on her way, and she ate,
and her face was no longer [sad] on her."
I Samuel 1:19,"They started-early in the morning:
they bowed down in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
then they returned, and came back to their house in Rama.
And Elkana knew Hanna his wife,
and Y<small>HWH</small> kept her in mind."
I Samuel 1:20,"So it was, at the turning of days,
that Hanna conceived and gave birth to a son;
she called his name: Shemuel/The One From God,
meaning: from Y<small>HWH</small> I requested him."
I Samuel 1:21,"And the man Elkana went up, along with all his household,
to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> the yearly sacrifice, and his vow-offering,"
I Samuel 1:22,"but Hanna did not go up,
for she said to her husband:
… until the lad is weaned—
then I will bring him,
that he may be seen in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
he is to stay there forever."
I Samuel 1:23,"Elkana her husband said to her:
Do whatever is good in your eyes:
stay until you have weaned him—
only: may Y<small>HWH</small> fulfill his word!
So the woman stayed behind and nursed her son, until she had weaned him."
I Samuel 1:24,"She brought him up with her, when she had weaned him,
with a three-year-old bull and an <i>efa</i> of flour, and a skin of wine,
and brought him to the House of Y<small>HWH</small> at Shilo,
though the lad was [just] a lad."
I Samuel 1:25,"They slaughtered the bull,
and then they brought the lad to Eli."
I Samuel 1:26,"She said:
Please, my lord, as you yourself live, my lord:
I am the woman who was standing beside you here, to pray to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 1:27,"It was for this lad that I prayed,
and Y<small>HWH</small> has granted my request that I requested of him!"
I Samuel 1:28,"So I now lend-him-on-request to Y<small>HWH</small>;
all the days that he lives he is lent-on-request/<i>sha’ul</i> to Y<small>HWH</small>.
And they bowed down there to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 2:1,"And Hanna prayed, she said:
My heart swells because of Y<small>HWH</small>,
my horn is raised because of Y<small>HWH</small>;
my mouth is wide-with-boasting over my enemies,
for I rejoice in your deliverance!"
I Samuel 2:2,"There is no one holy like Y<small>HWH</small>,
indeed, no one beside you,
there is no rock like our God!"
I Samuel 2:3,"Do not speak so high, so high [and mighty],
letting your mouth run free,
for a god all-knowing is Y<small>HWH</small>,
by him are actions measured."
I Samuel 2:4,"The bow of the mighty is shattered,
but the stumblers are girded with strength."
I Samuel 2:5,"Those once-sated must hire themselves out for bread,
but those once-hungry will endure forever.
The barren one has given birth to seven,
while the one [with] many sons is dried up."
I Samuel 2:6,"Y<small>HWH</small> brings-death and bestows-life,
brings down to Sheol and brings up."
I Samuel 2:7,"Y<small>HWH</small> makes-poor and makes-rich,
brings low and, yes, lifts up."
I Samuel 2:8,"He raises the needy from the dust,
lifts the destitute from the dunghill,
to seat them with the noble ones,
and a throne of glory he has them inherit.
For Y<small>HWH</small>’s are the molten-pillars of the earth,
he has set the world upon them."
I Samuel 2:9,"The feet of his loyal ones he guards,
but the wicked moan in darkness—
for not by might does a man prevail."
I Samuel 2:10,"Y<small>HWH</small> shatters those opposing him,
from the heavens he thunders against them.
Y<small>HWH</small> judges to the limits of the earth;
may he give power to his king,
and lift up the horn of his anointed one!"
I Samuel 2:11,"And Elkana went to Rama, to his house,
while the lad began to attend Y<small>HWH</small>, in the presence of Eli the priest."
I Samuel 2:12,"Now the sons of Eli were base fellows;
they did not know Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 2:13,"And the norm of the priests with the people [was]:
whoever sacrificed a sacrifice,
the priest’s serving-lad would come while the flesh was boiling
with a fork of three teeth in his hand"
I Samuel 2:14,"and would strike at the pot or the kettle or the cauldron or the boiling-vat;
everything the fork would bring up, the priest would take for himself.
Thus they would do to all Israel who were coming there, at Shilo."
I Samuel 2:15,"Even before they would turn the fat into smoke,
the serving-lad of the priest would come and say to the person sacrificing:
Give over some flesh for roasting, for the priest,
for he will not take boiled flesh from you—only raw!"
I Samuel 2:16,"And if the person said to him:
Let them first turn the fat into smoke, yes, smoke,
then take for yourself whatever your appetite craves—
he would say to him:
No, but give it over right-now;
if not, I’ll take it by force!"
I Samuel 2:17,"Now the sin of the serving-lads was exceedingly great in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
for the men scorned the gift [intended] for Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 2:18,"Shemuel was attending in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
as a lad girded with a linen <i>efod.</i>"
I Samuel 2:19,"Now a small cloak his mother used to make him
and used to bring it up from year to year, when she went up with her husband to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice."
I Samuel 2:20,"And Eli would bless Elkana and his wife;
he would say:
May Y<small>HWH</small> give you seed from this woman
in place of the requested-one who was lent-on-request to Y<small>HWH</small>!
Then they would go back to their place."
I Samuel 2:21,"Indeed, Y<small>HWH</small> took account of Hanna,
and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters;
but the lad Shemuel grew up in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 2:22,"Now when Eli became exceedingly old,
he heard about all that his sons were doing to all Israel:
how they were lying with the women who were acting-as-a- workforce at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment."
I Samuel 2:23,"He said to them:
Why do you act in accordance with these words that I hear—
evil accounts of you from all of these people?"
I Samuel 2:24,"Don’t, my sons!
Indeed, it is no good, the report that I hear Y<small>HWH</small>’s people spreading."
I Samuel 2:25,"If a man sins against [another] man, God will mediate for him,
but if it is against Y<small>HWH</small> [that] a man sins, who will intercede for him?
Yet they did not hearken to their father’s voice,
for Y<small>HWH</small> desired to have them die."
I Samuel 2:26,"But the lad Shemuel went on growing greater and more pleasing,
so with Y<small>HWH</small>, so with men."
I Samuel 2:27,"A man of God came to Eli and said to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
Did I not reveal, yes, reveal myself to your Father’s House when they were in Egypt, [belonging] to Pharaoh’s house,"
I Samuel 2:28,"and choose it from all the tribes of Israel for myself, to act-as- priests—
to ascend upon my sacrificial-altar, to send up smoking-incense, to wear the <i>efod</i> in my presence?
And I gave to your Father’s House all the fire-offerings of the Children of Israel."
I Samuel 2:29,"Why have you kicked away my sacrifices and my cereal-gifts that I commanded, with a grudging-eye?
And you have honored your sons more than me,
by letting them grow fat from the premier-part of all the gifts of Israel, in my presence!"
I Samuel 2:30,"Therefore,
the Utterance of Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel:
I had said, yes, said:
Your house and your Father’s House will walk in my presence for the ages;
but now, the Utterance of Y<small>HWH</small>:
[Heaven] forbid for me!
For those who honor me, I honor,
but those who despise me will be cursed!"
I Samuel 2:31,"Here, the days are coming
when I will hew off your arm and the arm of your Father’s House,
so that [no man] will grow old in your house;"
I Samuel 2:32,"you will look with a grudging-eye on all his doing-good for Israel,
and there will be no elder in your house, all the days [to come]."
I Samuel 2:33,"Yet I will not cut off everyone belonging to you from my sacrifices,
[but] to consume your eyes and exhaust your breath,
in all of the greater-part of your house, men will die."
I Samuel 2:34,"And this is the sign for you that it will come-to-pass for your two sons, for Hofni and Pin’has:
on a single day the two of them will die!"
I Samuel 2:35,"But I will establish for myself a trusted priest
who will do [what is] in my heart and in my being;
I will build him a trustworthy household,
and he will walk in the presence of my anointed one all the days [to come]."
I Samuel 2:36,"And it will be
that whoever is left in your house—
he will come to bow low to him
for payment of silver and a round-loaf of bread;
he will say:
Pray appoint me to one of the priestly-offices,
[for me] to eat a bit of bread!"
I Samuel 3:1,"The lad Shemuel was attending Y<small>HWH</small> in the presence of Eli.
Now the word of Y<small>HWH</small> was precious in those days;
visions were not widespread."
I Samuel 3:2,"It was on that day
that Eli was lying down in his place
—his eyes had begun to dim, [so that] he was not able to see—"
I Samuel 3:3,"and the lamp of God had not yet gone out,
while Shemuel was lying down in the great-hall of Y<small>HWH</small>, where the Coffer of God was."
I Samuel 3:4,"And Y<small>HWH</small> called to Shemuel.
He said:
Here I am."
I Samuel 3:5,"And he ran to Eli
and said:
Here I am, for you called me!
But he said:
I did not call;
return, lie down.
He went and lay down."
I Samuel 3:6,"But Y<small>HWH</small> called yet again: Shemuel!,
and Shemuel arose and went to Eli,
and said:
Here I am, for you called me!
But he said:
I did not call, my son!
Return, lie down."
I Samuel 3:7,"Now Shemuel did not yet know Y<small>HWH</small>;
not yet had the word of Y<small>HWH</small> been revealed to him."
I Samuel 3:8,"And Y<small>HWH</small> called again: Shemuel! a third time,
and he arose and went to Eli,
and said:
Here I am, for you called me!
Then Eli understood
that Y<small>HWH</small> was calling the lad."
I Samuel 3:9,"Eli said to Shemuel:
Go, lie down,
and it shall be, if he calls you, you are to say:
Speak, O Y<small>HWH</small>, for your servant hearkens!
So Shemuel went and lay down in his place."
I Samuel 3:10,"And Y<small>HWH</small> came and stood [there]
and called as time and time [before]: Shemuel! Shemuel!
Shemuel said: Speak, for your servant hearkens!"
I Samuel 3:11,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
Here, I am about to do a thing in Israel
such that everyone who hears of it—their two ears will ring!"
I Samuel 3:12,"On that day, I will fulfill upon Eli all that I spoke concerning his house,
from beginning to end!"
I Samuel 3:13,"I have told him
that I am passing judgment on his house, for the ages,
for the iniquity about which he has known,
because his sons were treating God lightly, yet he did not condemn them."
I Samuel 3:14,"Therefore I swear concerning the house of Eli:
Should the iniquity of the house of Eli be purged away
through sacrifices or grain-gifts, for the ages … !"
I Samuel 3:15,"Shemuel lay down until daybreak,
and he opened the doors of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
but Shemuel was afraid of reporting the seen-vision to Eli."
I Samuel 3:16,"Eli called Shemuel;
he said:
Shemuel, my son!
He said:
Here I am."
I Samuel 3:17,"He said:
What is the word that he spoke to you?
Now do not conceal it from me …
Thus may God do to you and thus may he add,
if you conceal from me any word
from all the word[s] that he spoke to you!"
I Samuel 3:18,"So Shemuel reported to him all the words, and he did not conceal [anything] from him.
And he said:
He is Y<small>HWH</small>;
whatever is good in his eyes, may he do!"
I Samuel 3:19,"Shemuel grew up, and Y<small>HWH</small> was with him;
he did not let any of his words fall to the ground."
I Samuel 3:20,"So all Israel knew, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,
that Shemuel was trustworthy as a prophet to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 3:21,"And Y<small>HWH</small> was seen again at Shilo,
for Y<small>HWH</small> had revealed himself to Shemuel at Shilo, in accord with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 4:1,"And the word of Shemuel came-to-pass for all Israel.…
And all Israel went out to meet the Philistines for battle;
they encamped at Even Ha-Ezer/The Stone of Help,
while the Philistines encamped at Afek."
I Samuel 4:2,"The Philistines arrayed-ranks to meet Israel,
and the battle was spread out, so that Israel was defeated before the Philistines—
they struck them in ranks in the open-field: about four thousand men."
I Samuel 4:3,"The people came back to the camp, and the elders of Israel said:
Why has Y<small>HWH</small> defeated us today before the Philistines?
Let us take ourselves, from Shilo, the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant,
that he may come into our midst
and deliver us from the grasp of our enemies!"
I Samuel 4:4,"So the people sent to Shilo,
and carried from there the Coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, [The One] Seated on the Winged-Sphinxes
—Eli’s two sons were there with the Coffer of the Covenant of God, Hofni and Pin’has."
I Samuel 4:5,"And it was
when the Coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> came into the camp
that all Israel shouted with a great shout,
so that the land was in panic."
I Samuel 4:6,"The Philistines heard the sound of the shouting
and said:
What is this great sound of shouting in the Hebrews’ camp?
Then they knew
that the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> had come into the camp."
I Samuel 4:7,"And the Philistines were afraid,
for they said [to themselves]:
A god has come into the camp!
And they said:
Woe to us,
for it was not like this yesterday [and] the day-before,"
I Samuel 4:8,"woe to us—
who will rescue us from the hand of this mighty god?
This is the god who struck down Egypt with every kind of blow in the wilderness!"
I Samuel 4:9,"Strengthen yourselves and be men, O Philistines,
lest you have to serve the Hebrews, as they have served you!
Be men and wage battle!"
I Samuel 4:10,"So the Philistines waged battle,
and Israel was defeated, so that they fled, each to his tent.
The striking-down was exceedingly great:
there fell from Israel thirty thousand foot-soldiers."
I Samuel 4:11,"Moreover the Coffer of God was taken,
and Eli’s two sons died, Hofni and Pin’has."
I Samuel 4:12,"A Binyaminite man ran from the ranks;
he came to Shilo on that same day
with his garb torn and earth on his head."
I Samuel 4:13,"He came, and here: Eli was sitting on a throne, beside the road, waiting-anxiously,
for his heart was trembling for the Coffer of God.
And when the man came to tell it in the town,
the whole town cried out;"
I Samuel 4:14,"Eli heard the sound of the outcry
and said:
What is this sound of panic?
The man quickly came and told it to Eli,"
I Samuel 4:15,"—Now Eli was ninety-eight years old;
his eyes were set so that he could not see—"
I Samuel 4:16,"the man said to Eli:
I am the one who comes from the ranks,
I myself—from the ranks I fled today!
He said:
How did the matter go, my son?"
I Samuel 4:17,"The newsbringer answered;
he said:
Israel has fled before the Philistines,
and also there has been a great defeat of the people,
and also your two sons died, Hofni and Pin’has,
and the Coffer of God has been taken!"
I Samuel 4:18,"Now it was,
at his making mention of the Coffer of God,
that he fell from on the throne backward, alongside the gate,
and his neck was broken, so that he died,
for he was an old man, and heavy.
He had led Israel as judge for forty years."
I Samuel 4:19,"Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Pin’has, was pregnant, about to give birth,
and when she heard the heard-report of the taking of the Coffer of God
and of the death of her father-in-law and her husband,
she crouched and gave birth,
for her labor-pains had turned [suddenly] upon her."
I Samuel 4:20,"At the time of her dying, those [women] standing over her spoke:
Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son!"
I Samuel 4:21,"But she did not answer, nor did she pay any mind,
but she called the lad I-Khavod/Where-is-Glory, saying:
Exiled is the glory from Israel!"
I Samuel 4:22,"She said:
Exiled is the glory from Israel,
for taken is the Coffer of God!"
I Samuel 5:1,"Now when the Philistines took the Coffer of God,
they brought it from Even Ha-Ezer to Ashdod."
I Samuel 5:2,"Then the Philistines took the Coffer of God
and brought it to the House of Dagon,
and set it next to Dagon."
I Samuel 5:3,"The Ashdodites started-early on the morrow,
but here was Dagon, fallen down on his face to the ground before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>!
So they took Dagon and returned him to his place."
I Samuel 5:4,"They started-early at daybreak, on the morrow,
but here was Dagon, fallen down on his face to the ground before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>,
with Dagon’s head and the two palms of his hands cut off, on the threshold;
only Dagon[’s torso] remained on him."
I Samuel 5:5,"—Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who enter the House of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod,
until this day."
I Samuel 5:6,"And the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was heavy against the Ashdodites, and he devastated them;
he struck them with tumors,
Ashdod and its territories."
I Samuel 5:7,"The men of Ashdod saw that [it was] thus,
so they said:
The Coffer of the God of Israel must not stay with us,
for his hand is hard upon us and upon Dagon our god!"
I Samuel 5:8,"So they sent and gathered together all the Philistine overlords to them
and said:
What shall we do with the Coffer of the God of Israel?
They said:
To Gat let the Coffer of the God of Israel be removed!
So they had the Coffer of the God of Israel removed [there]."
I Samuel 5:9,"But it was, after their removing it,
that the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was against the town, [causing] an exceedingly great panic;
he struck the men of the town, from small to great,
and tumors broke out on them."
I Samuel 5:10,"So they sent off the Coffer of God to Ekron,
but when the Coffer of God entered Ekron,
the Ekronites cried out, saying:
They have removed to us the Coffer of the God of Israel,
to cause our death and our people’s!"
I Samuel 5:11,"So they sent and gathered all the Philistine overlords
and said:
Send away the Coffer of the God of Israel, that it may return to its place,
so that it does not cause our death and our people’s!
For there was a death panic all throughout the town;
exceedingly heavy was the hand of God there."
I Samuel 5:12,"Now the men who did not die were struck with tumors,
and the town’s cry-for-help went up to the heavens."
I Samuel 6:1,Now the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> was in the territory of the Philistines for seven months;
I Samuel 6:2,"then the Philistines called for the priests and for the diviners, saying:
What are we to do with the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>?
Let us know how we can send it back to its place!"
I Samuel 6:3,"They said:
If you wish to send back the Coffer of the God of Israel, do not send it back empty,
rather, make restitution, yes, restitution to him with a reparation- offering;
then you will be healed
and it will be made known to you why his hand has not turned aside from you."
I Samuel 6:4,"They said:
What is the reparation-offering with which we are to make restitution to him?
They said:
[By] the number of Philistine overlords:
five gold tumors and five gold mice,
for one plague was upon all [of you] and upon your overlords."
I Samuel 6:5,"You are to make images of your tumors and images of your mice that are bringing the land to ruin,
and you are to give honor to the God of Israel;
perhaps he will lighten his hand from upon you,
from upon your gods and from upon your land."
I Samuel 6:6,"Why do you make your heart heavy-with-stubbornness,
as Egypt and Pharaoh made their heart heavy-with-stubbornness?
Was it not when he dealt wantonly with them that he sent them free and they went away?"
I Samuel 6:7,"So-now,
fetch and make ready a new wagon and two milch cows that have not yet yielded to a yoke;
you are to bind the cows to the wagon,
but you are to turn back their young behind them, indoors."
I Samuel 6:8,"Then you are to take the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>
and are to put it on the wagon,
and the gold objects with which you are making restitution to him as a reparation-offering
you are to place in a pouch, to its side;
then you are to send it off, that it may go."
I Samuel 6:9,"And look [well]:
if it goes up by way of its own territory, to Bet-Shemesh,
then he did us this great evil;
but if not,
we will know that his hand did not touch us—
an accident happened to us."
I Samuel 6:10,"The men did thus:
they got two milk-yielding cows and bound them to the wagon,
but their young they shut up indoors."
I Samuel 6:11,"And they placed the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> on the wagon,
along with the chest and the gold mice and the images of their tumors."
I Samuel 6:12,"And the cows went-straight on the road, on the road to Bet- Shemesh:
on one path they went, going along [and] lowing,
but they did not turn right or left,
while the Philistine overlords were walking behind them, as far as the territory of Bet-Shemesh."
I Samuel 6:13,"Now Bet-Shemesh were harvesting the wheat harvest in the valley,
and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the Coffer,
and they rejoiced seeing it."
I Samuel 6:14,"When the wagon came to the field of Yehoshua the Bet-Shimshite, and came to a stop there
—there was a great stone there—
they split the wood of the wagon,
while the cows they offered up as an offering-up to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 6:15,"Now the Levites had brought down the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>
and the pouch that was with it, in which the gold objects were,
and had put them on the great stone,
while the men of Bet-Shemesh had offered-up offerings-up
and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 6:16,"When the five Philistine overlords saw [it],
they returned to Ekron on that day."
I Samuel 6:17,"And these are the gold tumors with which the Philistines made restitution as a reparation-offering to Y<small>HWH</small>:
for Ashdod, one;
for Gaza, one;
for Ashkelon, one;
for Gat, one;
and for Ekron, one."
I Samuel 6:18,"And the gold mice
[were by] the number of all the towns of the Philistines, by the five overlords,
from fortified town as far as rural village,
as far as the great stone on which they deposited the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>;
until this day
[it is] in the Field of Yehoshua the Bet-Shimshite."
I Samuel 6:19,"But he struck down some of the men of Bet-Shemesh,
for they had looked at the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>;
he struck down of the people seventy men [and] fifty thousand men.
So the people mourned,
for Y<small>HWH</small> had struck down the people, a great striking-down."
I Samuel 6:20,"The men of Bet-Shemesh said:
Who can stand in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, this holy God?
And to whom may it be brought up away from us?"
I Samuel 6:21,"So they sent messengers to the settled-folk of Kiryat-Ye’arim, saying:
The Philistines have returned the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>;
go down, bring it up to you!"
I Samuel 7:1,"So the men of Kiryat-Ye’arim came and brought up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>;
they brought it to the house of Avinadav in Giv’a,
and El’azar his son they hallowed to watch over the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 7:2,"Now it was,
from the time of the Coffer staying in Kiryat-Ye’arim,
—the years became many, so that they became twenty years—
that the whole House of Israel sighed after Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 7:3,"So Shemuel said to the whole House of Israel, saying:
If it is with all your heart that you are returning to Y<small>HWH</small>,
put away the foreign gods from your midst, including the Astartes;
direct your hearts toward Y<small>HWH</small>, and serve him alone,
and he will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines!"
I Samuel 7:4,"And the Children of Israel put away the Baals and the Astartes,
and served Y<small>HWH</small> alone."
I Samuel 7:5,"And Shemuel said:
Gather all Israel to Mitzpa/Lookout, so that I may intercede on your behalf to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 7:6,"They were gathered to Mitzpa;
then they drew water and poured it out in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and fasted on that day.
They declared there:
We have sinned against Y<small>HWH</small>!
And Shemuel acted-as-judge for the Children of Israel at Mitzpa."
I Samuel 7:7,"The Philistines heard that the Children of Israel were gathered at Mitzpa,
so the Philistine overlords went up against Israel;
and the Children of Israel heard, and they became afraid before the Philistines."
I Samuel 7:8,"The Children of Israel said to Shemuel:
Do not be silent from us, from crying out to Y<small>HWH</small> our God,
that he may deliver us from the hand of the Philistines!"
I Samuel 7:9,"So Shemuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as an offering-up, a whole-offering, to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and Shemuel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small> on behalf of Israel,
and Y<small>HWH</small> answered him."
I Samuel 7:10,"Now it was, when Shemuel was offering up the offering-up,
that the Philistines approached for battle against Israel.
And Y<small>HWH</small> thundered with a great sound on that day against the Philistines;
he panicked them, so that they were defeated before Israel."
I Samuel 7:11,"The men of Israel went out from Mitzpa
and pursued the Philistines,
and they struck them as far as below Bet-Kar."
I Samuel 7:12,"Then Shemuel took a stone and put it between Mitzpa and Shen/ The Tooth-Rock
and called its name Even Ha-Ezer/The Stone of Help;
he said:
Near here, Y<small>HWH</small> helped us!"
I Samuel 7:13,"So the Philistines were humbled;
they no longer came anymore into the territory of Israel,
and the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was against the Philistines all the days of Shemuel."
I Samuel 7:14,"The towns that the Philistines had taken away from Israel returned to Israel,
from Ekron as far as Gat,
while their territory Israel rescued from the hand of the Philistines.
Now there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
I Samuel 7:15,Shemuel led Israel as judge all the days of his life:
I Samuel 7:16,"he would go year after year,
circling about Bet-El, Gilgal, and Mitzpa,
and would act-as-judge over Israel near all these sacred-places;"
I Samuel 7:17,"then his return [would be] to Rama, for there was his house,
and there he would act-as-judge over Israel.
He built there an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 8:1,"Now it was, when Shemuel had grown old,
that he made his sons judges for Israel"
I Samuel 8:2,"—the name of his firstborn son was Yoel,
and the name of his second, Aviyya—
judges in Be’er-Sheva."
I Samuel 8:3,"But his sons did not walk in his ways:
they turned aside after profit,
and they took bribes and cast aside cases-for-justice."
I Samuel 8:4,"So all the elders of Israel gathered together
and came to Shemuel at Rama;"
I Samuel 8:5,"they said to him:
Here, you have grown old,
and your sons have not walked in your ways.
So-now,
make us a king to lead us, like all the nations!"
I Samuel 8:6,"The matter was evil in the eyes of Shemuel, when they said:
Give us a king to lead us!
So Shemuel prayed to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Samuel 8:7,"and Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to you;
for it is not you they have rejected,
rather, it is me they have rejected from being king over them,"
I Samuel 8:8,"just like all the deeds that they have done
from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day:
they have abandoned me
and served other gods!
Thus they are doing to you as well!"
I Samuel 8:9,"So-now, hearken to their voice.
However, you are to warn, yes, warn them;
you are to tell them the rule of the king who will reign as
king over them."
I Samuel 8:10,"And Shemuel related all the words of Y<small>HWH</small>
to the people who were requesting a king from him;"
I Samuel 8:11,"he said:
This will be the rule of the king who will reign as king over you:
your sons he will take away,
setting them in his chariotry and among his riders,
so that they run ahead of his chariotry,"
I Samuel 8:12,"to make them commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties,
to plow his plowing and harvest his harvest,
and to make his battle weapons and his chariot weapons;"
I Samuel 8:13,"your daughters he will take away
as ointment-mixers, as cooks, and as bakers;"
I Samuel 8:14,"your fields, your vineyards, and your olive-groves, the best ones, he will take away
and give to his servants;"
I Samuel 8:15,"your sowing-seed and your vine-fruit he will tithe
and give to his officers and to his servants;"
I Samuel 8:16,"your servants, your maids, your best young-men, and your donkeys, he will take away,
that they may do his work;"
I Samuel 8:17,"your flock he will tithe,
and you yourselves will be slaves for him."
I Samuel 8:18,"And you will cry out on that day
because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves,
but Y<small>HWH</small> will not answer you on that day!"
I Samuel 8:19,"But the people refused to hearken to Shemuel’s voice; they said:
No!
Rather, let there be a king over us"
I Samuel 8:20,"so that we, we too may be like all the nations!
Let our king lead us
and go out before us
and fight battles for us!"
I Samuel 8:21,"Shemuel heard all the people’s words,
and spoke them in the hearing of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 8:22,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
Hearken to their voice:
you are to king them a king!
Then Shemuel said to the men of Israel:
Go back, each to his town."
I Samuel 9:1,"Now there was a man of Binyamin—
his name was Kish son of Aviel son of Tzeror son of Bekhorat son of Afiakh,
the son of a [Bin]yaminite man,
a mighty-man of value."
I Samuel 9:2,"He had a son—his name was Sha’ul/Requested-One:
a youth, and goodly;
now there was no man of the Children of Israel goodlier than he,
from his shoulders and upward, taller than all the people."
I Samuel 9:3,"And the she-asses of Kish, the father of Sha’ul, strayed,
so Kish said to Sha’ul his son:
Pray take with you one of the serving-lads
and arise, go, look for the she-asses!"
I Samuel 9:4,"They crossed the highlands of Efrayim and crossed the region of Shalisha, but they did not find them;
and they crossed the region of Shaalim, but—nothing;
and they crossed the region of [Bin]yamin, but they did not find them."
I Samuel 9:5,"They had [just] come to the region of Tzuf,
when Sha’ul said to his serving-lad who was with him:
Go, let’s turn back,
lest my father stop [caring] about the she-asses and worry about us!"
I Samuel 9:6,"But he said to him:
Here, there is a man of God in this town;
the man is honored—
all that he speaks comes, yes, comes-to-pass.
Now let us go there;
perhaps he can tell us about our way on which we have gone."
I Samuel 9:7,"Sha’ul said to his lad:
But here, if we go,
what can we bring for the man?
For the food is gone from our vessels,
and there is no present to bring to the man of God.
What is with us?"
I Samuel 9:8,"The lad answered Sha’ul further,
he said:
Here, I find in my hand a quarter weight of silver;
I will give it to the man of God, so that he may tell us about our way."
I Samuel 9:9,"—Formerly in Israel,
thus would a man say when he went to inquire of God:
Go, let us go to the seer.
For a prophet today was formerly called a seer.—"
I Samuel 9:10,"Sha’ul said to his lad:
Your words are good;
Go, let’s go!
So they went to the town where the man of God was."
I Samuel 9:11,"They were going up the ascent to the town
when they found some girls coming out to draw water;
they said to them:
Is the seer in this place?"
I Samuel 9:12,"They answered them and said:
He is—here, ahead of you;
go quickly now,
for just now he has come to town,
for there is a sacrificial-meal today for the people at the sanctuary."
I Samuel 9:13,"As soon as you come into the town, you will find him,
before he goes up to the sanctuary to eat
—for the people will not eat until his coming,
for he must bless the sacrifice;
after that, the invited-guests may eat.
So-now, go up;
as for him, this very day you will find him."
I Samuel 9:14,"So they went up to the town.
They were coming into the midst of the town,
and here, Shemuel was coming out toward them
to go up to the sanctuary."
I Samuel 9:15,"Now Y<small>HWH</small> had bared Shemuel’s ear
a day before Sha’ul’s coming, saying:"
I Samuel 9:16,"Around this time tomorrow
I will send to you a man from the region of Binyamin;
you are to anoint him as <i>Nagid</i> over my people Israel.
He will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines—
for I have seen my people,
for their cry has come to me!"
I Samuel 9:17,"Now when Shemuel saw Sha’ul,
Y<small>HWH</small> declared to him:
Here is the man about whom I said to you:
This one shall keep rein on my people!"
I Samuel 9:18,"Sha’ul approached Shemuel amid the gateway
and said:
Now tell me:
Where is the seer’s house?"
I Samuel 9:19,"Shemuel answered Sha’ul,
he said:
I am the seer.
Go up ahead of me to the sanctuary;
you are to eat with me today.
Then I will send you off at daybreak,
and all that is in your heart I will tell you."
I Samuel 9:20,"As for the she-asses that were straying from you three days ago,
do not take them to heart, for they have been found—
and to whom do all the riches of Israel belong,
is it not to you and to all your Father’s House?"
I Samuel 9:21,"Sha’ul answered and said:
Am I not a Binyaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel,
and my clan is the least of all the clans of the tribe of Binyamin?
So why do you speak to me according to these words?"
I Samuel 9:22,"Shemuel took Sha’ul and his serving-lad, brought them to the dining-hall
and gave them a place at the head of the invited-guests
—they were about thirty men."
I Samuel 9:23,"Shemuel said to the cook:
Give over the portion that I gave you,
about which I said to you: Set it [aside] with you."
I Samuel 9:24,"So the cook raised the thigh and the fat-tail and offered it up and set it before Sha’ul.
He said:
Here is what-is-reserved;
set it before you, eat,
since for this appointed-time it has been kept for you, saying:
I have invited the people.
So Sha’ul ate with Shemuel on that day."
I Samuel 9:25,"Then they went down from the sanctuary to the town,
and he spoke with Sha’ul on the roof."
I Samuel 9:26,"… they started-early;
so it was, when dawn came up,
that Shemuel called Sha’ul to the roof, saying:
Arise, so that I may send you off.
Sha’ul arose, and the two of them went forth, he and Shemuel, outside."
I Samuel 9:27,"They were going down, at the edge of the town,
when Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
Speak to the lad, that he may cross over ahead of us,
—and he crossed over—
but you stop at once,
that I may have you hear the word of God."
I Samuel 10:1,"And Shemuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him,
and he said:
Is it not [so] that Y<small>HWH</small> has anointed you over his inheritance as <i>Nagid</i>?"
I Samuel 10:2,"When you go today from me,
you will find two men by Rahel’s burial-place in the territory of Binyamin, at Tzeltzah;
they will say to you:
They are found, the she-asses that you went to look for!
Here, your father has left off the matter of the she-asses,
but he is worried about you, saying:
What should I do about my son?"
I Samuel 10:3,"So you are to move on from there, and further,
and you are to come to the Oak of Tavor;
they will find you, three men going up to [worship] God at Bet-El—
one carrying three kids,
one carrying three rounds of bread,
and one carrying a skin of wine."
I Samuel 10:4,"They will ask you after [your] welfare,
and they will give you two bread-loaves;
you are to take them from their hand."
I Samuel 10:5,"After that, you will come to Giv’at Elohim/The Hill of God, where the Philistine garrison is;
and it will be, when you come there, to the town,
that you will encounter a band of prophets coming down from the sanctuary,
and ahead of them, lyre and timbrel, flute and harp,
and they will be ranting-in-prophecy."
I Samuel 10:6,"Now the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> will advance upon you,
so that you will rant-like-a-prophet with them,
and you will be changed into another man."
I Samuel 10:7,"And it will be,
when these signs come-to-pass for you,
do for yourself whatever your hand finds [to do]!
For God is with you."
I Samuel 10:8,"Then you are to go down ahead of me, to Gilgal,
and here, I will be going down to you to offer up offerings-up and to sacrifice sacrifices of <i>shalom.</i>
For seven days you are to tarry, until I come to you;
then I will make known to you what you are to do."
I Samuel 10:9,"Now it was,
when he faced about to go from Shemuel,
that God changed in him another heart,
and all these signs came-to-pass on that day."
I Samuel 10:10,"They came there, to Giv’a,
and here, a band of prophets, [coming] to meet him!
The rushing-spirit of God advanced upon him,
and he ranted-like-a-prophet in their midst."
I Samuel 10:11,"It was:
all who knew him from yesterday [and] the day-before,
when they saw
that here, with the prophets he was ranting-like-a-prophet,
the people said, each one to his neighbor:
What, now, has come over the son of Kish?
Is Sha’ul too among the prophets?"
I Samuel 10:12,"And a man from there spoke up and said:
But who is their father?
Therefore it became a proverb:
Is Sha’ul too among the prophets?"
I Samuel 10:13,"He finished ranting-like-a-prophet, and came to the sanctuary."
I Samuel 10:14,"Now Sha’ul’s uncle said to him and to his serving-lad:
Where did you go?
He said:
To look for the she-asses.
And when we saw that [they were] not [there],
we came to Shemuel."
I Samuel 10:15,"Sha’ul’s uncle said:
Pray tell me:
What did Shemuel say to you?"
I Samuel 10:16,"Sha’ul said to his uncle:
He told, yes, told us
that the she-asses had been found.
But as for the matter of the kingship,
he did not tell him what Shemuel had said."
I Samuel 10:17,"Now Shemuel summoned the people to Y<small>HWH</small>, at Mitzpa."
I Samuel 10:18,"He said to the Children of Israel:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
I myself brought Israel up from Egypt,
I rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you."
I Samuel 10:19,"But you, today: you have rejected your God,
the one delivering you from all your trials and your troubles!
You said to him:
No, rather, a king make over us!
So-now,
station yourselves in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, by your tribes, by your families."
I Samuel 10:20,"So Shemuel brought near each of the tribes of Israel,
and the tribe of Binyamin was captured-by-lot."
I Samuel 10:21,"Then he brought near the tribe of Binyamin by its clans,
and the Matrite clan was captured-by-lot;
then Sha’ul son of Kish was captured-by-lot.
But when they looked for him, he was not to be found."
I Samuel 10:22,"So they inquired further of Y<small>HWH</small>:
Has any other man come here?
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Here, he has hidden himself among the gear!"
I Samuel 10:23,"They ran and fetched him from there
and he stood amid the people,
and he was taller than all the people, from his shoulders and upward."
I Samuel 10:24,"Then Shemuel said to all the people:
Do you see whom Y<small>HWH</small> has chosen?
Indeed, there is none like him among all the people!
And all the people shouted;
they proclaimed: May the king live!"
I Samuel 10:25,"And Shemuel spoke to the people, the rule of kingship,
and wrote it in a record,
and put it in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>.
Then Shemuel sent all the people off, each one to his house."
I Samuel 10:26,"And Sha’ul too went to his house at Giv’a,
and there went with him the valiant ones
whose heart God had touched."
I Samuel 10:27,"Now some base fellows said:
How can this one deliver us?
So they despised him
and did not bring him a gift.
But he was like one silent."
I Samuel 11:1,"Now Nahash / Snake the Ammonite went up
and encamped against Yavesh-Gil’ad.
All the men of Yavesh said to Nahash:
Cut a covenant with us, and we will serve you!"
I Samuel 11:2,"But Nahash the Ammonite said to them:
On <i>this</i> [condition] I will cut [a covenant] with you—
on [condition of] gouging out every one of your right eyes!
Thus will I make it a disgrace upon all Israel!"
I Samuel 11:3,"The elders of Yavesh said to him:
Leave us be for seven days;
we wish to send messengers throughout all the territory of Israel.
And if there is no deliverer for us,
we will go out [to surrender] to you."
I Samuel 11:4,"The messengers came to the Hill of Sha’ul
and spoke the words in the hearing of the people,
and all the people lifted up their voice and wept."
I Samuel 11:5,"Now here, when Sha’ul came after the cattle, from the open-field,
Sha’ul said:
What [ails] the people, that they are weeping?
They related to him the words of the men of Yavesh."
I Samuel 11:6,"And the rushing-spirit of God advanced upon Sha’ul when he heard these words,
and his anger flared up exceedingly;"
I Samuel 11:7,"he took a brace of cattle and chopped it up,
and he sent it off throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying:
Whoever does not go out [to war] after Sha’ul and after Shemuel,
thus shall be done to his cattle!
And a terror of Y<small>HWH</small> fell upon the people,
so that they went out as one man."
I Samuel 11:8,"He counted them [for war] at Bezek:
the Children of Israel totaled three hundred thousand,
while the men of Judah were thirty thousand."
I Samuel 11:9,"Then he said to the messengers who came:
Thus you are to say to the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad:
Tomorrow there will be victory for you, when the sun is hot!
The messengers came
and told it to the men of Yavesh,
and they rejoiced."
I Samuel 11:10,"And the men of Yavesh said:
Tomorrow we will go out to you,
and you may do with us whatever is good in your eyes."
I Samuel 11:11,"Now it was on the morrow
that Sha’ul put the fighting-people into three companies;
they entered the midst of the camp at the daybreak watch
and struck Ammon until the hot-part of the day.
And it was that those [who were] left—they were scattered,
so that there were not left among them two together."
I Samuel 11:12,"The people said to Shemuel:
Who was it that said: Shall Sha’ul be king over us?
Give over the men, that we may put them to death!"
I Samuel 11:13,"But Sha’ul said:
No one is to be put to death on this day,
for today Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought victory in Israel!"
I Samuel 11:14,"Shemuel said to the people:
Come, let us go to Gilgal,
and let us renew the kingship there!"
I Samuel 11:15,"So all the people went to Gilgal
and made Sha’ul king there, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> at Gilgal.
They sacrificed sacrifices of <i>shalom</i> there, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and there Sha’ul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly."
I Samuel 12:1,"Shemuel said to all Israel:
Here, I have hearkened to your voice, in all that you have said to me:
I have set-a-king as king over you."
I Samuel 12:2,"So-now,
here is the king, going about before you,
but I, I have grown old, and I have grown hoary,
and as for my sons—here they are with you;
but I, I have gone about before you from my youth until this day."
I Samuel 12:3,"Here I am:
testify against me, before Y<small>HWH</small> and before his anointed one:
Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken?
Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I crushed?
And from whose hand have I taken a ransom, that I shut my eyes with it?
—I will return them to you!"
I Samuel 12:4,"They said:
You have not defrauded us, you have not oppressed us,
you have not taken a thing from anyone’s hand!"
I Samuel 12:5,"He said to them:
Y<small>HWH</small> is witness before you and his anointed one is a witness this day
that you have not found a thing in my hand!
They said:
Witness!"
I Samuel 12:6,"Shemuel said to the people:
[It is] Y<small>HWH</small>
who wrought-deeds with Moshe and with Aharon,
and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt."
I Samuel 12:7,"So-now,
stand fast, that I may plead-in-judgment with you in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
concerning all of Y<small>HWH</small>’s righteous-acts that he has wrought with you and with your fathers."
I Samuel 12:8,"When Yaakov came to Egypt,
and your fathers cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>,
Y<small>HWH</small> sent Moshe and Aharon;
they brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place."
I Samuel 12:9,"But they forgot Y<small>HWH</small> their God,
so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the armed- forces of Hatzor,
into the hand of the Philistines,
and into the hand of the king of Moav,
so that they waged battle against them."
I Samuel 12:10,"Then they cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>,
they said: We have sinned!
For we have abandoned Y<small>HWH</small> and served the Baals and the Astartes!
So-now, rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you!"
I Samuel 12:11,"So Y<small>HWH</small> sent Yerub-baal, and Bedan, and Yiftah, and Shemuel,
and rescued you from the hand of your enemies round about,
so that you dwelt in security."
I Samuel 12:12,"But when you saw that Nahash king of the Children of Ammon was coming against you,
you said to me:
No, rather, a king must reign-as-king over us
—but Y<small>HWH</small> your God is your king!"
I Samuel 12:13,"So-now,
here is the king whom you have chosen, whom you have requested;
here, Y<small>HWH</small> has placed a king over you."
I Samuel 12:14,"If you hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe,
and serve him and hearken to his voice,
and do not revolt against Y<small>HWH</small>’s order,
and both you and the king who reigns as king over you [follow] after Y<small>HWH</small> your God … !"
I Samuel 12:15,"But if you do not hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and revolt against Y<small>HWH</small>’s order,
then Y<small>HWH</small>’s hand will be against you [as it was] against your fathers."
I Samuel 12:16,"Even now, stand fast and see this great thing
that Y<small>HWH</small> is about to do before your eyes:"
I Samuel 12:17,"Is it not the wheat cutting today?
I will call out to Y<small>HWH</small>,
so that he gives forth thunder-sounds and rain—
then know and take note
that your evil is great that you have done in Y<small>HWH</small>’s eyes
by requesting yourselves a king!"
I Samuel 12:18,"So Shemuel called out to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and Y<small>HWH</small> gave forth thunder-sounds and rain on that day.
And all the people [stood] in exceedingly great fear of Y<small>HWH</small> and of Shemuel."
I Samuel 12:19,"Then all the people said to Shemuel:
Intercede on behalf of your servants to Y<small>HWH</small> your God, so that we do not die,"
I Samuel 12:20,"Shemuel said to the people:
Do not be afraid.
You have done all this evil,
but do not turn aside from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>;
you are to serve Y<small>HWH</small> God with all your heart!"
I Samuel 12:21,"You are not to turn aside
after the confusion-gods who will not avail, who will not prevail,
for they are confusion!"
I Samuel 12:22,"For Y<small>HWH</small> will not forsake his people
because of his great name;
for Y<small>HWH</small> has ventured to make you into a people for him."
I Samuel 12:23,"I too—
[Heaven] forbid for me, sinning against Y<small>HWH</small>,
by holding back from interceding on your behalf!
I will instruct you in the good and right way."
I Samuel 12:24,"Only: hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe:
you are to serve him in truth with all your heart,
for see how he does-great-things with you!"
I Samuel 12:25,"But if you do evil, yes, evil,
both you and your king will be swept away!"
I Samuel 13:1,"Sha’ul [was] ____ years old upon his becoming king,
and for ____ years he reigned as king over Israel."
I Samuel 13:2,"And Sha’ul chose for himself three thousand [men] from Israel;
there were two thousand with Sha’ul at Mikhmas and at the highlands of Bet-El
and a thousand were with Yonatan at the Hill of Binyamin,
while the rest of the people he sent away, each one to his tent."
I Samuel 13:3,"And Yonatan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geva,
and the Philistines heard [about it].
And Sha’ul sounded the <i>shofar</i> throughout all the land, saying:
Let the Hebrews hearken!"
I Samuel 13:4,"All Israel did hearken, saying:
Sha’ul has struck the garrison of the Philistines,
and also Israel reeks to the Philistines!
And the people were summoned after Sha’ul, to Gilgal."
I Samuel 13:5,"Now the Philistines had gathered to do battle with Israel,
three thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen,
and fighting-people like the sand that is on the shore of the sea in abundance;
they came up and encamped at Mikhmas, east of Bet-Aven."
I Samuel 13:6,"Now the men of Israel saw that they were in [dire] straits,
for the fighting-people were pressed
—the people hid themselves
in caves, in holes, in boulder-cracks,
in tunnels, and in cisterns,"
I Samuel 13:7,"while [some] Hebrews crossed the Jordan, into the region of Gad and Gil’ad.
Now Sha’ul was still in Gilgal, with all the fighting-people trembling behind him."
I Samuel 13:8,"And he waited for seven days,
for the appointed-time that Shemuel had [set],
but Shemuel did not come to Gilgal,
and the people began to scatter from him."
I Samuel 13:9,"So Sha’ul said:
Bring close to me the offering-up and the <i>shalom</i>-offerings!
And he offered up the offering-up."
I Samuel 13:10,"But then it was,
when he had finished offering up the offering-up,
that here: Shemuel came.
Sha’ul went out to meet him, to bless him [in greeting]."
I Samuel 13:11,"But Shemuel said:
What have you done?
Sha’ul said:
When I saw that the fighting-people were scattering from me,
—and you, you did not come within the appointed days—
and the Philistines were gathering at Mikhmas,"
I Samuel 13:12,"I said [to myself]:
Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal,
yet Y<small>HWH</small>’s face I have not soothed!
So I forced myself,
and offered up the offering-up."
I Samuel 13:13,"Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
You have acted-foolishly!
If you had kept the command of Y<small>HWH</small> your God which he commanded you,
indeed now, Y<small>HWH</small> would have established your kingship over Israel for the ages."
I Samuel 13:14,"But now, your kingship will not stand!
Y<small>HWH</small> seeks for himself a man after his own heart,
so that Y<small>HWH</small> may commission him as <i>Nagid</i> over his people,
for you have not kept what Y<small>HWH</small> commanded you!"
I Samuel 13:15,"Shemuel arose and went up from Gilgal toward the Hill of Binyamin,
while Sha’ul counted the fighting-people who were found with him [for war],
about six hundred men."
I Samuel 13:16,"Now Sha’ul and Yonatan his son and all the people who were found with them were situated on the Hill of Binyamin,
while the Philistines were encamped at Mikhmas."
I Samuel 13:17,"And the ruinbringers went out of the Philistines’ camp in three companies:
one company facing toward the road to Ofra, toward the Region of the Jackal,"
I Samuel 13:18,"one company facing the road to Bet-Horon,
and one company facing the road of the border which looks out over the Ravine of the Hyena, in the wilderness."
I Samuel 13:19,"—Now no metal worker could be found throughout all the land of Israel,
for the Philistines had said [to themselves]:
Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears!"
I Samuel 13:20,"So all Israel had to go down to the Philistines,
for each one to have his plowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his sickle forged."
I Samuel 13:21,"And the sharpening-charge was a <i>pim</i> for plowshares and for mattocks,
for three-pronged [forks] and for axes,
and for setting the goads."
I Samuel 13:22,"So it was on the day of the battle
that there was not to be found sword or spear in the hand of all the fighting-people who were with Sha’ul and Yonatan,
but they were found for Sha’ul and for Yonatan his son."
I Samuel 13:23,And the Philistine garrison went out to the Pass of Mikhmas.
I Samuel 14:1,"Now one day it was
that Yonatan son of Sha’ul said to the serving-lad, his weapons bearer:
Come, let’s cross over to the Philistines’ garrison,
the one that is across, over there!
But his father he did not tell."
I Samuel 14:2,"Now Sha’ul was staying at the edge of Geva,
beneath the Pomegranate [Rock] that is in the Migron;
and the fighting-people that were with him were about six hundred men,"
I Samuel 14:3,"while Ahiyya son of Ahituv, brother of I-Khavod, son of Pin’has son of Eli, priest of Y<small>HWH</small> at Shilo, was wearing the <i>efod.</i>
But the people did not know that Yonatan had gone."
I Samuel 14:4,"Now between the gorge-crossings that Yonatan sought to cross, to [get to] the Philistines’ garrison,
was a tooth-shaped cliff over here and a tooth-shaped cliff over there:
the name of the one was Botzetz, and the name of the other was Senne."
I Samuel 14:5,"The one tooth was located on the north, in front of Mikhmas,
while the other was on the south, in front of Geva."
I Samuel 14:6,"Yehonatan said to the lad, his weapons bearer:
Come, let’s cross over to the garrison of these Foreskinned Ones!
Perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will act on our behalf,
for there is nothing to constrain Y<small>HWH</small> from delivering by the many or by the few!"
I Samuel 14:7,"His weapons bearer said to him:
Do whatever your heart inclines to—
here, I am with you, according to your heart!"
I Samuel 14:8,"Yehonatan said:
Here, we are crossing over to the men,
and we will be revealing ourselves to them;"
I Samuel 14:9,"if they say thus to us:
Halt, until we get close to you—
we will stop in our place, and will not go up against them."
I Samuel 14:10,"But if they say thus:
Come up to us—
then we will go up,
for Y<small>HWH</small> will have given them into our hand,
and this will be the sign for us."
I Samuel 14:11,"So the two of them revealed themselves to the Philistines’ garrison,
and the Philistines said:
Here, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they were hiding themselves!"
I Samuel 14:12,"And the men of the garrison yelled out to Yonatan and to his weapons bearer,
and said:
Come up to us,
and we will show you something!
Yonatan said to his weapons bearer:
Come up behind me,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has given them into the hand of Israel!"
I Samuel 14:13,"So Yonatan climbed up by his hands and by his feet, with his weapons bearer behind him.
And they fell before Yonatan, while his weapons bearer dispatched them behind him."
I Samuel 14:14,"Now the first striking-down that Yonatan and his weapons bearer struck was some twenty men,
over about half a furrow for a brace [of oxen plowing] in a field."
I Samuel 14:15,"And there was trembling in the camp, out in the open-field, and among all the fighting-people
—the garrison and the ruinbringers fell-to-trembling, they too, and the earth shuddered;
it was a trembling of God."
I Samuel 14:16,"Now Sha’ul’s watchmen saw at the Hill of Binyamin,
and here, the throng was swaying, going and coming back there."
I Samuel 14:17,"And Sha’ul said to the people who were with him:
Pray count and see who has gone out from us!
They counted, and here: Yonatan and his weapons bearer were not [there],"
I Samuel 14:18,"Sha’ul said to Ahiyya:
Bring close the Coffer of God
—for the Coffer of God was at that time with the Children of Israel."
I Samuel 14:19,"And it was,
as Sha’ul was speaking to the priest,
that the panic that was in the Philistines’ camp went on and on [becoming] greater;
Sha’ul said to the priest:
Withdraw your hand!"
I Samuel 14:20,"And Sha’ul cried out, and all the people that were with him;
they came out to the battle,
and here: each one’s sword was against his neighbor,
an exceedingly great panic."
I Samuel 14:21,"Now the Hebrews [that] had been with the Philistines yesterday [and] the day-before,
in that they had gone up with them to the camp all around,
they too [turned] to be with Israel, who were with Sha’ul and Yonatan,"
I Samuel 14:22,"while all the [other] men of Israel, the ones hiding themselves in the highlands of Efrayim,
heard that the Philistines had fled,
and they too caught up with them in battle."
I Samuel 14:23,"So Y<small>HWH</small> delivered Israel on that day,
and the battle crossed by Bet-Aven."
I Samuel 14:24,"But the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day,
for Sha’ul had put an oath-curse on the fighting-people, saying:
Doomed be the man that eats food until sunset,
that I may be avenged on my enemies!
So all the people did not taste food."
I Samuel 14:25,"Now when all the people came into the forest,
there was honey on the surface of the open-field."
I Samuel 14:26,"And when the people came into the forest,
here: honey was running free,
but no one reached his hand to his mouth,
for the people were afraid of the sworn-oath."
I Samuel 14:27,"Now Yonatan had not heard when his father had made the people swear,
so he stretched out the edge of the staff that was in his hand
and dipped it into the honeycomb;
then he returned his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened."
I Samuel 14:28,"A man from [among] the fighting-people spoke up and said:
Your father had the people swear, yes, swear, saying:
Doomed be the man who eats food today!
And the people grew weary."
I Samuel 14:29,"Yonatan said:
My father has stirred-up-disaster for the land!
Pray see: indeed, my eyes are brightened,
for I tasted this little [bit of] honey;"
I Samuel 14:30,"if the people had eaten, yes, eaten today from their enemies’ spoils that they found,
indeed now, wouldn’t the strike against the Philistines have been greater?"
I Samuel 14:31,"They struck down the Philistines on that day from Mikhmas to Ayalon,
and the people grew exceedingly weary."
I Samuel 14:32,"So the people swooped down on the spoil
and took sheep and cattle and young-cattle, slaughtering them to the ground,
and the people ate [them] with the blood."
I Samuel 14:33,"Someone told Sha’ul, saying:
Here, the people are sinning against Y<small>HWH</small>, in eating with the blood!
He said:
You have [all] broken faith!
Roll me a great stone here."
I Samuel 14:34,"And Sha’ul said:
Scatter among the fighting-people;
you are to say to them:
Each one bring close to me his ox, each one his lamb;
you are to slaughter them here and are to eat,
and you are not to sin against Y<small>HWH</small> by eating with the blood!
So all the people brought close each one his ox in his hand that night, and they slaughtered them there."
I Samuel 14:35,"And Sha’ul built a sacrificial-altar to Y<small>HWH</small>;
it was the first [that he] built as an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 14:36,"Sha’ul said:
Let us go down after the Philistines at night, and plunder among them until the light of daybreak,
and let us not leave a man of them!
They said:
Whatever is good in your eyes, do!
But the priest said:
Let us draw near here to God."
I Samuel 14:37,"So Sha’ul inquired of God:
Shall I go down after the Philistines?
Will you give them into the hand of Israel?
But he did not answer him on that day."
I Samuel 14:38,"Then Sha’ul said:
Come close to here, all the “cornerstones” of the people;
know and take note
wherein this sin occurred today."
I Samuel 14:39,"For by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, who delivers Israel,
for even if it be Yonatan my son,
indeed, he will die, yes, die!
But no one answered him from all the people."
I Samuel 14:40,"He said to all Israel:
You be on one side,
and I and Yonatan my son will be on one side.
The people said to Sha’ul:
What is good in your eyes, do!"
I Samuel 14:41,"Sha’ul said to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Give <i>tammim!</i>
Yonatan and Sha’ul were captured-by-lot,
and the people escaped."
I Samuel 14:42,"Then Sha’ul said:
Cast [lots] between me and Yonatan my son!
And Yonatan was captured-by-lot."
I Samuel 14:43,"Sha’ul said to Yonatan:
Tell me what you have done!
So Yonatan told him;
he said:
I tasted, yes, tasted with the edge of the staff that was in my hand, a little honey.
Here I am; I will die."
I Samuel 14:44,"Sha’ul said:
Thus may God do, and thus may he add,
for you shall die, yes, die, Yonatan!"
I Samuel 14:45,"But the people said to Sha’ul:
Shall Yonatan die, who has wrought this great victory in Israel?
[Heaven] forbid, by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
if a [single] hair of his head should fall to the ground … !
For with God he has acted this day!
Thus the people redeemed Yonatan, so that he did not die."
I Samuel 14:46,"And Sha’ul went up from [pursuing] after the Philistines,
while the Philistines went back to their place."
I Samuel 14:47,"Now when Sha’ul had captured the kingship over Israel,
he waged battle all around against all his enemies:
against Moav, against the Children of Ammon, against Edom, against the king of Tzova, and against the Philistines;
and wherever he faced, he was victorious."
I Samuel 14:48,"He did valiantly: he struck down Amalek
and rescued Israel from the hand of its pillager."
I Samuel 14:49,"Now the sons of Sha’ul were:
Yonatan, Yishvi, and Malki-Shua.
And the name of his two daughters:
the name of the firstborn was Merav,
and the name of the younger-one was Mikhal."
I Samuel 14:50,"And the name of Sha’ul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaatz.
And the name of the commander of his armed-forces was Aviner, son of Ner, Sha’ul’s uncle."
I Samuel 14:51,"Now Kish was the father of Sha’ul, and Ner was the father of Avner, the son of Aviel."
I Samuel 14:52,"And the war was strong against the Philistines all the days of Sha’ul;
whenever Sha’ul would see any mighty man, or any valiant one,
he would gather him to him."
I Samuel 15:1,"Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
It is I [whom] Y<small>HWH</small> sent to anoint you as king over his people, over Israel;
so-now, hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>’s words:"
I Samuel 15:2,"Thus says Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High:
I have taken account of what Amalek did to Israel,
how he set upon him on the journey, on his going up from Egypt."
I Samuel 15:3,"Now,
go and strike down Amalek;
you are to devote-to-destruction all that is his
—you are not to spare him,
but are to put to death [everyone]
from man to woman,
from child to suckling,
from ox to sheep,
from camel to donkey!"
I Samuel 15:4,"So Sha’ul summoned the fighting-people
and counted them [for war] in Tela’im:
two hundred thousand foot-soldiers
along with ten thousand, the men of Judah."
I Samuel 15:5,"And Sha’ul came to the city of Amalek,
and lay-in-ambush in the wadi."
I Samuel 15:6,"Now Sha’ul said to the Kenites:
Come, turn aside, go down from amid the Amalekites,
lest I sweep you away with them!
For you—you acted with loyalty with all the Children of Israel on their going up from Egypt.
So the Kenites turned aside from amid Amalek."
I Samuel 15:7,"And Sha’ul struck down Amalek, from Havila as far as where-you- come to Shur, which is facing Egypt."
I Samuel 15:8,"He seized Agag king of Amalek alive,
while all the people he devoted-to-destruction with the mouth of the sword."
I Samuel 15:9,"But Sha’ul and the people spared Agag
and the best of the sheep and the cattle, the fat ones, the lambs and all that was goodly;
they would not devote them to destruction—
[only] all the property despised and rejected,
<i>that</i> they devoted-to-destruction."
I Samuel 15:10,"Now the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Shemuel, saying:"
I Samuel 15:11,"I repent
that I kinged Sha’ul as king,
for he has turned from [following] after me;
my word he has not fulfilled!
Shemuel was agitated,
and he cried out to Y<small>HWH</small> all night."
I Samuel 15:12,"Shemuel started-early to meet Sha’ul at daybreak,
and it was told to Shemuel, saying:
Sha’ul has gone to Carmel
—here, he is setting up a monument for himself—
so he turned about, crossed over, and went down to Gilgal."
I Samuel 15:13,"Shemuel came to Sha’ul,
and Sha’ul said to him:
Blessed are you of Y<small>HWH</small>;
I have fulfilled the word of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Samuel 15:14,"But Shemuel said:
Then what is this sound of sheep in my ears,
and the sound of oxen that I hear?"
I Samuel 15:15,"Sha’ul said:
From the Amalekites they have brought them,
and what the people spared as the best of the sheep and the oxen,
in order to sacrifice them to Y<small>HWH</small> your God;
what was left we devoted-to-destruction."
I Samuel 15:16,"Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
Leave off, and I will tell you what Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to me during the night.
He said to him: Speak!"
I Samuel 15:17,"Shemuel said:
Though you may be too small in your own eyes,
you are head of the tribes of Israel,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has anointed you as king over Israel!"
I Samuel 15:18,"Now Y<small>HWH</small> sent you on a journey;
he said:
Go, devote-to-destruction the sinners, Amalek!
You are to wage battle against them, until you have finished them off."
I Samuel 15:19,"So why did you not hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>?
You swooped down on the spoils
and did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Samuel 15:20,"Sha’ul said to Shemuel:
I did hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>!
I went on the journey on which Y<small>HWH</small> sent me:
I brought back Agag king of Amalek,
while Amalek I devoted-to-destruction;"
I Samuel 15:21,"but the people took from the spoils
sheep and oxen, the premier-part of what was devoted,
to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> your God at Gilgal!"
I Samuel 15:22,"Shemuel said:
Is there pleasure for Y<small>HWH</small> in offerings and sacrifices
more than in hearkening to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>?
Here, hearkening is better than sacrifice,
attention than the fat of rams."
I Samuel 15:23,"Indeed, [like] the sin of diviners is revolt,
[like] the iniquity of <i>terafim</i> is arrogance.
Because you have rejected the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,
he has rejected you as king!"
I Samuel 15:24,"Sha’ul said to Shemuel:
I have sinned;
indeed, I have crossed the order of Y<small>HWH</small> and your words,
for I was afraid of the people,
and so I hearkened to their voice!"
I Samuel 15:25,"But-now,
pray bear away my sin
and return with me, so that I may bow down to Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Samuel 15:26,"Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
I will not return with you,
for you have rejected the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so Y<small>HWH</small> has rejected you from being king over Israel!"
I Samuel 15:27,"And Shemuel turned about to go,
but he held on to the corner of his cloak, so that it tore."
I Samuel 15:28,"Shemuel said to him:
Y<small>HWH</small> has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today
and will give it to your fellow, the one better than you!"
I Samuel 15:29,"And also: the Eternal One of Israel does not speak-falsely and does not repent—
for he is not a human-being, to repent!"
I Samuel 15:30,"He said:
I have sinned—
now, pray honor me in front of the elders of my people, in front of Israel:
return with me, so that I may bow down to Y<small>HWH</small> your God!"
I Samuel 15:31,"So Shemuel returned after Sha’ul,
and Sha’ul bowed down to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 15:32,"Then Shemuel said:
Bring close to me Agag king of Amalek!
Agag went to him with faltering-steps;
Agag said:
Indeed, the distress of death is near!"
I Samuel 15:33,"Shemuel said:
Since bereaved were women by your sword,
may the most bereaved of women be your mother!
And Shemuel slashed Agag [to pieces] in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> at Gilgal."
I Samuel 15:34,"Then Shemuel went back to Rama,
while Sha’ul went up to his house at the Hill of Sha’ul."
I Samuel 15:35,"And Shemuel did not see Sha’ul again until the day of his death,
for Shemuel was mourning over Sha’ul,
while Y<small>HWH</small> had repented that he had made Sha’ul king over Israel."
I Samuel 16:1,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
Until when will you keep on mourning for Sha’ul,
when I myself have rejected him from reigning as king over Israel?
Fill your horn with oil and go:
I am sending you to Yishai the Bet-Lehemite,
for I have seen among his sons a king for me."
I Samuel 16:2,"Shemuel said:
How can I go?
If Sha’ul were to hear, he would kill me!
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
A she-calf of the herd you are to take in your hand,
and you are to say:
It is to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> [that] I have come."
I Samuel 16:3,"Then you are to invite Yishai for the sacrificial-meal,
and I myself will make known to you what you are to do:
you are to anoint for me the one that I tell you."
I Samuel 16:4,"Shemuel did what Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken;
he came to Bet-Lehem.
The elders of the town trembled [going] to meet him,
they said:
Is it in peace, your coming?"
I Samuel 16:5,"He said:
In peace—
it is to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> [that] I have come!
Hallow yourselves,
so that you may come with me to the sacrificial-meal.
So he hallowed Yishai and his sons
and invited them to the sacrificial-meal."
I Samuel 16:6,"Now it was, when they came,
that he saw Eli’av;
he said [to himself]:
Surely before Y<small>HWH</small> is his anointed one!"
I Samuel 16:7,"But Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
Do not look at what you see of him, or at the tallness of his stature,
for I have rejected him!
For [God sees] not as a human being sees—
for a human being sees the [outer] aspect, but Y<small>HWH</small> sees the heart."
I Samuel 16:8,"Then Yishai called Avinadav, and had him pass before Shemuel,
but he said:
Also this one, Y<small>HWH</small> has not chosen."
I Samuel 16:9,"And Yishai had Shamma pass by,
but he said:
Also this one, Y<small>HWH</small> has not chosen."
I Samuel 16:10,"Yishai had his seven sons pass before Shemuel,
but Shemuel said to Yishai:
Y<small>HWH</small> has not chosen these!"
I Samuel 16:11,"Then Shemuel said to Yishai:
Are the lads at-an-end?
He said:
There still remains the youngest—
here, he is shepherding the flock.
Shemuel said to Yishai:
Send and fetch him,
for we will not sit around [the table] until his coming here."
I Samuel 16:12,"He sent and had him come
—now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes, and goodly in appearance.
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Arise, anoint him, for this is he!"
I Samuel 16:13,"So Shemuel took the horn of oil and anointed him amid his brothers.
And the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> advanced upon David from that day and onward.
Then Shemuel arose and went [back] to Rama."
I Samuel 16:14,"Now the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> departed from Sha’ul,
and an evil spirit from Y<small>HWH</small> began to torment him."
I Samuel 16:15,"Sha’ul’s servants said to him:
Now here, an evil spirit of God is tormenting you;"
I Samuel 16:16,"pray let our lord speak—your servants [stand ready] before you:
let them look for a man,
one who knows how to strum the lyre,
so that it may be, whenever there is upon you an evil spirit of God,
he may strum with his hand, and it will be well with you."
I Samuel 16:17,"Sha’ul said to his servants:
Pray select for me a man who strums well,
and have him come to me!"
I Samuel 16:18,"One of the serving-lads spoke up and said:
Here, I have seen a son of Yishai the Bet-Lehemite, [one] who knows how to strum;
a mighty-man of valor,
a man of battle,
skilled in words,
a man of [pleasing] form,
and Y<small>HWH</small> is with him!"
I Samuel 16:19,"So Sha’ul sent messengers to Yishai, he said:
Send me David your son, who is with the flock!"
I Samuel 16:20,"Yishai took a donkey [laden with] bread and a skin of wine, and one goat kid,
and sent them by the hand of David his son, to Sha’ul."
I Samuel 16:21,"David came to Sha’ul, and stood before him;
he grew to love him exceedingly,
and he became his weapons bearer."
I Samuel 16:22,"And Sha’ul sent to Yishai, saying:
Now let David stand [in attendance] before me, for he has found favor in my eyes."
I Samuel 16:23,"And so it would be:
whenever the spirit of God was upon Sha’ul,
that David would take up the lyre and strum [it] with his hand;
Sha’ul would have respite, and it would be well with him,
and the evil spirit would depart from him."
I Samuel 17:1,"Now the Philistines gathered their encampments for battle;
they gathered themselves at Sokho, which is in Yehuda,
and encamped between Sokho and Azeka, at Efes-Dammim,"
I Samuel 17:2,"while Sha’ul and the men of Israel gathered and encamped in the Valley of the Oak,
and arranged-ranks for battle to meet the Philistines."
I Samuel 17:3,"Now the Philistines were stationed on a hill, on this-side,
while Israel was stationed on a hill, on that-side,
with the ravine between them."
I Samuel 17:4,"And the Man of the Space-Between came out, from the Philistine camps—
Golyat his name, from Gat:
his height was six cubits and a span;"
I Samuel 17:5,"a helmet of bronze was on his head,
with armor of scales he was clothed
—the weight of the armor was five thousand <i>shekel</i>-weights of bronze;"
I Samuel 17:6,"greaves of bronze were on his legs,
and a scimitar of bronze was between his shoulders;"
I Samuel 17:7,"the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam,
while the flashing-point of his spear was six hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights of iron,
and the shield bearer was walking before him."
I Samuel 17:8,"He stood and called out to the ranks of Israel;
he said to them:
Why do you come out and arrange-ranks in battle?
Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Sha’ul?
Pick yourselves a man, that he may come down to me!"
I Samuel 17:9,"If he prevails in doing battle with me and strikes me down,
then we will become your servants,
but if I prevail against him and strike him down,
then you will become our servants, and will have to serve us!"
I Samuel 17:10,"And the Philistine said:
As for me,
I mock the ranks of Israel this day—
give me a man, and let us do battle together!"
I Samuel 17:11,"Sha’ul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
and they were dismayed and exceedingly frightened."
I Samuel 17:12,"Now David was the son of this Efratite man, from Bet-Lehem in Judah
whose name was Yishai—he had eight sons.
And the man, in the days of Sha’ul, was old, advanced [in age] among men."
I Samuel 17:13,"Now they had gone, the three oldest sons of Yishai,
gone after Sha’ul, into battle
—the name[s] of his three sons who had gone to battle were:
Eli’av, the firstborn,
and his second, Avinadav,
and the third one, Shamma."
I Samuel 17:14,"As for David, he was the youngest,
while the three oldest ones had gone [to follow] after Sha’ul."
I Samuel 17:15,"Now David would go and return from [attending] upon Sha’ul,
to shepherd the flock of his father in Bet-Lehem."
I Samuel 17:16,"And the Philistine came close, early and late, and presented himself for forty days."
I Samuel 17:17,"Yishai said to David his son:
Now take your brothers this <i>efa</i> of parched-grain, and these ten bread-loaves,
and run them out to the camp to your brothers,"
I Samuel 17:18,"and these ten cuts of milk-cheese, bring to the Commander of a Thousand.
As for your brothers, take account of [their] welfare,
and bring back assurance from them—"
I Samuel 17:19,for Sha’ul and they and all the fighting-men of Israel in the Valley of the Oak are doing battle with the Philistines.
I Samuel 17:20,"So David started-early in the morning;
he left the flock with a watchman,
lifted up [the food] and went, as Yishai had charged him, and came to the circular-camp,
as the army was going out to the ranks and was shouting in battle."
I Samuel 17:21,"And Israel and the Philistines were arranged-in-ranks, rank opposite rank."
I Samuel 17:22,"David let down the gear from him, in the hand of a watchman of gear,
and ran to the ranks.
When he arrived, he asked about his brothers, about [their] welfare."
I Samuel 17:23,"While he was speaking with them,
here, the Man of the Space-Between was coming up, Golyat the Philistine his name, from Gat, from the ranks of the Philistines.
He spoke according to those words, and David heard."
I Samuel 17:24,"Now all the fighting-men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled before him,
for they were exceedingly afraid."
I Samuel 17:25,"A man of Israel said:
Do you see this man who comes up?
Indeed, it is to mock Israel that he comes up!
Now it will be: the man who strikes him down, the king will enrich him with great riches,
and his daughter he will give him,
and his Father’s House he will make free in Israel!"
I Samuel 17:26,"David said to the men who were standing with him, saying:
What shall be done for the man who strikes down this Philistine and removes the mocking from upon Israel?
For who is this foreskinned Philistine
that he should mock the ranks of the Living God?"
I Samuel 17:27,"The people told him according to those words, saying:
Thus shall be done for the man who strikes him down."
I Samuel 17:28,"Now Eli’av his oldest brother heard as he was speaking to the men,
and Eli’av’s anger flared up against David;
he said:
Why now have you come down, and with whom have you left that little flock in the wilderness?
I know your presumption and the evil-intentions of your heart—
indeed, it is in order to see the battle that you have come down here!"
I Samuel 17:29,"David said:
What have I done now? It was only words!"
I Samuel 17:30,"He went around him, facing another,
and spoke to him according to those words,
and the people answered him with words according to the former words."
I Samuel 17:31,"Now the words that David had spoken were heard;
they told them in the presence of Sha’ul, and he had him fetched."
I Samuel 17:32,"David said to Sha’ul:
Do not let anyone’s heart fail him;
your servant will go and do battle with this Philistine!"
I Samuel 17:33,"But Sha’ul said to David:
You cannot prevail in going against this Philistine, to do battle with him,
for you are a lad,
while he has been a man of battle since his youth!"
I Samuel 17:34,"David said to Sha’ul:
Your servant was a shepherd of the flock for his father,
and whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock,"
I Samuel 17:35,"I would go out after it and strike it down, and rescue it from its mouth;
if it rose against me, I would take hold of it by its beard, strike it down, and put it to death."
I Samuel 17:36,"Even the lion, even the bear did your servant strike down—
so this foreskinned Philistine will be like one of them,
for he has mocked the ranks of the Living God!"
I Samuel 17:37,"And David said:
Y<small>HWH</small>,
who rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear,
he will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine!
Sha’ul said to David:
Go, and may Y<small>HWH</small> be with you!"
I Samuel 17:38,"And Sha’ul clothed David in his military-garb:
he placed a helmet of bronze on his head
and clothed him in armor."
I Samuel 17:39,"David strapped on his sword over his garb,
but he was unable to walk, since he was not used [to them].
David said to Sha’ul:
I cannot walk with these, since I am not used [to them].
So David removed them from himself."
I Samuel 17:40,"He took his stick in his hand
and chose himself five smooth stones from the wadi
and put them in the shepherd’s bag that he had, namely, in the pouch, with his sling in his hand,
and approached the Philistine."
I Samuel 17:41,"The Philistine went, going along and coming nearer to David, with the man, the shield bearer, before him."
I Samuel 17:42,"And the Philistine looked out and saw David, and taunted him,
for he was a lad,
and ruddy, beautiful of appearance."
I Samuel 17:43,"The Philistine said to David:
Am I a dog,
that you come at me with sticks?
And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."
I Samuel 17:44,"And the Philistine said to David:
Come to me,
that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field!"
I Samuel 17:45,"But David said to the Philistine:
You come at me
with sword and spear and scimitar,
but I come at you
with the name of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High,
the God of the ranks of Israel, whom you have mocked!"
I Samuel 17:46,"This day Y<small>HWH</small> will turn you over into my hand,
so that I will strike you down
and will remove your head from you;
I will give your carcass and the carcass of the Philistine camp this day
to the birds of the heavens and to the wildlife of the earth,
so that all the earth may know that Israel has a God,"
I Samuel 17:47,"and that all this assembly may know
that it is not with a sword or with a spear that Y<small>HWH</small> delivers—
for the battle is Y<small>HWH</small>’s,
and he will give [all of] you into our hand!"
I Samuel 17:48,"And it was, when the Philistine arose and came near to meet David,
that David quickly ran toward the ranks to meet the Philistine."
I Samuel 17:49,"David stretched out his hand to the bag
and took from there a stone, and slung it,
and struck the Philistine on his forehead:
the stone sank into his forehead
and he fell on his face to the ground."
I Samuel 17:50,"So David overpowered the Philistine with a sling and a stone;
he struck down the Philistine and put him to death,
yet no sword was in David’s hand."
I Samuel 17:51,"And David ran and stood over the Philistine
and took his sword and drew it from its sheath
and dispatched him;
he cut off his head with it.
The Philistines saw that their mighty-man was dead, so they fled,"
I Samuel 17:52,"and the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted;
they pursued after the Philistines as far as where you come to the ravine, as far as the gates of Ekron,
and the Philistine slain fell in the road to Shaarayim/Double-Gate, as far as Gat, as far as Ekron."
I Samuel 17:53,"The Children of Israel returned from dashing-hotly after the Philistines, and they pillaged their camp."
I Samuel 17:54,"And David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem, while his gear he put in his tent."
I Samuel 17:55,"Now when Sha’ul saw David going out to meet the Philistine,
he said to Avner, commander of the armed-forces:
Whose son is this lad, Avner?
Avner said:
As you live, O king, if I know …"
I Samuel 17:56,"The king said:
Make inquiry yourself:
Whose son is this youth?"
I Samuel 17:57,"So when David returned from striking down the Philistine,
Avner took him and brought him before Sha’ul,
with the head of the Philistine in his hand."
I Samuel 17:58,"Sha’ul said to him:
Whose son are you, [my] lad?
David said:
The son of your servant Yishai the Bet-Lehemite."
I Samuel 18:1,"It was, when he finished speaking to Sha’ul,
—now Yehonatan’s own self became bound up with David’s self,
so that Yehonatan loved him like his own self—"
I Samuel 18:2,"that Sha’ul took him [into service] on that day,
and did not give him [leave] to return to his Father’s House."
I Samuel 18:3,"And Yehonatan and David cut a covenant,
because of his love for him, like his own self."
I Samuel 18:4,"Yehonatan stripped off the cloak that he had on and gave it to David,
along with his [military] garb, including his sword, including his bow, and including his belt."
I Samuel 18:5,"David went out,
and everywhere that Sha’ul sent him, he prospered.
Sha’ul placed him over the men of war,
and it was good in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of Sha’ul’s servants."
I Samuel 18:6,"And it was upon their coming back, upon David’s return from striking the Philistine,
that women came out from all the towns in Israel, for singing and dances,
to meet King Sha’ul with timbrels, with joyful-sounds and with triangles."
I Samuel 18:7,"And the dancing women chanted and said:
Sha’ul has struck down his thousands,
but David—his myriads!"
I Samuel 18:8,"Sha’ul became exceedingly agitated,
and this matter was evil in his eyes;
he said [to himself]:
They give-credit to David for myriads,
but to me they give-credit for thousands!
There yet [remains] for him only the kingdom!"
I Samuel 18:9,And Sha’ul was keeping-an-eye on David from that day onward.
I Samuel 18:10,"Now it was on the morrow
that an evil spirit of God advanced upon Sha’ul, and he ranted-like- a-prophet in the midst of the palace-house,
while David was strumming with his hand, as day after day.
Now there was a spear in Sha’ul’s hand,"
I Samuel 18:11,"and Sha’ul hurled the spear; he said [to himself]:
I will strike David and the wall [together]!
But David evaded him twice."
I Samuel 18:12,"And Sha’ul was afraid before David,
for Y<small>HWH</small> was with him,
while from Sha’ul he had turned away."
I Samuel 18:13,"So Sha’ul kept him away from [being] beside him;
he made him commander of a thousand,
and he went out and came back before the people."
I Samuel 18:14,"David was prospering in all his ways,
and Y<small>HWH</small> was with him."
I Samuel 18:15,"And Sha’ul saw that he was prospering exceedingly, and he was in dread before him,"
I Samuel 18:16,"but all Israel and Judah loved David,
for he was going out and coming back before them."
I Samuel 18:17,"Sha’ul said to David:
Here is my oldest daughter, Merav—
her I will give you as a wife;
only be a son of valor for me
and fight the battles of Y<small>HWH</small>!
—For Sha’ul said [to himself]:
Let not my own hand be against him,
but let the Philistines’ hand be against him!"
I Samuel 18:18,"David said to Sha’ul:
Who am I and who are my living-relatives, my father’s clan in Israel,
that I should become son-in-law to the king?"
I Samuel 18:19,"But it was,
at the time for giving Merav daughter of Sha’ul to David,
that she was given to Adriel the Maholatite as a wife."
I Samuel 18:20,"Now Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul had fallen in love with David,
and when it was told to Sha’ul, the matter was right in his eyes."
I Samuel 18:21,"Sha’ul said [to himself]:
I will give her to him,
that she may become a snare to him,
and that the Philistines’ hand may be against him!
So Sha’ul said to David a second-time:
You are to become-a-son-in-law to me today!"
I Samuel 18:22,"And Sha’ul charged his servants:
Speak to David secretly, saying:
Here, the king is pleased with you,
and all his servants love you;
so-now, become-a-son-in-law to the king!"
I Samuel 18:23,"Sha’ul’s servants spoke these words in David’s ears.
But David said:
Is it a light-thing in your eyes, becoming-a-son-in-law to the king
—for I am a man poor and lightly-regarded!"
I Samuel 18:24,"Sha’ul’s servants told him, saying:
According to these words did David speak."
I Samuel 18:25,"Sha’ul said:
Say thus to David:
The king takes no pleasure in any bride-price except for a hundred Philistine foreskins,
to be avenged on the king’s enemies
—for Sha’ul planned to cause David’s fall by the Philistines’ hand."
I Samuel 18:26,"His servants told David all these words,
and the matter was right in David’s eyes to become-son-in-law to the king.
Not [many] days were fulfilled"
I Samuel 18:27,"when David arose and went, he and his men,
and he struck down two hundred men of the Philistines.
And David brought their foreskins and paid-them-in-full to the king,
to become-son-in-law to the king,
and Sha’ul gave him Mikhal his daughter as a wife."
I Samuel 18:28,"Sha’ul took note and knew that Y<small>HWH</small> was with David,
while Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul loved him."
I Samuel 18:29,"And Sha’ul continued to be afraid of David, even more;
Sha’ul was bearing-enmity to David all the days."
I Samuel 18:30,"The Philistine commanders went out [to battle],
and it was: as often as they went out, David prospered more than all of Sha’ul’s servants,
so that his name became exceedingly esteemed."
I Samuel 19:1,"And Sha’ul spoke to Yonatan his son and to all his servants
about causing David’s death,
but Yehonatan son of Sha’ul took exceeding pleasure in David,"
I Samuel 19:2,"so Yehonatan told David, saying:
Sha’ul my father is seeking to cause your death.
So-now, pray take care in the morning
that you stay in a secret-place and hide yourself."
I Samuel 19:3,"As for me, I will go out and stand next to my father in the field where you are;
I myself will speak about you to my father,
and whatever I see, I will tell you."
I Samuel 19:4,"So Yehonatan spoke of David for good to Sha’ul his father;
he said to him:
Let not the king sin against his servant, against David,
for he has not sinned against you,
for his deeds have been exceedingly to your good!"
I Samuel 19:5,"He took his life in his hands and struck down the Philistine,
and Y<small>HWH</small> wrought a great victory for all Israel
—you saw it and rejoiced.
So why would you sin against innocent blood
by causing David’s death for nothing?"
I Samuel 19:6,"Sha’ul hearkened to Yehonatan’s voice,
and Sha’ul swore:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, if he should be put to death … !"
I Samuel 19:7,"So Yehonatan called David,
and Yehonatan told him all these words.
Yehonatan brought David to Sha’ul,
and he was in his presence as yesterday [and] the day-before."
I Samuel 19:8,"The battles continued to take place;
David went out to wage battle against the Philistines,
and he struck them down, a great striking-down,
so that they fled before them."
I Samuel 19:9,"But an evil spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] upon Sha’ul:
he was sitting in his palace-house, his spear in his hand,
while David was strumming with his hand."
I Samuel 19:10,"And Sha’ul sought to strike, with the spear, David and the wall [together],
but he slipped away from Sha’ul,
so that he struck [only] the wall with his spear,
and David fled, and escaped on that night."
I Samuel 19:11,"Sha’ul sent messengers to David’s house, to watch out for him and to put him to death at daybreak,
but Mikhal, David’s wife, reported to him, saying:
If you don’t escape with your life tonight,
tomorrow you will be put to death!"
I Samuel 19:12,"So Mikhal let David down through the window;
he went off, got away, and escaped."
I Samuel 19:13,"Then Mikhal took the <i>terafim</i> and put it in the bed,
and a tangle of goats’-hair she put at its head,
and covered it with a garment."
I Samuel 19:14,"And when Sha’ul sent messengers to take David, she said:
He is sick."
I Samuel 19:15,"Then Sha’ul sent the messengers to see David, saying:
Bring him up in the bed to me, to put him to death!"
I Samuel 19:16,"But when the mesengers arrived,
here, the <i>terafim</i> were in the bed, with a tangle of goats’-hair at its head!"
I Samuel 19:17,"Sha’ul said to Mikhal:
Why have you deceived me thus?
You have sent my enemy free, so that he has escaped!
Mikhal said to Sha’ul:
He said to me: Send me free—
why should I cause your death?"
I Samuel 19:18,"Now David had gotten away and escaped, coming to Shemuel at Rama,
and had told him all that Sha’ul had done to him.
He went, he and Shemuel, and they stayed at Nayot."
I Samuel 19:19,"Now it was told to Sha’ul, saying:
Here, David is at Nayot in Rama!"
I Samuel 19:20,"So Sha’ul sent messengers to fetch David,
and they saw a group of prophets ranting-in-prophecy,
with Shemuel standing [there], stationed over them.
And there [came] upon Sha’ul’s messengers the spirit of God,
so that they ranted-like-prophets, they too."
I Samuel 19:21,"They told Sha’ul,
and he sent other messengers,
but they ranted-like-prophets, they too.
And Sha’ul again sent, a third [group of] messengers,
but they ranted-like-prophets, they too."
I Samuel 19:22,"So he went, he too, to Rama;
he arrived at the great cistern that is in Sekhu,
and made inquiry, and said:
Where are Shemuel and David?
They said:
Here, in Nayot in Rama."
I Samuel 19:23,"So he went there, to Nayot in Rama,
and there [came] upon him, him too, the spirit of God;
he went, going along and ranting-like-a-prophet, until he arrived at the shepherds’-camps in Rama."
I Samuel 19:24,"And he stripped off, he too, his garments,
and ranted-like-a-prophet, he too, before Shemuel;
he fell down naked all that day and all night.
Therefore they say:
Is Sha’ul too among the prophets?"
I Samuel 20:1,"Now David had gotten away from Nayot in Rama;
he came and said before Yehonatan:
What have I done?
What is my iniquity, what is my sin before your father,
that he seeks my life?"
I Samuel 20:2,"He said to him:
[Heaven] forbid!
You will not die—
here, my father does not do anything great or anything small without baring my ear.
So for-what-reason should my father hide this matter from me?
This cannot [be]!"
I Samuel 20:3,"David swore again and said:
Your father knows, yes, knows
that I have found favor in your eyes,
so he has said [to himself]:
Yehonatan is not to know about this, lest he be pained;
but: by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, and by your life,
indeed, there is only something like a step between me and death!"
I Samuel 20:4,"Yehonatan said to David:
Whatever you yourself say, I will do for you."
I Samuel 20:5,"David said to Yehonatan:
Here, the New-Moon is tomorrow,
when I must sit, yes, sit beside the king to eat;
send me away, and I will hide in the open-field, until the third sunset."
I Samuel 20:6,"Now if your father takes account, yes, account of my [absence]
and you say: David requested, yes, requested-leave for himself from me to run back to Bet-Lehem his town,
for the yearly sacrificial-meal is there, for the entire clan—"
I Samuel 20:7,"if he says thus: Good!
it is well for your servant.
But if he is agitated, yes, agitated,
know that evil has been determined by him."
I Samuel 20:8,"So act with loyalty toward your servant,
for you brought your servant into Y<small>HWH</small>’s covenant with you.
Now if there be any iniquity in me,
put me to death yourself,
so to your father, why then should you bring me?"
I Samuel 20:9,"Yehonatan said:
[Heaven] forbid for you!
If I were to know, yes, know that evil is determined by my father to come against you,
would I not tell that to you?"
I Samuel 20:10,"David said to Yehonatan:
Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?"
I Samuel 20:11,"Yehonatan said to David:
Come, let us go out to the field.
The two of them went out to the field."
I Samuel 20:12,"And Yehonatan said to David:
By Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
when I have sounded out my father at this time tomorrow [or] the third [day],
and here: good is [determined] toward David,
shall I not then send to you and bare your ear?"
I Samuel 20:13,"Thus may Y<small>HWH</small> do to Yehonatan, and thus may he add:
if it seems good to my father, the evil [determined] against you,
I will bare your ear
and will send you away, that you may go in peace.
And may Y<small>HWH</small> be with you, as he was with my father!"
I Samuel 20:14,"Will you not, while I am still alive,
will you not deal with me in the loyalty of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so that I do not die?"
I Samuel 20:15,"You must not cut off your loyalty from my house, for the ages,
not even when Y<small>HWH</small> cuts off David’s enemies, each one from the face of the ground!"
I Samuel 20:16,"Yehonatan has cut [a covenant] with the House of David;
may Y<small>HWH</small> seek it from the hand of “David’s enemies”!"
I Samuel 20:17,"And Yehonatan swore to David again, by his love for him,
for he loved him with the love [he had] for his own self.
Then Yehonatan said to him:"
I Samuel 20:18,"Tomorrow is the New-Moon;
you will be counted-missing, for your seat will be counted-empty."
I Samuel 20:19,"When you are three-days-gone, go down exceedingly [quickly],
and when you come to the place where you were hiding at the time of the incident,
you are to sit near that stone."
I Samuel 20:20,"As for me, I will shoot three arrows to the side, to send them flying from me at a target."
I Samuel 20:21,"And here, I will send the serving-lad toward you, [saying]:
Go, find the arrows!
If I say, yes, say to the lad:
Here, the arrows are [to the side] of you, over there—
take them and come back, for it is well for you,
there is no problem, by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 20:22,"But if I say thus to the boy:
Here, the arrows are [to the side] of you, farther onward—go,
for Y<small>HWH</small> will have sent you away."
I Samuel 20:23,"And as for the promise that we have spoken, I and you,
here, Y<small>HWH</small> will be between me and you, for the ages!"
I Samuel 20:24,"So David hid in the open-field.
Now it was at the New-Moon, that the king sat by the food, to eat,"
I Samuel 20:25,"and the king sat in his seat as time and time [before],
in the seat by the wall.
Yehonatan was at-the-ffont, and Avner sat at the side of Sha’ul,
while David’s place was counted-empty."
I Samuel 20:26,"Now Sha’ul did not say anything on that day,
for he said [to himself]:
It is an accident;
he is not ritually-pure, for he has not been purified."
I Samuel 20:27,"But it was on the morrow of the New-Moon, on the second [day],
that David’s place was counted-empty.
So Sha’ul said to Yehonatan his son:
For-what-reason has the son of Yishai not come, even yesterday, even today, to the food?"
I Samuel 20:28,"Yehonatan answered Sha’ul:
David requested, yes, requested-leave for himself from me, to Bet- Lehem;"
I Samuel 20:29,"he said: Pray send me off,
for it is the sacrificial-meal of the clan for us in the town,
and my brother charged me.
So-now, if I have found favor in your eyes,
pray let me get away, that I may see my brothers.
Therefore he has not come to the king’s table."
I Samuel 20:30,"Sha’ul’s anger flared up against Yehonatan;
he said to him:
[You] son of a twisted rebellion!
Don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Yishai,
to your shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?"
I Samuel 20:31,"For all the days that the son of Yishai is alive on the earth,
you will not be firmly-established, you or your kingdom!
So-now,
send and fetch him to me,
for he is a son of death!"
I Samuel 20:32,"Yehonatan answered Sha’ul his father;
he said to him:
Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
I Samuel 20:33,"But Sha’ul hurled the spear at him, to strike him down,
and so Yehonatan knew
that his father had determined to put David to death."
I Samuel 20:34,"Yehonatan arose from the table in blazing anger;
he did not eat food on the second day of the New-Moon,
since he was pained about David,
since his father had humiliated him."
I Samuel 20:35,"So it was at daybreak,
that Yehonatan went out to the open-field to the appointment with David,
a young serving-lad with him."
I Samuel 20:36,"He said to his lad: Run, now find the arrows that I shoot!
As the lad ran, he shot an arrow past him,"
I Samuel 20:37,"and when the lad came to the place of the arrow that Yehonatan had shot,
Yehonatan called after the lad, he said:
Isn’t the arrow [to the side] of you, and farther onward?"
I Samuel 20:38,"And Yehonatan called after the lad:
Quick! Hurry! Don’t stand still!
So Yehonatan’s serving-lad collected the arrows and brought them to his lord."
I Samuel 20:39,"Now the lad knew nothing;
only Yehonatan and David knew about the matter."
I Samuel 20:40,"And Yehonatan gave his weapons to the lad that he had;
he said to him:
Go, bring [these back] to the town."
I Samuel 20:41,"When the lad went off,
David arose from beside the mound,
flung himself on his nostrils to the ground, and bowed low three times,
and each one kissed his fellow,
each one wept with his fellow, until David [had wept] a great deal."
I Samuel 20:42,"Yehonatan said to David:
Go in peace,
[seeing] that the two of us, [even] we, have sworn in the name of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
May Y<small>HWH</small> be between me and you, between my seed and your seed, for the ages!"
I Samuel 21:1,"He arose and went away,
while Yehonatan came back to the town."
I Samuel 21:2,"David came to Nov, to Ahimelekh the priest.
And Ahimelekh trembled [coming] to meet David;
he said to him:
For-what-reason are you alone, and no one with you?"
I Samuel 21:3,"David said to Ahimelekh the priest:
The king has charged me with a matter,
he said to me:
No one is to know anything of the matter on which I am sending you, with which I have charged you!
And with the serving-lads I have made-appointment at such and so a place."
I Samuel 21:4,"So-now,
what do you have on hand?
Give five [rounds of] bread into my hand, or whatever is found."
I Samuel 21:5,"The priest answered David and said:
There is no ordinary bread on hand,
only hallowed bread is there—
provided that the lads have kept themselves away, of course, from women."
I Samuel 21:6,"David answered the priest;
he said to him:
Certainly women have been held back from us, so yesterday [and] the day-before;
whenever I went out, the lads’ gear was hallowed, even [if it was] an ordinary journey—
how much more so today the gear should be hallowed!"
I Samuel 21:7,"So the priest gave him hallowed [bread],
for there was no bread there except for the Bread of the Presence that was removed from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
for [them] to put warm bread [there] at the time of its being taken away."
I Samuel 21:8,"Now a man was there from the servants of Sha’ul that day,
held-in-custody in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
his name was Do’eg the Edomite,
chief of the shepherds that belonged to Sha’ul."
I Samuel 21:9,"David said to Ahimelekh:
Don’t you have on hand here a spear or a sword?
For neither my sword nor my weapons did I take along in my hand,
for the matter of the king was urgent!"
I Samuel 21:10,"The priest said:
The sword of Golyat the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of the Oak—
here it is, wrapped up in a cloth, behind the <i>efod.</i>
If it is what you wish to take for yourself, take it,
for there is no other one besides it in this [place].
David said: There is none like it—give it to me!"
I Samuel 21:11,"And David arose
and got away on that day from before Sha’ul,
and came to Akhish king of Gat."
I Samuel 21:12,"Now the servants of Akhish said to him:
Isn’t this David, the king of the land?
Isn’t it about this one that they chant in [their] dances, saying:
Sha’ul has struck down his thousands,
but David—his myriads!?"
I Samuel 21:13,"David took these words to heart, and was exceedingly afraid in the presence of Akhish king of Gat,"
I Samuel 21:14,"so he altered his demeanor in their eyes
and acted deranged [while] in their hands:
he drummed on the doors of the gate
and let his spittle run down his beard."
I Samuel 21:15,"And Akhish said to his servants:
Here, look at this one acting-like-a-madman!
Why do you bring him to me?"
I Samuel 21:16,"Do I lack madmen
that you have brought this one to act-like-a-madman around me?
Should this one come into my house?"
I Samuel 22:1,"David went from there and escaped to the Cave of Adullam.
His brothers and his whole Father’s House heard,
and they went down to him there."
I Samuel 22:2,"And there gathered to him every man in straits, every man who had a creditor, and every man of bitter feelings,
and he became commander over them.
And there were with him about four hundred men."
I Samuel 22:3,"David went from there to Mitzpe / Lookout of Moav;
he said to the king of Moav:
Pray let my father and my mother stay with you
until I know what God [intends to] do with me."
I Samuel 22:4,"So he led them into the presence of the king of Moav, and they stayed with him, all the days of David’s being at the stronghold."
I Samuel 22:5,"But the prophet Gad said to David:
You are not to stay at the stronghold;
go, come on your [way] to the land of Judah.
So David went and came to the Forest of Heret."
I Samuel 22:6,"And Sha’ul heard that [the whereabouts of] David were known, and of the men that were with him.
Now Sha’ul was staying at Giv’a, under a tamarisk at Rama, with his spear in his hand,
and all his servants were standing-in-attendance around him."
I Samuel 22:7,"Sha’ul said to his servants who were standing around him:
Now hearken, O Binyaminites:
Is it really to all of you that the son of Yishai will give fields and vineyards?
Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,"
I Samuel 22:8,"that all of you have banded together against me?
No one bares my ear when my son cuts [a covenant] with the son of Yishai;
none of you is concerned about me or bares my ear
[to reveal] that my son has raised up my servant against me as an ambusher, as is this day!"
I Samuel 22:9,"Then Do’eg the Edomite spoke up
—he was standing around the servants of Sha’ul—
and said:
I saw the son of Yishai come to Nov, to Ahimelekh son of Ahituv;"
I Samuel 22:10,"he inquired for him of Y<small>HWH</small>, and provisions he gave him,
and the sword of Golyat the Philistine he gave him!"
I Samuel 22:11,"So the king sent to call Ahimelekh son of Ahituv the priest
along with all his Father’s House, the priests who were at Nov,
and all of them came to the king."
I Samuel 22:12,"Sha’ul said:
Now hearken, son of Ahituv!
He said:
Here I am, my lord."
I Samuel 22:13,"Sha’ul said to him:
Why have you banded together against me, you and the son of Yishai,
by your giving him food and a sword
and inquiring for him of God,
to rise up against me as an ambusher, as is this day?"
I Samuel 22:14,"Ahimelekh answered the king, he said:
But who among all your servants is like David—trustworthy,
the king’s son-in-law,
commander over your obedient-bodyguard,
and honored in your house?"
I Samuel 22:15,"[Only] today I first inquired for him of God—[Heaven] forbid for me:
do not let the king place an accusing-word against his servant, against all my Father’s House,
for your servant did not know about all this, anything small or great!"
I Samuel 22:16,"But the king said:
You shall die, yes, die, Ahimelekh,
you and all your Father’s House!"
I Samuel 22:17,"And the king said to the outrunners who were standing around him:
Turn about and put to death the priests of Y<small>HWH</small>,
because their hand too is with David,
and because they knew that he was getting away and did not bare my ear!
But the king’s servants would not stretch out their hand to attack the priests of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Samuel 22:18,"so the king said to Do’eg:
<i>You</i> turn about and attack the priests!
So Do’eg the Edomite turned about, and <i>he</i> attacked the priests:
he put to death on that day eighty-five men wearing a linen <i>efod,</i>"
I Samuel 22:19,"and as for Nov, the town of the priests, he struck it with the mouth of the sword,
from man to woman
and from child to suckling,
and ox and donkey and sheep,
with the mouth of the sword."
I Samuel 22:20,"But one son of Ahimelekh son of Ahituv escaped—his name was Evyatar;
he got away to David."
I Samuel 22:21,"And Evyatar told David
that Sha’ul had killed the priests of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 22:22,"David said to Evyatar:
I knew that day, when Do’eg the Edomite was there,
that he would tell, yes, tell Sha’ul.
I myself am responsible for every life in your Father’s House!"
I Samuel 22:23,"Stay with me, and do not be afraid,
for they must [first] seek my life who seek your life;
indeed, you will be under care with me!"
I Samuel 23:1,"They told David, saying:
Here, the Philistines are waging battle against Ke’ila,
they are pillaging the threshing-floors!"
I Samuel 23:2,"David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Shall I go and strike these Philistines?
Y<small>HWH</small> said to David:
Go and strike the Philistines, and deliver Ke’ila!"
I Samuel 23:3,"Now David’s men said to him:
Look, we are here in Judah, afraid;
shall we really go to Ke’ila, against the Philistine ranks?"
I Samuel 23:4,"So David once again inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and Y<small>HWH</small> answered him, he said:
Arise, go down to Ke’ila,
for I give the Philistines into your hand!"
I Samuel 23:5,"So David went, along with his men, to Ke’ila,
and he waged battle against the Philistines:
he led away their livestock and struck them down, a great striking- down.
Thus David delivered the settled-folk of Ke’ila."
I Samuel 23:6,"—Now it was, when Evyatar son of Ahimelekh had gotten away to David, to Ke’ila,
that an <i>efod</i> had come down in his hand.—"
I Samuel 23:7,"It was told to Sha’ul that David had come to Ke’ila, and Sha’ul said:
God has transferred him into my hand,
for he has turned himself over by entering a town with gates and bars!"
I Samuel 23:8,"So Sha’ul summoned all the fighting-people for battle,
to come down to Ke’ila, to besiege David and his men."
I Samuel 23:9,"And David realized that Sha’ul was concocting evil against him,
so he said to Evyatar the priest: Bring the <i>efod</i> close!"
I Samuel 23:10,"Then David said:
O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel,
your servant has heard, yes, heard
that Sha’ul is seeking to enter Ke’ila, to bring-ruin to the town on my account."
I Samuel 23:11,"Will the inhabitants of Ke’ila turn me over to his hand?
Will Sha’ul come down, as your servant has heard?
O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel,
now tell your servant.…
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
He will come down."
I Samuel 23:12,"David said:
Will the inhabitants of Ke’ila turn me over, along with my men, into the hand of Sha’ul?
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
They will turn [you] over."
I Samuel 23:13,"So David and his men arose, some six hundred men;
they moved out from Ke’ila, and went about wherever they could go about.
Now when it was told to Sha’ul that David had escaped from Ke’ila,
he held back from moving out."
I Samuel 23:14,"And David stayed in the wilderness, in the strongholds;
he stayed in the highlands, in the Wilderness of Zif,
and Sha’ul sought him all the days,
but God did not give him into his hand."
I Samuel 23:15,"And David saw that Sha’ul was going forth to seek his life
—David was in the Wilderness of Zif, in the woods."
I Samuel 23:16,"But Yehonatan son of Sha’ul arose and went to David in the woods;
he strengthened his hand in God"
I Samuel 23:17,"and said to him:
Do not be afraid,
for the hand of Sha’ul my father will not find you;
you yourself will reign as king over Israel,
and I myself will be second-in-command to you.
Even Sha’ul my father knows this!"
I Samuel 23:18,"So the two of them cut a covenant in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>.
And David stayed in the woods, while Yehonatan went back to his house."
I Samuel 23:19,"Some Zifites went up to Sha’ul at Giv’a, saying:
Is not David hiding himself among us in the strongholds in the woods,
at the Hill of Hakhila which is to the right/south of the wasteland?"
I Samuel 23:20,"So-now, according to all your craving, O king, to come down— come down,
and [it will be] our [task], turning him over to the king’s hand."
I Samuel 23:21,"Sha’ul said:
Blessed are you of Y<small>HWH</small>,
that you have taken pity on me!"
I Samuel 23:22,"Now go, be determined once-again,
know and take-note of his place where his foot is [now and] who has seen him there,
for they have said to me that he acts-shrewdly, yes, shrewdly."
I Samuel 23:23,"So take-note and know
in which of all the hiding-places he hides himself,
and return to me when it is determined;
then I will go with you,
and it will be: if he is in the region,
I will search for him among all the thousands of Judah."
I Samuel 23:24,"They arose and went to Zif, ahead of Sha’ul,
while David and his men were in the Wilderness of Ma’on/Abode, in the plain to the right of the wasteland."
I Samuel 23:25,"And Sha’ul and his men went to seek [him],
and it was told to David,
so he went down to a certain crag and stayed in the Wilderness of Ma’on.
Sha’ul heard, and pursued after David, in the Wilderness of Ma’on:"
I Samuel 23:26,"Sha’ul went on [one] side of a hill, over-here,
with David and his men on the [other] side of the hill, over-there.
Now David was hastening to get away from Sha’ul,
while Sha’ul and his men were closing in on David and his men, to seize them."
I Samuel 23:27,"But a messenger came to Sha’ul, saying:
Come quickly,
for Philistines are sweeping down on the region!"
I Samuel 23:28,"So Sha’ul had to turn back from pursuing after David;
he went to meet the Philistines.
Therefore that place was called: Crag of the Parting."
I Samuel 24:1,"And David went up from there
and stayed in the strongholds of En-Gedi."
I Samuel 24:2,"Now it was, when Sha’ul returned from [chasing] after the Philistines,
that it was told to him, saying:
Here, David is in the Wilderness of En-Gedi!"
I Samuel 24:3,"So Sha’ul took three thousand men, hand-picked from all Israel,
and went to seek out David and his men, in front of the Wild-Goat Rocks."
I Samuel 24:4,"He came to some sheep pens along the way, and there was a cave there,
and Sha’ul went in to “cover his feet,”
while David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave."
I Samuel 24:5,"And David’s men said to him:
Here is the day about which Y<small>HWH</small> said to you:
Here, I give your enemy into your hand!
You may do with him whatever seems good in your eyes!
And David arose and cut off the corner of the cloak that belonged to Sha’ul, discreetly."
I Samuel 24:6,"But it was after that
that David’s heart struck him,
because he had cut off the corner that belonged to Sha’ul."
I Samuel 24:7,"He said to his men:
[Heaven] forbid for me from Y<small>HWH</small>
if I should do this thing to my lord, to Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed,
to stretch out my hand against him,
for he is Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed!"
I Samuel 24:8,"David checked his men with [these] words,
and did not give them [leave] to rise up against Sha’ul,
while Sha’ul arose from the cave, and went on his way."
I Samuel 24:9,"But David arose after that
and came out of the cave, and he called out after Sha’ul, saying:
My lord king!"
I Samuel 24:10,"and David said to Sha’ul:
Why do you hearken to the words of anyone [who] says:
Here, David is seeking evil-against-you?"
I Samuel 24:11,"Here, this day your eyes have seen
that Y<small>HWH</small> gave you today into my hand, in the cave;
they intended to kill you,
but I had compassion on you:
I said [to myself]:
I will not stretch out my hand against my lord,
for he is Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed!"
I Samuel 24:12,"And Father, see too:
see the corner of your cloak in my hand—
for when I cut off the corner of your cloak,
I did not kill you!
[So] know and take-note that there is no evil or transgression in my hand,
nor have I sinned against you—
yet you are stalking my life, to take it!"
I Samuel 24:13,"May Y<small>HWH</small> judge between me and you,
and may Y<small>HWH</small> avenge me upon you—
but <i>my</i> hand shall not be against you!"
I Samuel 24:14,"As the proverb of the ancients says: From the wicked comes wickedness.
But my hand shall not be against you!"
I Samuel 24:15,"After whom has the king of Israel gone out?
After whom are you pursuing?
After a dead dog?
After a single flea?"
I Samuel 24:16,"May Y<small>HWH</small> be the one-who-decides, and judge between me and you:
when he sees, may he uphold my cause
and exact justice from your hand!"
I Samuel 24:17,"Now it was, when David had finished speaking these words to Sha’ul,
that Sha’ul said:
Is that your voice, my son David?
And Sha’ul lifted up his voice and wept;"
I Samuel 24:18,"he said to David:
You are in the right, more than I,
for you have dealt with me for good, while I have dealt with you for evil!"
I Samuel 24:19,"And you have told me today
how you have done good with me,
how Y<small>HWH</small> turned me over to your hand, yet you did not kill me."
I Samuel 24:20,"If a man comes upon his enemy,
does he send him off on the way in good-condition?
May Y<small>HWH</small> pay you back in-good-measure for this day,
for what you have done with me!"
I Samuel 24:21,"So-now, here: I know
that you will reign as king, yes, king,
and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand;"
I Samuel 24:22,"so-now, swear to me by Y<small>HWH</small>:
if you should cut off my seed after me,
if you should wipe out my name from my Father’s House … !"
I Samuel 24:23,"And David swore to Sha’ul.
Then Sha’ul went back to his house,
while David and his men went up to the stronghold."
I Samuel 25:1,"Shemuel died;
all Israel gathered and beat [the breast] for him,
and they buried him at his house in Rama.
Then David arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ma’on."
I Samuel 25:2,"Now [there was] a man in Ma’on, with his business in Carmel,
and the man was exceedingly great [in wealth]:
he had sheep, three thousand, and a thousand goats,
and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."
I Samuel 25:3,"The man’s name was Naval,
and his wife’s name was Avigayil.
Now the woman was of good sense, and beautiful of form,
but the man was rough and evil in deeds;
he was a Calevite."
I Samuel 25:4,"And David heard in the wilderness that Naval was shearing his sheep,"
I Samuel 25:5,"so David sent ten serving-lads,
and David said to the lads:
Go up to Carmel
and come to Naval, and inquire of him in my name for peace,"
I Samuel 25:6,"and say thus: To Life!
[May] you [be in] peace, your house [be in] peace, and all that belongs to you [be in] peace!"
I Samuel 25:7,"So-now, I have heard that you have shearers;
now: the shepherds that belong to you were with us—
we did not hurt them,
and nothing has been unaccounted for by them,
all the time of our being in Carmel."
I Samuel 25:8,"Inquire of your lads, and they will tell you.
So may [my] lads find favor in your eyes,
for upon a good day we have come—
now give whatever you can find in your hand to your servant, to your son David!"
I Samuel 25:9,"So David’s lads came
and spoke to Naval according to all these words, in David’s name,
and then they stood-at-ease."
I Samuel 25:10,"Naval answered David’s servants; he said:
Who is David? Who is the son of Yishai?
Nowadays there are many servants who break away, each one from his lord!"
I Samuel 25:11,"So should I take away my bread, my water and my butchered-meat that I butchered for my shearers,
and give it to men who are from I don’t know where?"
I Samuel 25:12,"David’s lads turned about, [back] on their way;
they returned and came and told him in accordance with all these words."
I Samuel 25:13,"Then David said to his men:
Each one gird on his sword!
Each one girded on his sword,
and also David girded on his sword;
they went up behind David, about four hundred men,
while two hundred stayed with the gear."
I Samuel 25:14,"Now Avigayil wife of Naval
was told by a lad from among the serving-lads, saying:
Here, David sent messengers from the wilderness to give blessing- of-greeting to our lord,
but he shrieked at them."
I Samuel 25:15,"Now the men were exceedingly good to us;
we were not hurt, we did not [find] anything unaccounted for
all the days we went about with them, during our being in the open-field;"
I Samuel 25:16,"they were a wall about us,
even by day, even by night,
all the days we were beside them herding the sheep."
I Samuel 25:17,"So-now,
know and take-note what you should do,
for evil is concluded against our lord and against his entire house!
But he is [too] base a fellow for speaking to!"
I Samuel 25:18,"Avigayil quickly took two hundred loaves-of-bread and two skins of wine,
five sheep made ready and five <i>sei’as</i> of parched-grain
and a hundred raisin-cakes and two hundred pressed-figs,
and she put them on some donkeys."
I Samuel 25:19,"Then she said to her lads:
Cross on ahead of me,
here, I will be coming behind you—
but her husband Naval she did not tell."
I Samuel 25:20,"Now she was riding on the donkey, going down a covert in a hill:
but here were David and his men, going down toward her,
and she encountered them."
I Samuel 25:21,"Now David had said [to himself]:
Surely in vain did I keep-safe all that belongs to this one in the wilderness,
though from all that belongs to him, nothing was unaccounted for—
he has returned to me evil in place of good!"
I Samuel 25:22,"Thus may God do to “the enemies of” David, and thus may he add,
if I leave from all that belongs to him, by daybreak, [even] one pissing against the wall!"
I Samuel 25:23,"When Avigayil saw David,
she quickly got down from the donkey
flung herself before David, on her face,
and bowed low to the ground."
I Samuel 25:24,"She flung herself at his feet and said:
On <i>me,</i> my lord, be the iniquity!
Now let your maidservant speak in your ear,
and hearken to the words of your maidservant:"
I Samuel 25:25,"now let not my lord pay any mind to this base man, to Naval,
for as his name is, so is he:
Naval/Vile-One is his name, and vileness is with him!
But as for me, your maidservant,
I did not see my lord’s lads whom you sent."
I Samuel 25:26,"So-now, my lord,
by the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your life,
[given] that Y<small>HWH</small> has prevented you from coming into blood-guilt,
namely, delivering yourself by your hand [alone]—
so-now,
may your enemies be like Naval,
yes, those who seek evil against my lord!"
I Samuel 25:27,"And now,
this token-of-blessing that your handmaid has brought to my lord,
let it be given to the lads who go about in my lord’s footsteps."
I Samuel 25:28,"O bear-in-forgiveness the transgression of your maidservant,
for when Y<small>HWH</small> makes, yes, makes for my lord a secure house
—for the battles of Y<small>HWH</small> does my lord fight,
and no evil may be found in you [all] your days—"
I Samuel 25:29,"should anyone arise to pursue you, to seek your life,
may my lord’s life be bound up in the bundle of life with Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
but may the life of your enemies be slung away in the hollow of a sling!"
I Samuel 25:30,"And may it be,
when Y<small>HWH</small> does for my lord in accordance with all that he promised, the good things for you,
and he commissions you as <i>Nagid</i> over Israel:"
I Samuel 25:31,"then do not let this be for you an obstacle, or a stumbling-block of heart for my lord,
to shed blood for nothing,
for my lord to find deliverance by himself [alone]!
And when Y<small>HWH</small> does-good to my lord,
then call-to-mind your maidservant!"
I Samuel 25:32,"David said to Avigayil:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
who has sent you this day to meet me!"
I Samuel 25:33,"And blessed is your discernment, and blessed are you,
who has prevented me this day from coming into blood-guilt, delivering myself by my hand [alone]."
I Samuel 25:34,"For: by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, who has held me back from doing-evil to you—
indeed, had you not quickly come to meet me,
there would not have been left to Naval, by the light of daybreak, [even] one pissing against the wall!"
I Samuel 25:35,"David took from her hand what she had brought him,
and to her he said:
Go up in peace to your house;
see,
I have hearkened to your voice, and have lifted up your face!"
I Samuel 25:36,"Avigayil went back to Naval,
and here, he was having a drinkfest in his house, like a king’s drinkfest.
Now Naval’s heart was in good-humor upon him—he was drunk to excess—
so she did not tell him a thing, small or great, until the light of daybreak."
I Samuel 25:37,"But it was at daybreak,
when the wine was going out of Naval,
that his wife told those things to him,
and his heart died within him, and he himself became [like] a stone."
I Samuel 25:38,"It was about ten days [later]
that Y<small>HWH</small> attacked Naval, so that he died."
I Samuel 25:39,"David heard that Naval was dead,
and he said:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>,
who has upheld my cause at having been mocked at the hand of Naval,
and his servant he has held back from evildoing!
And as for the evildoing of Naval, Y<small>HWH</small> has returned it on his head.
David sent and spoke for Avigayil, to take her as a wife for him;"
I Samuel 25:40,"David’s servants came to Avigayil, to Carmel,
and spoke to her, saying:
David has sent us to you, to take you as a wife for him."
I Samuel 25:41,"She proceeded to bow down, nostrils to the ground,
and said:
Here, your maidservant is a handmaid to wash the feet of my lord’s servants!"
I Samuel 25:42,"Avigayil quickly arose and mounted a donkey, with five of her girls who went behind her;
she went after David’s messengers,
and she became a wife for him."
I Samuel 25:43,"Now Ahinoam [too] David had taken, from Yizre’el,
and the two of them alike became wives for him;"
I Samuel 25:44,"for Sha’ul had given Mikhal his daughter, David’s wife,
to Palti son of Layish, who was from Gallim."
I Samuel 26:1,"Some Zifites came to Sha’ul at Giv’a, saying:
Is not David hiding himself at the Hill of Hakhila, facing the wasteland?"
I Samuel 26:2,"So Sha’ul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Zif,
and with him were three thousand men, hand-picked ones of Israel,
to seek out David in the Wilderness of Zif."
I Samuel 26:3,"Sha’ul encamped at the Hill of Hakhila, which faces the wasteland, along the road,
while David was staying in the wilderness;
and he saw that Sha’ul had come after him into the wilderness,"
I Samuel 26:4,"so David sent spies, that he might know that Sha’ul had come for certain."
I Samuel 26:5,"Then David arose and came to the place where Sha’ul was encamped;
David saw the place where Sha’ul was lying, along with Avner son of Ner, the commander of his forces,
with Sha’ul lying in the wagon-ring, and all the fighting-people encamped around him."
I Samuel 26:6,"And David spoke up, he said to Ahimelekh the Hittite and to Avishai son of Tzeruya, Yoav’s brother, saying:
Who will go down with me to Sha’ul, to the camp?
Avishai said:
I will go down with you!"
I Samuel 26:7,"So David and Avishai went to the fighting-people at nighttime,
and here, Sha’ul was lying asleep in the wagon-ring,
with his spear stuck into the ground at his head
and Avner and the fighting-people lying around him."
I Samuel 26:8,"Avishai said to David:
God has turned over your enemy today into your hand!
So-now, just let me strike him with the spear into the ground one time;
I will not [have to do it] twice to him!"
I Samuel 26:9,"But David said to Avishai:
You are not to bring him to ruin!
For who could stretch out his hand against Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one and be cleared?"
I Samuel 26:10,"And David said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
rather, Y<small>HWH</small> will attack him:
either his day will come, and he will die,
or into battle he will go down and be swept away!"
I Samuel 26:11,"[Heaven] forbid for me, by Y<small>HWH</small>,
from stretching out my hand against Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one!
So-now,
just take the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water,
and let us go on our [way]."
I Samuel 26:12,"So David took the spear and the cruse of water at Sha’ul’s head, and they went on their [way];
no one saw, no one knew, and no one awoke,
for all of them were sleeping,
for a deep-slumber of Y<small>HWH</small> had fallen upon them."
I Samuel 26:13,"Then David crossed over the side-across
and stopped at the summit of the hill, afar off,
—great was the space between them—"
I Samuel 26:14,"and David called out to the fighting-people and to Avner son of Ner, saying:
Won’t you answer, Avner?
Avner answered and said:
Who are you, [that] you call to the king?"
I Samuel 26:15,"David said to Avner:
Aren’t you a man?
And who is like you in Israel?
So why haven’t you kept watch over your lord king?
For one of the fighting-people came to bring ruin to the king your lord!"
I Samuel 26:16,"No good is this thing that you have done!
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
indeed, you are sons of death,
[seeing] that you did not keep watch over your lord, over Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed!
For-now, see:
where are the king’s spear and the cruse of water that were at his head?"
I Samuel 26:17,"Sha’ul recognized David’s voice;
he said:
Is that your voice, my son David?
David said:
It is my voice, my lord king!"
I Samuel 26:18,"And he said:
Why now does my lord pursue after his servant?
Indeed, what have I done?
And what evil is there in my hand?"
I Samuel 26:19,"So-now,
pray let my lord king hearken to the words of his servant:
if it is Y<small>HWH</small> [who] incited you against me, let him savor a gift- offering;
but if it was by humans,
then let them be doomed before Y<small>HWH</small>,
for they have driven me away today from being attached to Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance,
saying:
Go, serve other gods!"
I Samuel 26:20,"So-now,
let not my blood fall to the earth, away from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>!
For the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea,
as one pursues a partridge in the hills!"
I Samuel 26:21,"Sha’ul said:
I have sinned; return, my son David!
For I will do evil to you no more,
since my life was precious in your eyes this day.
Here, I have acted-foolishly and have been in exceedingly great error!"
I Samuel 26:22,"David answered and said:
Here is the king’s spear;
let one of the serving-lads cross over and fetch it,"
I Samuel 26:23,"and may Y<small>HWH</small> return upon each one his righteousness and his trustworthiness,
[seeing] that Y<small>HWH</small> gave you into my hand
but I would not stretch out my hand against Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed."
I Samuel 26:24,"Here, as your life has been deemed-great this day in my eyes,
so may my life grow-great in Y<small>HWH</small>’s eyes,
and may he rescue me from every distress!"
I Samuel 26:25,"Sha’ul said to David:
Blessed are you, my son David;
you will do, yes, do [well],
and you will prevail, yes, prevail!
David went on his way, and Sha’ul returned to his place."
I Samuel 27:1,"David said in his heart:
Now
I will be swept away one day by the hand of Sha’ul;
there is nothing better for me than that I should escape, yes, escape to the land of the Philistines—
then Sha’ul will despair of me, of seeking me again throughout all the territory of Israel,
and I will escape from his hand."
I Samuel 27:2,"So David arose and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Akhish son of Maokh, king of Gat."
I Samuel 27:3,"And David stayed with Akhish in Gat, he and his men, each one and his household,
and David and his two wives,
Ahinoam, the Yizre’elite, and Avigayil wife of Naval, the Carmelite."
I Samuel 27:4,"It was told to Sha’ul that David had gotten away to Gat,
and he did not continue to seek him anymore."
I Samuel 27:5,"David said to Akhish:
Now if I have found favor in your eyes,
let there be given to me a place in one of the country towns, and let me settle there;
why should your servant settle in the royal city with you?"
I Samuel 27:6,"So Akhish gave him Tziklag on that day;
therefore Tziklag came-to-belong to the kings of Judah, until this day."
I Samuel 27:7,Now the number of days that David stayed in Philistine country was a year and four months.
I Samuel 27:8,"And David would go up, along with his men;
they would sweep down on the Geshurites, the Gizrites, and the Amalekites
—for they were the settled-folk of the land who were [there] from ages [past]—
as you come to Shur, as far as the land of Egypt."
I Samuel 27:9,"And David would strike the land;
he would leave alive no man or woman,
but he would take sheep and oxen, donkeys and camels and garments,
and then he would return and come back to Akhish."
I Samuel 27:10,"And Akhish would say:
On [whom] did you sweep down today?
And David would say:
Against the Negev of Judah,
or: against the Negev of the Yerahme’elites,
or: against the Negev of the Kenites."
I Samuel 27:11,"But no man or woman would David leave alive to bring to Gat, saying:
Lest they report concerning us, saying:
Thus did David do
and thus was his practice,
all the days that he stayed in Philistine country."
I Samuel 27:12,"So Akhish came-to-trust David, saying:
He has made himself reek, yes, reek so to his own people, to Israel,
so he will be servant to me for a lifetime!"
I Samuel 28:1,"It was in those days
that the Philistines gathered their camps into an armed-force, to wage battle against Israel.
Akhish said to David:
You know, yes, know that you must go out with me in the camp, you and your men."
I Samuel 28:2,"David said to Akhish:
Then you yourself will know what your servant can do!
So Akhish said to David:
Then I will make you my chief bodyguard for all the days [to come]!"
I Samuel 28:3,"Now Shemuel had died,
and all Israel had beaten [the breast] for him and had buried him in Rama, in his town.
Now Sha’ul had removed [those inquiring of] ghosts and all- knowing ones from the land."
I Samuel 28:4,"And the Philistines gathered and came, encamping at Shunem,
while Sha’ul gathered all Israel, encamping at Gilboa."
I Samuel 28:5,"Sha’ul saw the Philistines’ camp
and he became afraid, and his heart trembled exceedingly."
I Samuel 28:6,"So Sha’ul made request of Y<small>HWH</small>,
but Y<small>HWH</small> did not answer him,
either through dreams, or through <i>Urim,</i> or through prophets."
I Samuel 28:7,"So Sha’ul said to his servants:
Seek for me a woman, a possessor of ghosts,
that I may go to her, that I may inquire of [the dead] through her.
His servants said to him:
There is a woman, a possessor of ghosts at En Dor."
I Samuel 28:8,"Sha’ul disguised himself and clothed himself in other garments,
and he went, he and two men with him,
and came to the woman at night.
He said:
Now divine for me by a ghost;
bring up for me the one whom I will designate to you."
I Samuel 28:9,"The woman said to him:
Here, <i>you</i> know what Sha’ul has done,
how he has cut off [those inquiring of] ghosts and all-knowing ones from the land.
So why would you ensnare my life, to cause my death?"
I Samuel 28:10,"Sha’ul swore to her by Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, should any guilt befall you through this matter … !"
I Samuel 28:11,"The woman said:
Whom shall I bring up for you?
He said:
Bring up Shemuel for me."
I Samuel 28:12,"The woman saw Shemuel,
and she cried out in a loud voice;
the woman said to Sha’ul, saying:
Why have you deceived me? For you are Sha’ul!"
I Samuel 28:13,"The king said to her:
Do not be afraid;
rather, what do you see?
The woman said to Sha’ul:
I see a godlike-being coming up from the ground."
I Samuel 28:14,"He said to her:
What is its form?
She said:
An old man is coming up,
and he is wrapped in a cloak.
Then Sha’ul knew that it was Shemuel,
and he prostrated himself, nostrils to the earth, and bowed low."
I Samuel 28:15,"Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
Why have you disturbed me, by bringing me up?
Sha’ul said:
I am exceedingly distressed—
the Philistines are waging battle against me
and God has turned away from me:
he no longer answers me,
either through the hand of the prophets or through dreams.
So I have called you to make known to me what I should do!"
I Samuel 28:16,"Shemuel said:
But why do you make request of me?
For Y<small>HWH</small> has turned away from you and has become your foe!"
I Samuel 28:17,"Y<small>HWH</small> has done to you as he promised through my hand:
Y<small>HWH</small> has torn away the kingdom from your hand
and has given it to your fellow, to David"
I Samuel 28:18,"—as you did not hearken to Y<small>HWH</small>’s voice,
and did not carry out his blazing anger against Amalek.
Therefore this thing has Y<small>HWH</small> done to you this day!"
I Samuel 28:19,"And Y<small>HWH</small> will also give Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines;
tomorrow, you and your sons are with me;
also the camp of Israel Y<small>HWH</small> will give into the hand of the Philistines!"
I Samuel 28:20,"Sha’ul quickly fell his full stature to the ground;
he was exceedingly afraid at Shemuel’s words,
also there was no strength in him,
for he had not eaten food all day and all night."
I Samuel 28:21,"The woman came to Sha’ul,
and she saw that he was exceedingly terrified,
so she said to him:
Here, your handmaid hearkened to your voice,
and I put my life in my hand—
I hearkened to your words which you spoke to me."
I Samuel 28:22,"So-then,
now hearken, you also, to your handmaid’s voice:
I will put before you a bit of bread—eat,
so that there may be strength in you when you go on your way."
I Samuel 28:23,"He refused, and said: I will not eat!
But his servants pressed him, and also the woman,
so he hearkened to their voice;
he arose from the ground and sat down on the couch."
I Samuel 28:24,"Now the woman had a stall-fed calf in the house;
she hurried and slew it,
took meal and kneaded it, and baked it into unleavened-cakes."
I Samuel 28:25,"Then she brought it close before Sha’ul and before his servants, and they ate,
and they arose and went away, that [very] night."
I Samuel 29:1,"The Philistines gathered all their encampments at Afek,
while Israel was encamped at the spring that is in Yizre’el."
I Samuel 29:2,"Now the Philistine overlords were crossing over by [divisions of] hundreds and by [divisions of] thousands,
with David and his men crossing over in the rear, beside Akhish."
I Samuel 29:3,"The Philistine commanders said:
What [about] these Hebrews?
Akhish said to the Philistine commanders:
Is this not David, servant of Sha’ul king of Israel,
who has been with me for these days and these years,
yet I have found nothing [amiss] in him, from the day of his falling in [with us] until this day?"
I Samuel 29:4,"The Philistine commanders became furious with him,
and the Philistine commanders said to him:
Return the man, and let him return to his place which you assigned him,
but do not let him go down with us into battle,
so that he will not be an adversary to us in battle!
For whereby will this one make himself acceptable [again] to his lord—
is it not with the heads of those men?"
I Samuel 29:5,"Is this not David,
about whom they chanted with dancing, saying: Sha’ul has struck down his thousands, but David—his myriads?"
I Samuel 29:6,"So Akhish had David called
and said to him:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
indeed, you are upright,
and good in my eyes is your going out and your coming in with me in the camp,
for I have not found any evil in you from the day of your coming to me until this day—
but in the eyes of the Philistine overlords you are not good!"
I Samuel 29:7,"So-now,
turn back, and go in peace,
so that you do not do evil in the eyes of the Philistine overlords."
I Samuel 29:8,"David said to Akhish:
Indeed, what have I done;
what have you found in your servant
from the day that I was [first] before you, until this day,
that I may not come and wage battle against the enemies of my lord king?"
I Samuel 29:9,"Akhish answered and said to David:
I acknowledge that you are as good in my eyes as a messenger of a god;
however, the Philistine commanders say:
He must not go up with us into battle!"
I Samuel 29:10,"So-now, start-early at daybreak,
and as for your lord’s servants who came with you,
you are [all] to start-early at daybreak;
when it is light for you, go!"
I Samuel 29:11,"So David started-early, he and his men, to go at daybreak, to return to the land of the Philistines,
while the Philistines went up to Yizre’el."
I Samuel 30:1,"It was, when David came and his men to Tziklag, on the third day
—now Amalekites had swept down on the Negev, on Tziklag;
they had struck Tziklag, and burned it with fire,"
I Samuel 30:2,"and they had taken captive the women that were in it, from young to old.
They had not put any [of them] to death,
but had led them away and gone on their way—"
I Samuel 30:3,"David and his men came to the town,
and here, it was burned down with fire,
with their wives and their sons and their daughters taken captive!"
I Samuel 30:4,"And David and the fighting-people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept
until there was no strength in them to weep."
I Samuel 30:5,"Now David’s two wives had been taken captive,
Ahinoam the Yizre’elite and Avigayil wife of Naval the Carmelite."
I Samuel 30:6,"And David was exceedingly distressed,
for the people intended to stone him,
for bitter were all the people’s feelings,
each one over his sons and over his daughters—
but David found strength in Y<small>HWH</small> his God."
I Samuel 30:7,"David said to Evyatar the priest, son of Ahimelekh:
Now bring the <i>efod</i> close to me!
Evyatar brought the <i>efod</i> close to David."
I Samuel 30:8,"And David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Shall I pursue after this raiding-band?
Will I overtake them?
He said to him:
Pursue,
for you will overtake, yes, overtake, and will rescue, yes, rescue [them]!"
I Samuel 30:9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him,
and they came to Wadi Besor, while those left stayed behind."
I Samuel 30:10,"And David gave pursuit, he and four hundred men,
while two hundred men stayed behind, who were [too] exhausted to cross Wadi Besor."
I Samuel 30:11,"They found an Egyptian man in the open-field, and took him to David;
they gave him bread and he ate, and they had him drink water,"
I Samuel 30:12,"and they gave him a slice of pressed-figs and two raisin-bunches, and he ate.
Then his spirit returned to him
—for he had not eaten bread and had not drunk water for three days and three nights."
I Samuel 30:13,"And David said to him:
To whom do you [belong]? And where are you from?
He said:
I am an Egyptian serving-lad, the servant of an Amalekite man;
my lord abandoned me, since I became sick three days ago."
I Samuel 30:14,"We were sweeping down on the Negev of the Kereitites,
against what belongs to Judah,
and against the Negev of Calev,
and Tziklag we burned with fire."
I Samuel 30:15,"David said to him:
Will you bring me down to this band?
He said:
Swear to me by God
if you should put me to death, if you should turn me over to the hand of my [former] lord … !
Then I will bring you down to this band."
I Samuel 30:16,"He brought him down,
and here, they were stretched out all over the surface of the ground,
eating and drinking and celebrating
among all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah."
I Samuel 30:17,"And David struck them from the [dawn] breeze until the morrow’s sunset;
not one of them escaped except for four hundred serving-lads who mounted camels and fled."
I Samuel 30:18,"So David rescued everything that Amalek had taken,
and his two wives David rescued [as well];"
I Samuel 30:19,"nothing was missing of theirs, from small to great, to sons and daughters,
or from the spoils to anything that they took for themselves—
everything David restored."
I Samuel 30:20,"David took all the flocks and all the herds;
they drove them before that livestock and said:
These are David’s spoils!"
I Samuel 30:21,"And David came back to the two hundred men that had been too exhausted to go after David
—they had had them stay at Wadi Besor—
and they went out to meet David and to meet the fighting-people who were with him.
And David came close to the people, and he inquired of them for peace,"
I Samuel 30:22,"but every evil and base man of the men who had gone with David spoke up
and said:
Because they did not go with me,
we will not give them any of the spoils that we rescued
except to each one his wife and his children;
let them drive [these] away and go!"
I Samuel 30:23,"David said:
You must not do thus, my brothers,
with what Y<small>HWH</small> has given us!
—he watched over us and gave the band that came against us, into our hand."
I Samuel 30:24,"For who would hearken to you in this matter?
Indeed, like the share of the one who goes down into battle is the share of the one who stays by the gear:
together they shall divide-shares."
I Samuel 30:25,"So it was from that day and forward
that they made it a prescribed-law and a rule in Israel,
until this day."
I Samuel 30:26,"David came back to Tziklag, and he sent off [some] of the spoils to the elders of Judah, to his fellows, saying:
Here, it is a blessing-gift for you, from the spoil of Y<small>HWH</small>’s enemies:"
I Samuel 30:27,"for those in Bet-El, for those in Ramot-Negev, for those in Yattir,"
I Samuel 30:28,"for those in Aro’er, for those in Sifmot, for those in Eshtemoa,"
I Samuel 30:29,"for those in Rakhal, for those in the Yerahme’elite towns, for those in the Kenite towns,"
I Samuel 30:30,"for those in Horma, for those in Bekhor-Ashan, for those in Atakh,"
I Samuel 30:31,"for those in Hevron,
and for all the places that David went around in, he and his men."
I Samuel 31:1,"Now the Philistines were waging battle against Israel,
and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines;
the slain fell on Mount Gilboa."
I Samuel 31:2,"And the Philistines caught up with Sha’ul and with his sons,
and the Philistines struck down Yehonatan and Avinadav and Malki-Shua, Sha’ul’s sons."
I Samuel 31:3,"The battle was heavy around Sha’ul;
the shooters, the men of the bow, found him,
and he was seriously wounded by the shooters."
I Samuel 31:4,"So Sha’ul said to his weapons bearer:
Draw your sword and run me through with it,
lest these Foreskinned Ones come and run me through and deal wantonly with me!
But the weapons bearer would not, because he was exceedingly afraid,
so Sha’ul took the sword and fell on it."
I Samuel 31:5,"And his weapons bearer saw that Sha’ul was dead,
so he too fell on his sword, and died with him."
I Samuel 31:6,"Thus died Sha’ul, and his three sons and his weapons bearer,
indeed, all his men, on that day, together."
I Samuel 31:7,"The men of Israel saw, those across the Valley and those across the Jordan,
that the [other] men of Israel had fled,
and that Sha’ul and his sons had died,
so they abandoned the towns and fled,
and Philistines came and settled in them."
I Samuel 31:8,"Now it was on the morrow,
that the Philistines came to strip the slain,
and they found Sha’ul and his three sons, fallen on Mount Gilboa."
I Samuel 31:9,"They cut off his head and stripped off his armor,
and sent [word] throughout the land of the Philistines, all around,
to bring-the-news into the house of their carved-idols and among the people."
I Samuel 31:10,"They placed his armor in the Temple-House of Ashtarot,
and his corpse they thrust into the wall of Bet-She’an."
I Samuel 31:11,"But the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad heard
about what the Philistines had done to Sha’ul,"
I Samuel 31:12,"so all the men of valor arose and went all night
and took down Sha’ul’s corpse and the corpses of his sons from the wall of Bet-Shan,
and brought them to Yavesh, and burned them there;"
I Samuel 31:13,"then they took their bones and buried them beneath the tamarisk in Yavesh,
and fasted for seven days."
