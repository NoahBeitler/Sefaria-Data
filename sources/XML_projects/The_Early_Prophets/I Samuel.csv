I Samuel 1:1,"Now there was a man from Ramatayim in Tzofim, from the highlands of Efrayim;
his name was Elkana son of Yeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Tzuf, an Efrayimite."
I Samuel 1:2,"He had two wives:
the name of one was Hanna/Grace, while the name of the second was Peninna/Pearl;
now Peninna had children, but Hanna had no children."
I Samuel 1:3,"And that man used to go up from his town, from year to year,
to bow down and to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, at Shilo
—Eli’s two sons, Hofni and Pin’has, priests to Y<small>HWH</small>, were there."
I Samuel 1:4,"Now it was, one day,
that Elkana was sacrificing,
—he would give to Peninna his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, portions,"
I Samuel 1:5,"but to Hanna he would give a double portion,
for [it was] Hanna he loved,
although Y<small>HWH</small> had closed up her womb."
I Samuel 1:6,"And her rival-wife would provoke her with provocation, for the sake of making-her-complain,
for Y<small>HWH</small> had closed up her womb;"
I Samuel 1:7,"and thus he would do, year after year:
whenever she would go up to the House of God, thus would she provoke her—
… and she wept and would not eat,"
I Samuel 1:8,"so Elkana her husband said to her:
Hanna, why are you weeping?
Why don’t you eat?
And why is your heart in such ill-humor?
Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
I Samuel 1:9,"Hanna arose after eating at Shilo, and after drinking
—now Eli the priest was sitting on a throne by the doorpost of the great-hall of Y<small>HWH</small>—"
I Samuel 1:10,"and she was bitter of feelings,
so she prayed to Y<small>HWH</small>, while she wept, yes, wept;"
I Samuel 1:11,"she vowed a vow, and said:
O Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High,
if you will see, yes, see the affliction of your maidservant,
and will bear me in mind and not forget your maidservant,
and will give your maidservant seed of men,
then I will give him to Y<small>HWH</small> all the days of his life:
no razor shall go up on his head!"
I Samuel 1:12,"Now it was, as she multiplied her praying in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
that Eli was watching her mouth:"
I Samuel 1:13,"now Hanna, she was speaking in her heart,
only her lips were moving, but her voice could not be heard—
so Eli took her for a drunkard.

I Samuel 2:1,"<b>Ramatayim:</b> Possibly Rama (“Height”), a location frequently associated with Shemuel in the text; it was north of Jerusalem, near the border of what became Israel, the Northern Kingdom. <b>Tzofim:</b> “Watchmen,” but McCarter (980), following Driver, judges the text corrupt here, and posits “a Tzufite,” after Elkana’s ancestor later in the verse, <b>the highlands of Efrayim:</b> The geographical backbone of what became the Northern Kingdom. <b>Elkana:</b> The name means “God Acquires/Creates.” His son Shemuel will not grow up with his parents, perhaps hinted at here."
I Samuel 2:2,<b>Hanna:</b> Pronounced <i>hahn-NAH;</i> trad. English “Hannah.” <b>Peninna:</b> Pronounced <i>pe-nin-NAH;</i> trad. English “Peninnah.”
I Samuel 2:3,"<b>from year to year</b> (see also v.7, “year after year”): This phrase had occurred in the last chapter of Judges; such links between adjacent texts occur from time to time in the Bible, <b>bow down:</b> This posture of worship, also used in approaching a superior, is on the knees, usually with “nostrils to the earth.” Y<small>HWH</small>: As explained above in “On Using This Book,” the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, whose pronunciation is not precisely known, is traditionally transcribed as “the Lord” and the like. Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it (for example, “The Eternal” or <i>“Ado-nai</i>”). Y<small>HWH</small> <b>of the Forces-On-High:</b> In <i>The Early Prophets</i> this title has a military ring; <i>tzeva’ot</i> may also refer to the concept of a heavenly council of gods from earlier mythological traditions. <b>Shilo:</b> Pronounced <i>shee-LO;</i> trad. English “Shiloh,” one of the important pre-Jerusalem shrines, situated in the highlands of Efrayim. <b>Hofni … Pin’has:</b> Pronounced <i>hof-NEE</i> and <i>pin-HASS.</i> Like a number of early Israelite priestly names, these are Egyptian in origin. Pin’has is trad. English “Phineas” and means “dark-skinned.”"
I Samuel 2:4,"<b>… and she wept … :</b> The narrative picks up from v.4, on a day that Elkana was offering sacrifices; everything in between is the background to Hanna’s weeping."
I Samuel 2:5,"<b>better … than ten sons:</b> As Alter (1999) points out, Elkana’s question is both empathetic and off the mark; how could he understand a barren mother’s feelings?"
I Samuel 2:6,"<b>Eli:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-LEE.</i> <b>throne:</b> Unlike in modern usage, Heb. <i>kissei</i> tends to mean more than a simple “chair” in the Bible. <b>great-hall:</b> Used here to denote the sanctuary."
I Samuel 2:7,"<b>see:</b> The preposition used with the Hebrew verb adds an element of feeling, connoting “look sympathetically.” <b>your maidservant:</b> Referring to oneself in the third person is used in the Bible when one addresses a superior. <b>I will give him to Y<small>HWH</small> … no razor:</b> Hanna here alludes to the Nazirite laws of Num. 6, where in fulfillment of a religious vow, a person would not shave (there are additional provisions and prohibitions). Shemuel, like Shimshon (Judg. 13–16) before him, appears to be Nazirite for life, a concept not found in the Numbers text."
I Samuel 2:8,<b>in the presence of</b> Y<small>HWH</small>: This phrase usually indicates a sacred location or building.
I Samuel 2:9,"<b>took her for a drunkard:</b> Praying, as well as reading and writing, was not a silent activity in the ancient world, hence Eli’s mistaken assessment of Hanna.
The Song of Hanna; Eli and His Sons: Hanna’s prayer occurs earlier in Samuel than any other poem in a biblical narrative book. As mentioned above, it introduces the idea that God may reverse the expected course of events. It thus carries the repetition of an oft-rehearsed biblical theme which undoubtedly points to the people of Israel itself, in its status as a latecomer and a frequently subordinate group in the ancient Near East.
Not surprisingly, the poem is shot through with vocabulary reflecting both ends of the social spectrum. “Mighty … sated … rich … noble … might” alternate with “those who stumble … those once hungry … the barren one … the needy … the destitute,” and the like. The line “The barren one has given birth to seven” (v.5) is perhaps the immediate reason for its having been chosen for the mouth of the previously childless Hanna; such verbal connections between texts, which often hinge on a single word or phrase, are fairly typical in ancient literature. But above all, it is the triumphant ending on a monarchical note, with the exalting of God’s “anointed,” that not so subtly indicates what we are reading: a book about the choosing of a king.
When the narrative resumes, even before we learn anything about Shemuel as Eli’s successor, the text makes sure that we are aware of the state of deterioration into which the worship of Y<small>HWH</small> has fallen. As a prelude to the actions of Eli’s sons, we are told at some length how even the servants of the priests make a mockery of the sacrifices in their zeal to extract the priests’ due. Only in v.22 do we learn of the exact nature of the sons’ sin, the serious act of sleeping with the serving-women at the very entrance to the shrine. Despite Eli’s entreaties, his sons ignore him because Y<small>HWH</small> has other plans.
The long condemnation of Eli by Y<small>HWH</small> through an anonymous “man of God” that ends the chapter in vv.27–36 leaves no doubt about the fate of the priest and his descendants. It mirrors what will happen to Sha’ul, Israel’s first king, later in the book."
I Samuel 2:10,"Eli said to her:
How long will you be drunk?
Put away your wine from you!"
I Samuel 2:11,"But Hanna answered and said:
No, my lord,
a woman hardened of spirit am I.
Wine and beer I have not drunk,
but I have been pouring out my soul in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Samuel 2:12,"Do not consider your maidservant a base woman,
for it is out of my great anxiety and my being provoked [that] I have spoken until now."
I Samuel 2:13,"Eli answered and said: Go in peace,
and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have requested of him."
I Samuel 2:14,"She said:
May your handmaid find favor in your eyes.
The woman went on her way, and she ate,
and her face was no longer [sad] on her."
I Samuel 2:15,"They started-early in the morning:
they bowed down in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
then they returned, and came back to their house in Rama.
And Elkana knew Hanna his wife,
and Y<small>HWH</small> kept her in mind."
I Samuel 2:16,"So it was, at the turning of days,
that Hanna conceived and gave birth to a son;
she called his name: Shemuel/The One From God,
meaning: from Y<small>HWH</small> I requested him."
I Samuel 2:17,"And the man Elkana went up, along with all his household,
to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> the yearly sacrifice, and his vow-offering,"
I Samuel 2:18,"but Hanna did not go up,
for she said to her husband:
… until the lad is weaned—
then I will bring him,
that he may be seen in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
he is to stay there forever."
I Samuel 2:19,"Elkana her husband said to her:
Do whatever is good in your eyes:
stay until you have weaned him—
only: may Y<small>HWH</small> fulfill his word!
So the woman stayed behind and nursed her son, until she had weaned him."
I Samuel 2:20,"She brought him up with her, when she had weaned him,
with a three-year-old bull and an <i>efa</i> of flour, and a skin of wine,
and brought him to the House of Y<small>HWH</small> at Shilo,
though the lad was [just] a lad."
I Samuel 2:21,"They slaughtered the bull,
and then they brought the lad to Eli."
I Samuel 2:22,"She said:
Please, my lord, as you yourself live, my lord:
I am the woman who was standing beside you here, to pray to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 2:23,"It was for this lad that I prayed,
and Y<small>HWH</small> has granted my request that I requested of him!"
I Samuel 2:24,"So I now lend-him-on-request to Y<small>HWH</small>;
all the days that he lives he is lent-on-request/<i>sha’ul</i> to Y<small>HWH</small>.
And they bowed down there to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 3:1,"And Hanna prayed, she said:
My heart swells because of Y<small>HWH</small>,
my horn is raised because of Y<small>HWH</small>;
my mouth is wide-with-boasting over my enemies,
for I rejoice in your deliverance!"
I Samuel 3:2,"There is no one holy like Y<small>HWH</small>,
indeed, no one beside you,
there is no rock like our God!"
I Samuel 3:3,"Do not speak so high, so high [and mighty],
letting your mouth run free,
for a god all-knowing is Y<small>HWH</small>,
by him are actions measured."
I Samuel 3:4,"The bow of the mighty is shattered,
but the stumblers are girded with strength."
I Samuel 3:5,"Those once-sated must hire themselves out for bread,
but those once-hungry will endure forever.
The barren one has given birth to seven,
while the one [with] many sons is dried up."
I Samuel 3:6,"Y<small>HWH</small> brings-death and bestows-life,
brings down to Sheol and brings up."
I Samuel 3:7,"Y<small>HWH</small> makes-poor and makes-rich,
brings low and, yes, lifts up."
I Samuel 3:8,"He raises the needy from the dust,
lifts the destitute from the dunghill,
to seat them with the noble ones,
and a throne of glory he has them inherit.
For Y<small>HWH</small>’s are the molten-pillars of the earth,
he has set the world upon them."
I Samuel 3:9,"The feet of his loyal ones he guards,
but the wicked moan in darkness—
for not by might does a man prevail."
I Samuel 3:10,"Y<small>HWH</small> shatters those opposing him,
from the heavens he thunders against them.
Y<small>HWH</small> judges to the limits of the earth;
may he give power to his king,
and lift up the horn of his anointed one!"
I Samuel 3:11,"And Elkana went to Rama, to his house,
while the lad began to attend Y<small>HWH</small>, in the presence of Eli the priest."
I Samuel 3:12,"Now the sons of Eli were base fellows;
they did not know Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 3:13,"And the norm of the priests with the people [was]:
whoever sacrificed a sacrifice,
the priest’s serving-lad would come while the flesh was boiling
with a fork of three teeth in his hand"
I Samuel 3:14,"and would strike at the pot or the kettle or the cauldron or the boiling-vat;
everything the fork would bring up, the priest would take for himself.
Thus they would do to all Israel who were coming there, at Shilo."
I Samuel 3:15,"Even before they would turn the fat into smoke,
the serving-lad of the priest would come and say to the person sacrificing:
Give over some flesh for roasting, for the priest,
for he will not take boiled flesh from you—only raw!"
I Samuel 3:16,"And if the person said to him:
Let them first turn the fat into smoke, yes, smoke,
then take for yourself whatever your appetite craves—
he would say to him:
No, but give it over right-now;
if not, I’ll take it by force!"
I Samuel 3:17,"Now the sin of the serving-lads was exceedingly great in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
for the men scorned the gift [intended] for Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 3:18,"Shemuel was attending in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
as a lad girded with a linen <i>efod.</i>"
I Samuel 3:19,"Now a small cloak his mother used to make him
and used to bring it up from year to year, when she went up with her husband to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice."
I Samuel 3:20,"And Eli would bless Elkana and his wife;
he would say:
May Y<small>HWH</small> give you seed from this woman
in place of the requested-one who was lent-on-request to Y<small>HWH</small>!
Then they would go back to their place."
I Samuel 3:21,"Indeed, Y<small>HWH</small> took account of Hanna,
and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters;
but the lad Shemuel grew up in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 3:22,"Now when Eli became exceedingly old,
he heard about all that his sons were doing to all Israel:
how they were lying with the women who were acting-as-a- workforce at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment."
I Samuel 3:23,"He said to them:
Why do you act in accordance with these words that I hear—
evil accounts of you from all of these people?"
I Samuel 3:24,"Don’t, my sons!
Indeed, it is no good, the report that I hear Y<small>HWH</small>’s people spreading."
I Samuel 3:25,"If a man sins against [another] man, God will mediate for him,
but if it is against Y<small>HWH</small> [that] a man sins, who will intercede for him?
Yet they did not hearken to their father’s voice,
for Y<small>HWH</small> desired to have them die."
I Samuel 3:26,"But the lad Shemuel went on growing greater and more pleasing,
so with Y<small>HWH</small>, so with men.

I Samuel 3:27,"<b>pouring out my soul:</b> An extremely strong expression; usually in the Bible, the objects of pouring are blood or anger. Here it is also a nice play on imagery, since Hanna has just rightly denied that she has been drinking.

I Samuel 4:7,<b>king:</b> An anachronism which nicely foreshadows the major concern of the book. <b>anointed one:</b> A synonym for “king”; the verb refers to the practice of consecrating a ruler by pouring oil on his head.
I Samuel 4:8,"<b>base fellows:</b> It is difficult to find an appropriate modern English translation for the phrase; “ne’er-do-wells,” “lowlifes,” or “scoundrels” are older equivalents.

I Samuel 4:17,"Y<small>HWH</small> <b>desired to have them die:</b> Here, as elsewhere, the book is moving toward the establishment of the monarchy, so Eli’s sons have to be removed from the picture.
The Philistines and the Coffer: As if to stress that the Philistines’ victory in the previous chapter was the doing of God and not strictly the result of their own military prowess, the text follows the Coffer to the Philistine town of Ashdod, where it becomes clear that possessing it brings danger. In passages that express the Bible’s usual contempt for pagan culture, the very statue of the Philistine god Dagon is mysteriously destroyed by the Coffer’s presence, and the inhabitants, first, of Ashdod, and then of Gat, are stricken with hemorrhoids to the point that their “cry-for-help went up to the heavens” (v.12). Clearly, the Coffer will have to be returned to Israel.

I Samuel 4:18,"She said:
Exiled is the glory from Israel,

I Samuel 5:1,"Now when the Philistines took the Coffer of God,
they brought it from Even Ha-Ezer to Ashdod."
I Samuel 5:2,"Then the Philistines took the Coffer of God
and brought it to the House of Dagon,
and set it next to Dagon."
I Samuel 5:3,"The Ashdodites started-early on the morrow,
but here was Dagon, fallen down on his face to the ground before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>!
So they took Dagon and returned him to his place."
I Samuel 5:4,"They started-early at daybreak, on the morrow,
but here was Dagon, fallen down on his face to the ground before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>,
with Dagon’s head and the two palms of his hands cut off, on the threshold;
only Dagon[’s torso] remained on him."
I Samuel 5:5,"—Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who enter the House of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod,
until this day."
I Samuel 5:6,"And the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was heavy against the Ashdodites, and he devastated them;
he struck them with tumors,

I Samuel 6:1,"<b>Ashdod:</b> One of the five chief Philistines cities, the others being Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and Gat. All are on or near the Mediterranean coast."
I Samuel 6:2,"<b>Dagon:</b> Pronounced <i>dah-GOHN,</i> a long-revered fertility god of the ancient Near East, here connected with the Philistines. While no material evidence of his worship among them has been found, the Philistines are known to have adapted quickly to local cultures."
I Samuel 6:3,"<b>fallen down on his face:</b> In an obvious posture of submission, <b>head and … palms … cut off:</b> A known treatment of those defeated in war; see I Sam. 31:9–10, below, and the fate of the notorious Jezebel in II Kings 9:35."
I Samuel 6:4,"<b>Therefore the priests … :</b> Like many biblical stories, this one has an etiological function, attempting to explain an old custom or name."
I Samuel 6:5,"<b>devastated:</b> Some emend Heb. <i>sh-m-m</i> to <i>h-m-m,</i> “panicked,” a key word in Chaps. <b>4–5. tumors:</b> The written text has the nastier “hemorrhoids” (<i>tehorim</i>); scribal tradition has substituted the present “tumors” (<i>’ofalim</i>). These, and the mice-related plague (see :4), are viewed as a further divine curse on the Philistines for their possession of the Coffer. See Alter (1999) for a discussion of the long-standing confusion in the text; he cites an old interpretation that the passage actually refers to the bubonic plague.
“Give Us a King!” : It is a consistent pattern in world literature that when a great leader grows old, he either makes a long final public speech or deals with the appointment of a successor. Sometimes it is both. Like his mentor Eli, however, Shemuel is stymied in his desire for continuity in leadership by the fact that his own sons do not “walk in his ways” (vv.3 and 5). In addition to the sons’ corrupt behavior as judges, violating rules stated already in Exod. 23:8, the real need of the moment is for a strong military leader, as it was earlier in the book of Judges. So the Israelites request a king who will fight their wars (v.20) and thus enable them to be a self-respecting entity (vv.5 and 20, “like all the nations”).
Shemuel takes their plea as a personal rejection, but God has to remind him in v.7 that it is really a rejection of God himself as Israel’s only king. Up to this point in the narratives of the Bible, the concept of divine kingship had been implied, through wilderness wanderings, conquest, and settlement. Now it appears that this cannot continue, at least not without an earthly stand-in. But to make clear the writer’s opinion that monarchy must be controlled, Shemuel delivers a pointed warning to the people (vv.11–18). It unmistakably implies that kings are takers—that verb punctuates the speech four times—who will disrupt the time-honored practices of village life and spend their own time accumulating personal power and wealth. The ominous warning at the end of the speech, that God will not listen to the Israelites’ predictable outcry when they are oppressed by future kings, goes unheeded, as the people refuse (Heb. root <i>m-’-n</i>) to be swayed from their obsession with security, and in essence reject (<i>m-’-s</i>) God.
In many ways this chapter is a transitional one, and could either be grouped with the stories about Shemuel alone, as some scholars have done, or placed as the introduction to what follows, as here. It may be another example of the Bible’s tendency, at least in its final form, to display overlapping structures."
I Samuel 7:1,"Now it was, when Shemuel had grown old,
that he made his sons judges for Israel"
I Samuel 7:2,"—the name of his firstborn son was Yoel,
and the name of his second, Aviyya—
judges in Be’er-Sheva."
I Samuel 7:3,"But his sons did not walk in his ways:
they turned aside after profit,
and they took bribes and cast aside cases-for-justice."
I Samuel 7:4,"So all the elders of Israel gathered together
and came to Shemuel at Rama;"
I Samuel 7:5,"they said to him:
Here, you have grown old,
and your sons have not walked in your ways.
So-now,
make us a king to lead us, like all the nations!"
I Samuel 7:6,"The matter was evil in the eyes of Shemuel, when they said:
Give us a king to lead us!
So Shemuel prayed to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Samuel 7:7,"and Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to you;
for it is not you they have rejected,
rather, it is me they have rejected from being king over them,"
I Samuel 7:8,"just like all the deeds that they have done
from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day:
they have abandoned me
and served other gods!
Thus they are doing to you as well!"
I Samuel 7:9,"So-now, hearken to their voice.
However, you are to warn, yes, warn them;
you are to tell them the rule of the king who will reign as
king over them."
I Samuel 7:10,"And Shemuel related all the words of Y<small>HWH</small>
to the people who were requesting a king from him;"
I Samuel 7:11,"he said:
This will be the rule of the king who will reign as king over you:
your sons he will take away,
setting them in his chariotry and among his riders,
so that they run ahead of his chariotry,"
I Samuel 7:12,"to make them commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties,
to plow his plowing and harvest his harvest,
and to make his battle weapons and his chariot weapons;"
I Samuel 7:13,"your daughters he will take away
as ointment-mixers, as cooks, and as bakers;"
I Samuel 7:14,"your fields, your vineyards, and your olive-groves, the best ones, he will take away
and give to his servants;"
I Samuel 7:15,"your sowing-seed and your vine-fruit he will tithe
and give to his officers and to his servants;"
I Samuel 7:16,"your servants, your maids, your best young-men, and your donkeys, he will take away,
that they may do his work;"
I Samuel 7:17,"your flock he will tithe,
and you yourselves will be slaves for him."

Sha’ul the Victorious: Immediately after Sha’ul’s acclamation, his leadership is put to the test. A fierce Ammonite commander threatens an Israelite town lying to the north of his territory. While in our text his words seem ominous enough, the chapter as it appears in one of the Dead Sea Scroll manuscripts of Samuel—4QSa, probably an earlier and fuller version than MT—shows that he is a man of his word. The restored passage reads,
Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the Gadites and the Re’uvenites.
He would gouge out the right eye of each of them, and would not grant Israel a deliverer.
No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out.
But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Yavesh-Gil’ad.
In MT that has come down to us, apparently a scribe’s eye wandered from the original first “Yavesh-Gil’ad” to the second, skipping several sentences.
Upon hearing the news of the Ammonite danger, Sha’ul, in contrast to his weeping countrymen, is seized with the spirit of God and, in a reminder of the horrifying concubine story of Judg. 19–20, cuts up his oxen and sends their pieces around the country. The tribes rise up “as one man,” themselves gripped by a “terror of God” (an emotional state which elsewhere is usually viewed as a negative), and vanquish the brutal enemy.
Sha’ul is gracious in victory, refusing to kill those of his countrymen who had earlier doubted his abilities. In a passage that may come from an alternate source, his leadership is celebrated (“renewed”) at Gilgal as the chapter draws to a close. What began with a threat of mutilation ends with “joy” (v.15) over the strength of the newfound leader."
I Samuel 8:8,"But you, today: you have rejected your God,
the one delivering you from all your trials and your troubles!
You said to him:
No, rather, a king make over us!
So-now,
station yourselves in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, by your tribes, by your families."
I Samuel 8:9,"So Shemuel brought near each of the tribes of Israel,
and the tribe of Binyamin was captured-by-lot."
I Samuel 8:10,"Then he brought near the tribe of Binyamin by its clans,
and the Matrite clan was captured-by-lot;
then Sha’ul son of Kish was captured-by-lot.
But when they looked for him, he was not to be found."
I Samuel 8:11,"So they inquired further of Y<small>HWH</small>:
Has any other man come here?
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Here, he has hidden himself among the gear!"
I Samuel 8:12,"They ran and fetched him from there
and he stood amid the people,
and he was taller than all the people, from his shoulders and upward."
I Samuel 8:13,"Then Shemuel said to all the people:
Do you see whom Y<small>HWH</small> has chosen?
Indeed, there is none like him among all the people!
And all the people shouted;
they proclaimed: May the king live!"
I Samuel 8:14,"And Shemuel spoke to the people, the rule of kingship,
and wrote it in a record,

On <i>this</i> [condition] I will cut [a covenant] with you—
on [condition of] gouging out every one of your right eyes!
Thus will I make it a disgrace upon all Israel!"
I Samuel 9:3,"The elders of Yavesh said to him:
Leave us be for seven days;
we wish to send messengers throughout all the territory of Israel.
And if there is no deliverer for us,
we will go out [to surrender] to you."
I Samuel 9:4,"The messengers came to the Hill of Sha’ul
and spoke the words in the hearing of the people,
and all the people lifted up their voice and wept."
I Samuel 9:5,"Now here, when Sha’ul came after the cattle, from the open-field,
Sha’ul said:
What [ails] the people, that they are weeping?
They related to him the words of the men of Yavesh."
I Samuel 9:6,"And the rushing-spirit of God advanced upon Sha’ul when he heard these words,
and his anger flared up exceedingly;"
I Samuel 9:7,"he took a brace of cattle and chopped it up,
and he sent it off throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying:
Whoever does not go out [to war] after Sha’ul and after Shemuel,
thus shall be done to his cattle!
And a terror of Y<small>HWH</small> fell upon the people,
so that they went out as one man."
I Samuel 9:8,"He counted them [for war] at Bezek:
the Children of Israel totaled three hundred thousand,
while the men of Judah were thirty thousand."
I Samuel 9:9,"Then he said to the messengers who came:
Thus you are to say to the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad:
Tomorrow there will be victory for you, when the sun is hot!
The messengers came
and told it to the men of Yavesh,
and they rejoiced."
I Samuel 9:10,"And the men of Yavesh said:
Tomorrow we will go out to you,
and you may do with us whatever is good in your eyes."
I Samuel 9:11,"Now it was on the morrow
that Sha’ul put the fighting-people into three companies;
they entered the midst of the camp at the daybreak watch
and struck Ammon until the hot-part of the day.
And it was that those [who were] left—they were scattered,
so that there were not left among them two together."
I Samuel 9:12,"The people said to Shemuel:
Who was it that said: Shall Sha’ul be king over us?
Give over the men, that we may put them to death!"
I Samuel 9:13,"But Sha’ul said:

Shemuel’s Summation: In Chap. 8 we observed God, through Shemuel, expressing considerable reservations about the institution of kingship. Here, after the victory against the Ammonites, God reaffirms the monarchy, but in the broader context of Israelite history from Egypt to the present. After Shemuel establishes his own credibility by demonstrating that he, unlike future kings, has “taken” nothing from any Israelite, he launches into a long public oration which sounds rather like one of the farewell speeches we have come to expect at the end of biblical books (see the final chapters of both Deuteronomy and Joshua). The message is a simple one, thematically reminiscent of those earlier texts: if the Israelites will serve YHWH alone, forsaking the local gods, then all will be well; but if they “revolt,” both they and their king will be lost. The speech, despite its length, is able to remain on focus by sprinkling a specific vocabulary throughout. Four words occur in varying repetitions: “sin,” “evil,” and “request,” which denote Israel’s need for a king out of weakness, and “serve,” which comes to indicate their desired loyalty to YHWH. As in Chap. 8, the speech ends with a warning."
I Samuel 10:7,"Shemuel said to the people:
Come, let us go to Gilgal,

I Samuel 10:8,"So all the people went to Gilgal

Sha’ul Rejected I: The narrative has given us almost no time to savor Sha’ul’s victory in Chap. 11. It immediately provides an example of exactly what Shemuel had just warned against. In the midst of a back-and-forth struggle, with the Israelites attacking the Philistines in vv.2–4 and the Philistines retaliating from v.5 on, Sha’ul seeks to rally the troops again, with help anticipated from Shemuel. When the prophet is late in arriving, the king jumps the gun and offers the requisite sacrifices himself. He apparently is worried that he cannot win the battle without placating God, and he is additionally concerned about the bleeding away of the soldiers. When Shemuel finally shows up, his response to Sha’ul’s behavior is to in essence fire the king and indicate that another will take his place. Curiously, we get no reaction from Sha’ul, who goes back to mustering the troops, and the text sees fit to concentrate on details regarding the Philistines’ technological superiority.

Yonatan the Hero; Sha’ul Errs Again: In strange contrast to the rejection of Sha’ul and his dynasty that has just occurred, Yonatan (full name: Yehonatan), the heir to the throne, proves his mettle by single-handedly killing twenty Philistines. This leads to what looks to be a general rout of the Philistines by his father. In the heat of battle, Sha’ul prohibits any eating until sunset, an oath which, however, is not heard by Yonatan, who unwittingly violates it. To this is added the Israelites’ own breaking of rules, as they eat the animals they have slain along with the blood (a universal, not only Israelite, prohibition according to Gen. 9:4). All is forgiven with the subsequent sacrifice, but Yonatan has to be rescued from his father’s wrath by the Israelites. Once again, Sha’ul has somehow misfired as king, this time within his own family.
The chapter ends with two summaries of Sha’ul’s reign. Vv.47–48 describe him as the great warrior who rescued Israel from six different enemies. Vv.49–52 contain a typical summary list, in this case of Sha’ul’s immediate family members and the name of his commanding general (Avner), along with a note of the ongoing struggle against the Philistines."

that Yonatan son of Sha’ul said to the serving-lad, his weapons bearer:
Come, let’s cross over to the Philistines’ garrison,
the one that is across, over there!
But his father he did not tell."
I Samuel 15:2,"Now Sha’ul was staying at the edge of Geva,
beneath the Pomegranate [Rock] that is in the Migron;
and the fighting-people that were with him were about six hundred men,"
I Samuel 15:3,"while Ahiyya son of Ahituv, brother of I-Khavod, son of Pin’has son of Eli, priest of Y<small>HWH</small> at Shilo, was wearing the <i>efod.</i>
But the people did not know that Yonatan had gone."
I Samuel 15:4,"Now between the gorge-crossings that Yonatan sought to cross, to [get to] the Philistines’ garrison,
was a tooth-shaped cliff over here and a tooth-shaped cliff over there:
the name of the one was Botzetz, and the name of the other was Senne."
I Samuel 15:5,"The one tooth was located on the north, in front of Mikhmas,
while the other was on the south, in front of Geva."
I Samuel 15:6,"Yehonatan said to the lad, his weapons bearer:
Come, let’s cross over to the garrison of these Foreskinned Ones!
Perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will act on our behalf,
for there is nothing to constrain Y<small>HWH</small> from delivering by the many or by the few!"
I Samuel 15:7,"His weapons bearer said to him:
Do whatever your heart inclines to—
here, I am with you, according to your heart!"
I Samuel 15:8,"Yehonatan said:
Here, we are crossing over to the men,
and we will be revealing ourselves to them;"
I Samuel 15:9,"if they say thus to us:
Halt, until we get close to you—
we will stop in our place, and will not go up against them."
I Samuel 15:10,"But if they say thus:
Come up to us—
then we will go up,
for Y<small>HWH</small> will have given them into our hand,
and this will be the sign for us."
I Samuel 15:11,"So the two of them revealed themselves to the Philistines’ garrison,
and the Philistines said:
Here, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they were hiding themselves!"
I Samuel 15:12,"And the men of the garrison yelled out to Yonatan and to his weapons bearer,
and said:
Come up to us,
and we will show you something!
Yonatan said to his weapons bearer:
Come up behind me,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has given them into the hand of Israel!"
I Samuel 15:13,"So Yonatan climbed up by his hands and by his feet, with his weapons bearer behind him.
And they fell before Yonatan, while his weapons bearer dispatched them behind him."
I Samuel 15:14,"Now the first striking-down that Yonatan and his weapons bearer struck was some twenty men,
over about half a furrow for a brace [of oxen plowing] in a field."
I Samuel 15:15,"And there was trembling in the camp, out in the open-field, and among all the fighting-people
—the garrison and the ruinbringers fell-to-trembling, they too, and the earth shuddered;
it was a trembling of God."
I Samuel 15:16,"Now Sha’ul’s watchmen saw at the Hill of Binyamin,
and here, the throng was swaying, going and coming back there."
I Samuel 15:17,"And Sha’ul said to the people who were with him:
Pray count and see who has gone out from us!
They counted, and here: Yonatan and his weapons bearer were not [there],"
I Samuel 15:18,"Sha’ul said to Ahiyya:
Bring close the Coffer of God
—for the Coffer of God was at that time with the Children of Israel."
I Samuel 15:19,"And it was,
as Sha’ul was speaking to the priest,
that the panic that was in the Philistines’ camp went on and on [becoming] greater;
Sha’ul said to the priest:
Withdraw your hand!"
I Samuel 15:20,"And Sha’ul cried out, and all the people that were with him;
they came out to the battle,
and here: each one’s sword was against his neighbor,
an exceedingly great panic."
I Samuel 15:21,"Now the Hebrews [that] had been with the Philistines yesterday [and] the day-before,
in that they had gone up with them to the camp all around,
they too [turned] to be with Israel, who were with Sha’ul and Yonatan,"
I Samuel 15:22,"while all the [other] men of Israel, the ones hiding themselves in the highlands of Efrayim,
heard that the Philistines had fled,
and they too caught up with them in battle."
I Samuel 15:23,"So Y<small>HWH</small> delivered Israel on that day,
and the battle crossed by Bet-Aven."
I Samuel 15:24,"But the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day,
for Sha’ul had put an oath-curse on the fighting-people, saying:
Doomed be the man that eats food until sunset,
that I may be avenged on my enemies!
So all the people did not taste food."
I Samuel 15:25,"Now when all the people came into the forest,
there was honey on the surface of the open-field."
I Samuel 15:26,"And when the people came into the forest,
here: honey was running free,
but no one reached his hand to his mouth,
for the people were afraid of the sworn-oath."
I Samuel 15:27,"Now Yonatan had not heard when his father had made the people swear,
so he stretched out the edge of the staff that was in his hand
and dipped it into the honeycomb;
then he returned his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened."
I Samuel 15:28,"A man from [among] the fighting-people spoke up and said:
Your father had the people swear, yes, swear, saying:
Doomed be the man who eats food today!
And the people grew weary."
I Samuel 15:29,"Yonatan said:
My father has stirred-up-disaster for the land!
Pray see: indeed, my eyes are brightened,
for I tasted this little [bit of] honey;"
I Samuel 15:30,"if the people had eaten, yes, eaten today from their enemies’ spoils that they found,
indeed now, wouldn’t the strike against the Philistines have been greater?"
I Samuel 15:31,"They struck down the Philistines on that day from Mikhmas to Ayalon,
and the people grew exceedingly weary."
I Samuel 15:32,"So the people swooped down on the spoil
and took sheep and cattle and young-cattle, slaughtering them to the ground,
and the people ate [them] with the blood."
I Samuel 15:33,"Someone told Sha’ul, saying:
Here, the people are sinning against Y<small>HWH</small>, in eating with the blood!
He said:
You have [all] broken faith!
Roll me a great stone here."
I Samuel 15:34,"And Sha’ul said:
Scatter among the fighting-people;
you are to say to them:
Each one bring close to me his ox, each one his lamb;
you are to slaughter them here and are to eat,
and you are not to sin against Y<small>HWH</small> by eating with the blood!
So all the people brought close each one his ox in his hand that night, and they slaughtered them there."
I Samuel 15:35,"And Sha’ul built a sacrificial-altar to Y<small>HWH</small>;
it was the first [that he] built as an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 15:36,"Sha’ul said:
Let us go down after the Philistines at night, and plunder among them until the light of daybreak,
and let us not leave a man of them!
They said:
Whatever is good in your eyes, do!
But the priest said:
Let us draw near here to God."
I Samuel 15:37,"So Sha’ul inquired of God:
Shall I go down after the Philistines?
Will you give them into the hand of Israel?
But he did not answer him on that day."
I Samuel 15:38,"Then Sha’ul said:
Come close to here, all the “cornerstones” of the people;
know and take note
wherein this sin occurred today."
I Samuel 15:39,"For by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, who delivers Israel,
for even if it be Yonatan my son,
indeed, he will die, yes, die!
But no one answered him from all the people."
I Samuel 15:40,"He said to all Israel:
You be on one side,
and I and Yonatan my son will be on one side.
The people said to Sha’ul:
What is good in your eyes, do!"
I Samuel 15:41,"Sha’ul said to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Give <i>tammim!</i>
Yonatan and Sha’ul were captured-by-lot,
and the people escaped."
I Samuel 15:42,"Then Sha’ul said:
Cast [lots] between me and Yonatan my son!
And Yonatan was captured-by-lot."
I Samuel 15:43,"Sha’ul said to Yonatan:
Tell me what you have done!
So Yonatan told him;
he said:
I tasted, yes, tasted with the edge of the staff that was in my hand, a little honey.
Here I am; I will die."
I Samuel 15:44,"Sha’ul said:
Thus may God do, and thus may he add,
for you shall die, yes, die, Yonatan!"
I Samuel 15:45,"But the people said to Sha’ul:
Shall Yonatan die, who has wrought this great victory in Israel?
[Heaven] forbid, by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
if a [single] hair of his head should fall to the ground … !
For with God he has acted this day!
Thus the people redeemed Yonatan, so that he did not die."
I Samuel 15:46,"And Sha’ul went up from [pursuing] after the Philistines,
while the Philistines went back to their place."
I Samuel 15:47,"Now when Sha’ul had captured the kingship over Israel,
he waged battle all around against all his enemies:
against Moav, against the Children of Ammon, against Edom, against the king of Tzova, and against the Philistines;
and wherever he faced, he was victorious."
I Samuel 15:48,"He did valiantly: he struck down Amalek
and rescued Israel from the hand of its pillager.

Sha’ul Rejected II: Chap. 13 and the present one appear to be separate accounts of Sha’ul’s rejection. This is buttressed by the opening of Chap. 15, which seems oblivious to the previous events. God commands the king to utterly wipe out the Amalekites, in revenge for their treacherous actions against the Israelite ancestors at the time of the Exodus (see Exod. 17:8–16). Sha’ul is scrupulous here in one regard, making sure that the Israel-friendly Kenites who live among the enemy are not caught up in the destruction, but in the end he chooses to preserve both the best of the spoils and Agag, the Amalekite king, thus violating God’s instructions.
When confronted by Shemuel, Sha’ul claims to have done God’s will, and to have saved the best animals for sacrifice to him. Further rebuke from the prophet reveals the truth: Sha’ul was afraid of his own soldiers, fearing that they, following usual practice, would not fight without promise of a reward in the form of spoils. Such a disregard of God’s honor in favor of human considerations means that Sha’ul must now forfeit his role as the founder of a dynasty, expressed through the fourfold use of “reject” in vv.23 and 26.
Despite the condemnation directed at Sha’ul, the text strikingly portrays Shemuel as feeling for the king; when God first expresses regret over having made Sha’ul king, Shemuel “cried out … all night” (v.11), while at the end of the chapter (vv.30–31) he accedes to Sha’ul’s request to at least accompany him as he worships in the people’s presence. Shemuel, of course, does not extend this kind of humanity to Agag and, as far as we can tell, executes him with his own hands. But the close association between king and prophet, which had begun in the long-ago days of running after lost donkeys, would seem to have come to an end."
I Samuel 15:74,"Now the sons of Sha’ul were:
Yonatan, Yishvi, and Malki-Shua.
And the name of his two daughters:
the name of the firstborn was Merav,
and the name of the younger-one was Mikhal."
I Samuel 15:75,"And the name of Sha’ul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaatz.
And the name of the commander of his armed-forces was Aviner, son of Ner, Sha’ul’s uncle."
I Samuel 15:76,"Now Kish was the father of Sha’ul, and Ner was the father of Avner, the son of Aviel."
I Samuel 15:77,"And the war was strong against the Philistines all the days of Sha’ul;
whenever Sha’ul would see any mighty man, or any valiant one,
he would gather him to him."
I Samuel 16:1,"Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
It is I [whom] Y<small>HWH</small> sent to anoint you as king over his people, over Israel;
so-now, hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>’s words:"
I Samuel 16:2,"Thus says Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High:
I have taken account of what Amalek did to Israel,
how he set upon him on the journey, on his going up from Egypt."
I Samuel 16:3,"Now,
go and strike down Amalek;
you are to devote-to-destruction all that is his
—you are not to spare him,
but are to put to death [everyone]
from man to woman,
from child to suckling,
from ox to sheep,
from camel to donkey!"
I Samuel 16:4,"So Sha’ul summoned the fighting-people
and counted them [for war] in Tela’im:
two hundred thousand foot-soldiers
along with ten thousand, the men of Judah."
I Samuel 16:5,"And Sha’ul came to the city of Amalek,
and lay-in-ambush in the wadi."
I Samuel 16:6,"Now Sha’ul said to the Kenites:
Come, turn aside, go down from amid the Amalekites,
lest I sweep you away with them!
For you—you acted with loyalty with all the Children of Israel on their going up from Egypt.
So the Kenites turned aside from amid Amalek."
I Samuel 16:7,"And Sha’ul struck down Amalek, from Havila as far as where-you- come to Shur, which is facing Egypt."
I Samuel 16:8,"He seized Agag king of Amalek alive,
while all the people he devoted-to-destruction with the mouth of the sword."
I Samuel 16:9,"But Sha’ul and the people spared Agag
and the best of the sheep and the cattle, the fat ones, the lambs and all that was goodly;
they would not devote them to destruction—
[only] all the property despised and rejected,
<i>that</i> they devoted-to-destruction."
I Samuel 16:10,"Now the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Shemuel, saying:"
I Samuel 16:11,"I repent
that I kinged Sha’ul as king,
for he has turned from [following] after me;
my word he has not fulfilled!
Shemuel was agitated,
and he cried out to Y<small>HWH</small> all night."
I Samuel 16:12,"Shemuel started-early to meet Sha’ul at daybreak,
and it was told to Shemuel, saying:
Sha’ul has gone to Carmel
—here, he is setting up a monument for himself—
so he turned about, crossed over, and went down to Gilgal."
I Samuel 16:13,"Shemuel came to Sha’ul,
and Sha’ul said to him:
Blessed are you of Y<small>HWH</small>;
I have fulfilled the word of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Samuel 16:14,"But Shemuel said:
Then what is this sound of sheep in my ears,
and the sound of oxen that I hear?"
I Samuel 16:15,"Sha’ul said:
From the Amalekites they have brought them,
and what the people spared as the best of the sheep and the oxen,
in order to sacrifice them to Y<small>HWH</small> your God;
what was left we devoted-to-destruction."
I Samuel 16:16,"Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
Leave off, and I will tell you what Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to me during the night.
He said to him: Speak!"
I Samuel 16:17,"Shemuel said:
Though you may be too small in your own eyes,
you are head of the tribes of Israel,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has anointed you as king over Israel!"
I Samuel 16:18,"Now Y<small>HWH</small> sent you on a journey;
he said:
Go, devote-to-destruction the sinners, Amalek!
You are to wage battle against them, until you have finished them off."
I Samuel 16:19,"So why did you not hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>?
You swooped down on the spoils
and did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Samuel 16:20,"Sha’ul said to Shemuel:
I did hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>!
I went on the journey on which Y<small>HWH</small> sent me:
I brought back Agag king of Amalek,
while Amalek I devoted-to-destruction;"
I Samuel 16:21,"but the people took from the spoils
sheep and oxen, the premier-part of what was devoted,
to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> your God at Gilgal!"
I Samuel 16:22,"Shemuel said:
Is there pleasure for Y<small>HWH</small> in offerings and sacrifices
more than in hearkening to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>?
Here, hearkening is better than sacrifice,
attention than the fat of rams."
I Samuel 16:23,"Indeed, [like] the sin of diviners is revolt,
[like] the iniquity of <i>terafim</i> is arrogance.
Because you have rejected the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,
he has rejected you as king!"
I Samuel 16:24,"Sha’ul said to Shemuel:
I have sinned;
indeed, I have crossed the order of Y<small>HWH</small> and your words,
for I was afraid of the people,
and so I hearkened to their voice!"
I Samuel 16:25,"But-now,
pray bear away my sin
and return with me, so that I may bow down to Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Samuel 16:26,"Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
I will not return with you,
for you have rejected the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so Y<small>HWH</small> has rejected you from being king over Israel!"
I Samuel 16:27,"And Shemuel turned about to go,
but he held on to the corner of his cloak, so that it tore."
I Samuel 16:28,"Shemuel said to him:
Y<small>HWH</small> has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today
and will give it to your fellow, the one better than you!"
I Samuel 16:29,"And also: the Eternal One of Israel does not speak-falsely and does not repent—
for he is not a human-being, to repent!"
I Samuel 16:30,"He said:
I have sinned—
now, pray honor me in front of the elders of my people, in front of Israel:
return with me, so that I may bow down to Y<small>HWH</small> your God!"
I Samuel 16:31,"So Shemuel returned after Sha’ul,
and Sha’ul bowed down to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 16:32,"Then Shemuel said:
Bring close to me Agag king of Amalek!
Agag went to him with faltering-steps;
Agag said:
Indeed, the distress of death is near!"
I Samuel 16:33,"Shemuel said:
Since bereaved were women by your sword,
may the most bereaved of women be your mother!
And Shemuel slashed Agag [to pieces] in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> at Gilgal."
I Samuel 16:34,"Then Shemuel went back to Rama,
while Sha’ul went up to his house at the Hill of Sha’ul."
I Samuel 16:35,"And Shemuel did not see Sha’ul again until the day of his death,
for Shemuel was mourning over Sha’ul,
while Y<small>HWH</small> had repented that he had made Sha’ul king over Israel.

I Samuel 16:52,"<b>Since bereaved … :</b> The last word of each line rhymes in the Hebrew, creating a more dramatic effect. <b>slashed … [to pieces]:</b> Heb. unclear, but <i>sh-s-f</i> fits the general category of <i>sh-s-x</i> verbs, all of which mean something violent like “plunder” or “cleave.”
David Chosen and at Court: With Sha’ul now rejected and destined to be the last of his own dynasty to rule, the text turns to the anointing of his successor, the Judean David. Compared to the convoluted accounts of Sha’ul’s accession to the throne in Chaps. 9–10, the story in which David makes his first appearance is almost an idyll. It also fits a classic folklore pattern which we first encountered in multiple manifestations in Genesis: the choosing or triumph of the younger brother. Here, as in many fairy tales, the youngest appears last, and, like Sha’ul, he is initially hidden.
The text makes the event a journey of discovery for Shemuel. God does not reveal the new king’s name to the prophet in advance, nor is it mentioned until the very end of the chapter, after the anointing. Shemuel, like us, will have to learn the criteria for divine choice. Perhaps he is blinded by Sha’ul’s failures, which he himself has taken to heart (note God’s question in v.1: “Until when will you keep on mourning for Sha’ul?”). In any event, God’s speech in v.7 centers around the idea of “seeing,” a verb and an activity that are typically associated with prophecy in the Bible (as in 9:9, above). It is used ten times in eighteen verses of the text. So the little tale incorporates both physical and figurative aspects of seeing: appearance, foresight, and insight.
The fact that David is a shepherd resonates strongly in ancient culture. Moshe, of course, had followed the same vocation as an adult. The poetry of the Bible frequently contains shepherd imagery, most famously in Ps. 23 and the Song of Songs, and the figure of the Shepherd King, so beloved in the ancient Near East, easily survived to become a central motif in early Christianity.
David starts on his biblical path with formidable tools. He is physically attractive and possessed of the “spirit of Y<small>HWH</small>,” like some of the leaders before him in the book of Judges. In addition, the end of our chapter reveals him as a string musician, a skill sometimes also associated with prophecy in the Bible (see II Kings 3:15). At the same time that this talent of David is described, we also learn of his reputation as a warrior. Clearly this is no ordinary shepherd boy.
The section already begins what will develop into an epic struggle, not only between the two men, but between two dynastic houses. Its echo was to endure long after their own deaths."
I Samuel 17:1,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
Until when will you keep on mourning for Sha’ul,
when I myself have rejected him from reigning as king over Israel?
Fill your horn with oil and go:
I am sending you to Yishai the Bet-Lehemite,
for I have seen among his sons a king for me."
I Samuel 17:2,"Shemuel said:
How can I go?
If Sha’ul were to hear, he would kill me!
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
A she-calf of the herd you are to take in your hand,
and you are to say:
It is to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> [that] I have come."
I Samuel 17:3,"Then you are to invite Yishai for the sacrificial-meal,
and I myself will make known to you what you are to do:
you are to anoint for me the one that I tell you."
I Samuel 17:4,"Shemuel did what Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken;
he came to Bet-Lehem.
The elders of the town trembled [going] to meet him,
they said:
Is it in peace, your coming?"
I Samuel 17:5,"He said:
In peace—
it is to sacrifice to Y<small>HWH</small> [that] I have come!
Hallow yourselves,
so that you may come with me to the sacrificial-meal.
So he hallowed Yishai and his sons
and invited them to the sacrificial-meal."
I Samuel 17:6,"Now it was, when they came,
that he saw Eli’av;
he said [to himself]:
Surely before Y<small>HWH</small> is his anointed one!"
I Samuel 17:7,"But Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shemuel:
Do not look at what you see of him, or at the tallness of his stature,
for I have rejected him!
For [God sees] not as a human being sees—
for a human being sees the [outer] aspect, but Y<small>HWH</small> sees the heart."
I Samuel 17:8,"Then Yishai called Avinadav, and had him pass before Shemuel,
but he said:
Also this one, Y<small>HWH</small> has not chosen."
I Samuel 17:9,"And Yishai had Shamma pass by,
but he said:
Also this one, Y<small>HWH</small> has not chosen."
I Samuel 17:10,"Yishai had his seven sons pass before Shemuel,
but Shemuel said to Yishai:
Y<small>HWH</small> has not chosen these!"
I Samuel 17:11,"Then Shemuel said to Yishai:
Are the lads at-an-end?
He said:
There still remains the youngest—
here, he is shepherding the flock.
Shemuel said to Yishai:
Send and fetch him,
for we will not sit around [the table] until his coming here."
I Samuel 17:12,"He sent and had him come
—now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes, and goodly in appearance.
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Arise, anoint him, for this is he!"
I Samuel 17:13,"So Shemuel took the horn of oil and anointed him amid his brothers.
And the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> advanced upon David from that day and onward.
Then Shemuel arose and went [back] to Rama.

I Samuel 18:8,"<b>the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> advanced upon David:</b> Previously, the expression had been used three times about the mighty Shimshon (Judg. 14:6, 19, 15:14). <b>David:</b> Pronounced <i>dah-VEED.</i> This is the first occurrence of the name, which means “beloved.”
David and Golyat: Perhaps the most famous story about David, this narrative appears to have its own independent history, which, however, is difficult to untangle. Unlike most other instances, here MT is much longer than LXX. Sections exclusive to the Hebrew version are vv.12–31 (the introduction of David and his reaction to Golyat’s taunting), 41 and 48b (minor variations), 50, and 55–58 (Sha’ul inexplicably asking about David’s identity as if he had never met him previously, Chap. 16 notwithstanding). Most scholars have concluded from this that there are two traditions at work in some form, or that an “original” has given birth to one or two later versions through expansion or contraction. Given that the LXX version reads coherently on its own, many infer that MT here is in fact an expansion. Following the model of the Sinai account in Exod. 19 (see Greenberg), our present text might be viewed as a composite, a gathering of different traditions in a manner that makes for richness and completeness, despite our Western need for total coherence (Alter 1998). In a wider sense, it reflects the Bible’s general aspect of textual inclusiveness—what I would call multivocality, in which competing and even contradictory accounts are allowed to coexist for the sake of fullness.
In addition to the textual issues, a battle account near the end of the book, in II Sam. 21:19, mentions how “Elhanan son of Yaarei-Oregim the Bet-Lehemite struck down Golyat the Gittite / —now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam,” and the same hero is identified as having killed Golyat’s brother in I Chron. 20:5. This suggests that we are dealing with an independent story which has been placed on David’s shoulders, for obvious reasons.
Regardless of its various permutations, the long, leisurely David/Golyat narrative reads much like a fairy tale, and is in many respects quite accessible to many cultures. It has never lost its popularity, and the phrase “David and Goliath,” used to describe everything from business competition to sporting events, is still very much in common use. The setup is classic: a huge warrior with a reputation as a champion—“the Man of the Space-Between [the armies]” (v.4)—strides forth, mocking his enemies and challenging them to a one-on-one duel. The detailed description of Golyat’s armor is a departure from the usually sparse biblical landscape, but it is certainly psychologically appropriate here, as are the other rare biblical descriptions of a person’s attire (Hamilton).
Of course, neither Sha’ul nor any of his soldiers dares fight the Philistine. It is left to a teenager untried in standard weaponry to face him. The text is clear about David’s inexperience in formal battle, but it needs to be pointed out that, although he is not a professional warrior, he is also no slouch. His description of fighting off lions and bears in his shepherd days (vv.34–36) is not a vain or irrelevant boast; in addition, v.51 describes him deftly unsheathing Golyat’s sword and finishing off the Philistine with it. Further, David’s wielding of a sling to defeat Golyat should not be trivialized. In ancient warfare, a division of slingers could be quite lethal (see the Greek account in Xenophon’s <i>Anabasis,</i> or, previously in the Bible, Judg. 20:16).
In addition to the detailed military descriptions, which sound more like Homer than the Bible, the story focuses on memorable confrontations between pairs of characters: Golyat and the Israelites (vv.8–11); David and his brother Eli’av (28–29); David and Sha’ul (32–39); and, finally, David and Golyat (42–47). The last and most significant one will vault David’s prowess and fame beyond that of regular warriors, his family, and Sha’ul.
The most surprising aspect of this tale is that it is not only, as popularly understood, a case of the weak against the strong, the small against the large. Its vocabulary in fact leads in a different direction. Only here, of all the biblical texts concerning war, does the word “ranks” occur repeatedly (twelve times); the other recurring word is the verb “mock.” This leads naturally to the conclusion that what is really at stake is the fact that “this foreskinned Philistine” has “mock[ed] the ranks of the Living God” (v.26). In other words, the story, splendidly illustrating the rise of David, centers around the perceived insult to Y<small>HWH</small> and his earthly armies, which must be properly avenged. Golyat’s literal downfall accomplishes this; his posture of falling “on his face to the ground” (v.49) is more reminiscent of proper respect and worship than the simple act of keeling over.
There is one other biblical text that takes up the issue of “mocking” God using this language: II Kings 18, where the Assyrian king’s representatives taunt King Hezekiah and Y<small>HWH</small> in full hearing of the Judean troops. It is thus quite plausible that an old story has here been retold in terms and vocabulary that address the needs of a later audience."
I Samuel 18:9,"Now the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> departed from Sha’ul,
and an evil spirit from Y<small>HWH</small> began to torment him."
I Samuel 18:10,"Sha’ul’s servants said to him:
Now here, an evil spirit of God is tormenting you;"
I Samuel 18:11,"pray let our lord speak—your servants [stand ready] before you:
let them look for a man,
one who knows how to strum the lyre,
so that it may be, whenever there is upon you an evil spirit of God,
he may strum with his hand, and it will be well with you."
I Samuel 18:12,"Sha’ul said to his servants:
Pray select for me a man who strums well,
and have him come to me!"
I Samuel 18:13,"One of the serving-lads spoke up and said:
Here, I have seen a son of Yishai the Bet-Lehemite, [one] who knows how to strum;
a mighty-man of valor,
a man of battle,
skilled in words,
a man of [pleasing] form,
and Y<small>HWH</small> is with him!"
I Samuel 18:14,"So Sha’ul sent messengers to Yishai, he said:
Send me David your son, who is with the flock!"
I Samuel 18:15,"Yishai took a donkey [laden with] bread and a skin of wine, and one goat kid,
and sent them by the hand of David his son, to Sha’ul."
I Samuel 18:16,"David came to Sha’ul, and stood before him;
he grew to love him exceedingly,
and he became his weapons bearer."
I Samuel 18:17,"And Sha’ul sent to Yishai, saying:
Now let David stand [in attendance] before me, for he has found favor in my eyes."
I Samuel 18:18,"And so it would be:
whenever the spirit of God was upon Sha’ul,
that David would take up the lyre and strum [it] with his hand;
Sha’ul would have respite, and it would be well with him,
and the evil spirit would depart from him."
I Samuel 19:1,"Now the Philistines gathered their encampments for battle;
they gathered themselves at Sokho, which is in Yehuda,
and encamped between Sokho and Azeka, at Efes-Dammim,"
I Samuel 19:2,"while Sha’ul and the men of Israel gathered and encamped in the Valley of the Oak,
and arranged-ranks for battle to meet the Philistines."
I Samuel 19:3,"Now the Philistines were stationed on a hill, on this-side,
while Israel was stationed on a hill, on that-side,
with the ravine between them."
I Samuel 19:4,"And the Man of the Space-Between came out, from the Philistine camps—
Golyat his name, from Gat:
his height was six cubits and a span;"
I Samuel 19:5,"a helmet of bronze was on his head,
with armor of scales he was clothed
—the weight of the armor was five thousand <i>shekel</i>-weights of bronze;"
I Samuel 19:6,"greaves of bronze were on his legs,
and a scimitar of bronze was between his shoulders;"
I Samuel 19:7,"the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam,
while the flashing-point of his spear was six hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights of iron,
and the shield bearer was walking before him."
I Samuel 19:8,"He stood and called out to the ranks of Israel;
he said to them:
Why do you come out and arrange-ranks in battle?
Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Sha’ul?
Pick yourselves a man, that he may come down to me!"
I Samuel 19:9,"If he prevails in doing battle with me and strikes me down,
then we will become your servants,
but if I prevail against him and strike him down,
then you will become our servants, and will have to serve us!"
I Samuel 19:10,"And the Philistine said:
As for me,
I mock the ranks of Israel this day—
give me a man, and let us do battle together!"
I Samuel 19:11,"Sha’ul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
and they were dismayed and exceedingly frightened."
I Samuel 19:12,"Now David was the son of this Efratite man, from Bet-Lehem in Judah
whose name was Yishai—he had eight sons.
And the man, in the days of Sha’ul, was old, advanced [in age] among men."
I Samuel 19:13,"Now they had gone, the three oldest sons of Yishai,
gone after Sha’ul, into battle
—the name[s] of his three sons who had gone to battle were:
Eli’av, the firstborn,
and his second, Avinadav,
and the third one, Shamma."
I Samuel 19:14,"As for David, he was the youngest,
while the three oldest ones had gone [to follow] after Sha’ul."
I Samuel 19:15,"Now David would go and return from [attending] upon Sha’ul,
to shepherd the flock of his father in Bet-Lehem."
I Samuel 19:16,"And the Philistine came close, early and late, and presented himself for forty days."
I Samuel 19:17,"Yishai said to David his son:
Now take your brothers this <i>efa</i> of parched-grain, and these ten bread-loaves,
and run them out to the camp to your brothers,"
I Samuel 19:18,"and these ten cuts of milk-cheese, bring to the Commander of a Thousand.
As for your brothers, take account of [their] welfare,
and bring back assurance from them—"
I Samuel 19:19,for Sha’ul and they and all the fighting-men of Israel in the Valley of the Oak are doing battle with the Philistines.
I Samuel 19:20,"So David started-early in the morning;
he left the flock with a watchman,
lifted up [the food] and went, as Yishai had charged him, and came to the circular-camp,
as the army was going out to the ranks and was shouting in battle."
I Samuel 19:21,"And Israel and the Philistines were arranged-in-ranks, rank opposite rank."
I Samuel 19:22,"David let down the gear from him, in the hand of a watchman of gear,
and ran to the ranks.
When he arrived, he asked about his brothers, about [their] welfare."
I Samuel 19:23,"While he was speaking with them,
here, the Man of the Space-Between was coming up, Golyat the Philistine his name, from Gat, from the ranks of the Philistines.
He spoke according to those words, and David heard."
I Samuel 19:24,"Now all the fighting-men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled before him,
for they were exceedingly afraid."
I Samuel 19:25,"A man of Israel said:
Do you see this man who comes up?
Indeed, it is to mock Israel that he comes up!
Now it will be: the man who strikes him down, the king will enrich him with great riches,
and his daughter he will give him,
and his Father’s House he will make free in Israel!"
I Samuel 19:26,"David said to the men who were standing with him, saying:
What shall be done for the man who strikes down this Philistine and removes the mocking from upon Israel?
For who is this foreskinned Philistine
that he should mock the ranks of the Living God?"
I Samuel 19:27,"The people told him according to those words, saying:
Thus shall be done for the man who strikes him down."
I Samuel 19:28,"Now Eli’av his oldest brother heard as he was speaking to the men,
and Eli’av’s anger flared up against David;
he said:
Why now have you come down, and with whom have you left that little flock in the wilderness?
I know your presumption and the evil-intentions of your heart—
indeed, it is in order to see the battle that you have come down here!"
I Samuel 19:29,"David said:
What have I done now? It was only words!"
I Samuel 19:30,"He went around him, facing another,
and spoke to him according to those words,
and the people answered him with words according to the former words."
I Samuel 19:31,"Now the words that David had spoken were heard;
they told them in the presence of Sha’ul, and he had him fetched."
I Samuel 19:32,"David said to Sha’ul:
Do not let anyone’s heart fail him;
your servant will go and do battle with this Philistine!"
I Samuel 19:33,"But Sha’ul said to David:
You cannot prevail in going against this Philistine, to do battle with him,
for you are a lad,
while he has been a man of battle since his youth!"
I Samuel 19:34,"David said to Sha’ul:
Your servant was a shepherd of the flock for his father,
and whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock,"
I Samuel 19:35,"I would go out after it and strike it down, and rescue it from its mouth;
if it rose against me, I would take hold of it by its beard, strike it down, and put it to death."
I Samuel 19:36,"Even the lion, even the bear did your servant strike down—
so this foreskinned Philistine will be like one of them,
for he has mocked the ranks of the Living God!"
I Samuel 19:37,"And David said:
Y<small>HWH</small>,
who rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear,
he will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine!
Sha’ul said to David:
Go, and may Y<small>HWH</small> be with you!"
I Samuel 19:38,"And Sha’ul clothed David in his military-garb:
he placed a helmet of bronze on his head
and clothed him in armor."
I Samuel 19:39,"David strapped on his sword over his garb,
but he was unable to walk, since he was not used [to them].
David said to Sha’ul:
I cannot walk with these, since I am not used [to them].
So David removed them from himself."
I Samuel 19:40,"He took his stick in his hand
and chose himself five smooth stones from the wadi
and put them in the shepherd’s bag that he had, namely, in the pouch, with his sling in his hand,
and approached the Philistine."
I Samuel 19:41,"The Philistine went, going along and coming nearer to David, with the man, the shield bearer, before him."
I Samuel 19:42,"And the Philistine looked out and saw David, and taunted him,
for he was a lad,
and ruddy, beautiful of appearance."
I Samuel 19:43,"The Philistine said to David:
Am I a dog,
that you come at me with sticks?
And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."
I Samuel 19:44,"And the Philistine said to David:
Come to me,
that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field!"
I Samuel 19:45,"But David said to the Philistine:
You come at me
with sword and spear and scimitar,
but I come at you
with the name of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High,
the God of the ranks of Israel, whom you have mocked!"
I Samuel 19:46,"This day Y<small>HWH</small> will turn you over into my hand,
so that I will strike you down
and will remove your head from you;
I will give your carcass and the carcass of the Philistine camp this day
to the birds of the heavens and to the wildlife of the earth,
so that all the earth may know that Israel has a God,"
I Samuel 19:47,"and that all this assembly may know
that it is not with a sword or with a spear that Y<small>HWH</small> delivers—
for the battle is Y<small>HWH</small>’s,
and he will give [all of] you into our hand!"
I Samuel 19:48,"And it was, when the Philistine arose and came near to meet David,
that David quickly ran toward the ranks to meet the Philistine."
I Samuel 19:49,"David stretched out his hand to the bag
and took from there a stone, and slung it,
and struck the Philistine on his forehead:
the stone sank into his forehead
and he fell on his face to the ground."
I Samuel 19:50,"So David overpowered the Philistine with a sling and a stone;
he struck down the Philistine and put him to death,
yet no sword was in David’s hand."
I Samuel 19:51,"And David ran and stood over the Philistine
and took his sword and drew it from its sheath
and dispatched him;
he cut off his head with it.
The Philistines saw that their mighty-man was dead, so they fled,"
I Samuel 19:52,"and the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted;
they pursued after the Philistines as far as where you come to the ravine, as far as the gates of Ekron,
and the Philistine slain fell in the road to Shaarayim/Double-Gate, as far as Gat, as far as Ekron."
I Samuel 19:53,"The Children of Israel returned from dashing-hotly after the Philistines, and they pillaged their camp."
I Samuel 19:54,"And David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem, while his gear he put in his tent."
I Samuel 19:55,"Now when Sha’ul saw David going out to meet the Philistine,
he said to Avner, commander of the armed-forces:
Whose son is this lad, Avner?
Avner said:
As you live, O king, if I know …"
I Samuel 19:56,"The king said:
Make inquiry yourself:
Whose son is this youth?"
I Samuel 19:57,"So when David returned from striking down the Philistine,
Avner took him and brought him before Sha’ul,
with the head of the Philistine in his hand.

I Samuel 20:16,"<b>dog:</b> This motif, one of insult, repeats in the following chapters. Here it contrasts nicely with David’s mastery over lions and bears (vv.34–36) (Fokkelman 1993). <b>sticks:</b> Heb. <i>maklot,</i> sounding similar to the immediately following <i>vaykallel,</i> “cursed.”"

I Samuel 20:20,<b>Gat … Ekron:</b> All the way back to the Philistine cities.
I Samuel 20:21,"<b>Jerusalem:</b> Another anomaly in the text; it will not be an Israelite city until David himself conquers it in II Sam. 5. Similarly, as a nonwarrior, David would not have had his own tent."
I Samuel 20:22,"<b>Whose son:</b> Since in the ancient Near East, kings were sometimes referred to as “sons of the gods,” Sha’ul’s question is not as innocent as it seems, at least to the audience. See II Sam. 7:14.
The Rise of David in Sha’ul’s House I: As if the Golyat story were not dramatic enough, the artistry of the text continues unabated in the chapters that follow. The present one highlights “love,” its chief theme word: the love borne David by Yehonatan, Sha’ul’s heir; by the Israelites, who are dazzled by David’s military exploits; and by Sha’ul’s daughter Mikhal, who not surprisingly falls for the young hero. Contrasted to this and to David’s “prospering” (vv.5, 14, 15, 30) is the jealous rage into which Sha’ul’s emotions propel him. Whether the “evil spirit from YHWH” (v.10, and see 16:14) is related to Sha’ul’s depression over having been rejected by God, or is due to a previously existing psychological state, the rise of his young rival only magnifies it. Whereas in Chap. 16 David’s lyre playing had been able to soothe the ailing king, it now spawns elaborate scheming and an outbreak of personal violence.
The precise nature of the love between David and Yehonatan has been a prime subject of speculation in recent interpretations of this text. In today’s terms, the language appears strongly suggestive of a sexual relationship, although the text does not elaborate on this. Alternatively, if one reads the story in a nonsexual way, it may be reflecting a warrior society, in which male bonding has always been central. A further possibility is that the relationship is playing an ironic role in the text: the person about whom each cares the most is the one with whom he has the greatest potential political conflict.
The David-Yehonatan relationship has been explicated by Ackerman in a book-length study (2005). She notes that the text, while not explicit, does utilize vocabulary that elsewhere in the Bible is clearly sexual, and that in general Yehonatan occupies a role that is emotionally and politically subordinate to David (see I Sam. 18:4, 28:13–15, and 23:17). If one accepts these arguments, the text may be putting forward a striking, if symbolic, example of how David will triumph over the House of Sha’ul.
In any event, as with all biblical texts, readers will find multiple ways to read the same passage."
I Samuel 20:23,"Sha’ul said to him:
Whose son are you, [my] lad?
David said:
The son of your servant Yishai the Bet-Lehemite."
I Samuel 21:1,"It was, when he finished speaking to Sha’ul,
—now Yehonatan’s own self became bound up with David’s self,
so that Yehonatan loved him like his own self—"
I Samuel 21:2,"that Sha’ul took him [into service] on that day,
and did not give him [leave] to return to his Father’s House."
I Samuel 21:3,"And Yehonatan and David cut a covenant,
because of his love for him, like his own self."
I Samuel 21:4,"Yehonatan stripped off the cloak that he had on and gave it to David,
along with his [military] garb, including his sword, including his bow, and including his belt."
I Samuel 21:5,"David went out,
and everywhere that Sha’ul sent him, he prospered.
Sha’ul placed him over the men of war,
and it was good in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of Sha’ul’s servants."
I Samuel 21:6,"And it was upon their coming back, upon David’s return from striking the Philistine,
that women came out from all the towns in Israel, for singing and dances,
to meet King Sha’ul with timbrels, with joyful-sounds and with triangles."
I Samuel 21:7,"And the dancing women chanted and said:
Sha’ul has struck down his thousands,
but David—his myriads!"
I Samuel 21:8,"Sha’ul became exceedingly agitated,
and this matter was evil in his eyes;
he said [to himself]:
They give-credit to David for myriads,
but to me they give-credit for thousands!
There yet [remains] for him only the kingdom!"
I Samuel 21:9,And Sha’ul was keeping-an-eye on David from that day onward.
I Samuel 21:10,"Now it was on the morrow
that an evil spirit of God advanced upon Sha’ul, and he ranted-like- a-prophet in the midst of the palace-house,
while David was strumming with his hand, as day after day.
Now there was a spear in Sha’ul’s hand,"
I Samuel 21:11,"and Sha’ul hurled the spear; he said [to himself]:
I will strike David and the wall [together]!
But David evaded him twice."
I Samuel 21:12,"And Sha’ul was afraid before David,
for Y<small>HWH</small> was with him,
while from Sha’ul he had turned away."
I Samuel 21:13,"So Sha’ul kept him away from [being] beside him;
he made him commander of a thousand,
and he went out and came back before the people."
I Samuel 21:14,"David was prospering in all his ways,
and Y<small>HWH</small> was with him."
I Samuel 21:15,"And Sha’ul saw that he was prospering exceedingly, and he was in dread before him,"
I Samuel 21:16,"but all Israel and Judah loved David,
for he was going out and coming back before them."
I Samuel 21:17,"Sha’ul said to David:
Here is my oldest daughter, Merav—
her I will give you as a wife;
only be a son of valor for me
and fight the battles of Y<small>HWH</small>!
—For Sha’ul said [to himself]:
Let not my own hand be against him,
but let the Philistines’ hand be against him!"
I Samuel 21:18,"David said to Sha’ul:
Who am I and who are my living-relatives, my father’s clan in Israel,
that I should become son-in-law to the king?"
I Samuel 21:19,"But it was,
at the time for giving Merav daughter of Sha’ul to David,
that she was given to Adriel the Maholatite as a wife."
I Samuel 21:20,"Now Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul had fallen in love with David,
and when it was told to Sha’ul, the matter was right in his eyes."
I Samuel 21:21,"Sha’ul said [to himself]:
I will give her to him,
that she may become a snare to him,
and that the Philistines’ hand may be against him!
So Sha’ul said to David a second-time:
You are to become-a-son-in-law to me today!"
I Samuel 21:22,"And Sha’ul charged his servants:
Speak to David secretly, saying:
Here, the king is pleased with you,
and all his servants love you;
so-now, become-a-son-in-law to the king!"
I Samuel 21:23,"Sha’ul’s servants spoke these words in David’s ears.
But David said:
Is it a light-thing in your eyes, becoming-a-son-in-law to the king
—for I am a man poor and lightly-regarded!"
I Samuel 21:24,"Sha’ul’s servants told him, saying:
According to these words did David speak."
I Samuel 21:25,"Sha’ul said:
Say thus to David:
The king takes no pleasure in any bride-price except for a hundred Philistine foreskins,
to be avenged on the king’s enemies
—for Sha’ul planned to cause David’s fall by the Philistines’ hand."
I Samuel 21:26,"His servants told David all these words,
and the matter was right in David’s eyes to become-son-in-law to the king.

The Rise of David in Sha’ul’s House II: Having been entranced by David in the previous chapter, Sha’ul’s children now actively take his side against their father. At first, Yehonatan’s intercession works, and his friend is restored to his position at the king’s side. But the “evil spirit” in Sha’ul cannot be denied, especially after another report of David’s successes in battle (v.8), and he once again hurls his spear at the young musician. David’s subsequent flight is the beginning of a long period of running which will end only with Sha’ul’s death. He is aided in his escape by his wife, Mikhal, who, in a scene of deception that vaguely recalls Rahel’s tricking of her father in Gen. 31:34–35, makes use of what are apparently household idols to fool the king’s messengers.
But such help is not sufficient. David needs divine protection from Sha’ul, and the king’s messengers are disoriented by “ranting-in-prophecy,” followed by Sha’ul himself. While in Chap. 10 above, such behavior might have suggested the king’s special gifts and hence leadership capabilities, here, in what is perhaps originally an alternate tradition, it reduces him to a helpless babbler, and David goes unharmed. Curiously, Shemuel never feels Sha’ul’s wrath for accompanying David here."
I Samuel 22:12,"when David arose and went, he and his men,
and he struck down two hundred men of the Philistines.
And David brought their foreskins and paid-them-in-full to the king,
to become-son-in-law to the king,
and Sha’ul gave him Mikhal his daughter as a wife."
I Samuel 22:13,"Sha’ul took note and knew that Y<small>HWH</small> was with David,
while Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul loved him."
I Samuel 22:14,"And Sha’ul continued to be afraid of David, even more;
Sha’ul was bearing-enmity to David all the days."
I Samuel 22:15,"The Philistine commanders went out [to battle],
and it was: as often as they went out, David prospered more than all of Sha’ul’s servants,
so that his name became exceedingly esteemed."
I Samuel 23:1,"And Sha’ul spoke to Yonatan his son and to all his servants
about causing David’s death,
but Yehonatan son of Sha’ul took exceeding pleasure in David,"
I Samuel 23:2,"so Yehonatan told David, saying:
Sha’ul my father is seeking to cause your death.
So-now, pray take care in the morning
that you stay in a secret-place and hide yourself."
I Samuel 23:3,"As for me, I will go out and stand next to my father in the field where you are;
I myself will speak about you to my father,
and whatever I see, I will tell you."
I Samuel 23:4,"So Yehonatan spoke of David for good to Sha’ul his father;
he said to him:
Let not the king sin against his servant, against David,
for he has not sinned against you,
for his deeds have been exceedingly to your good!"
I Samuel 23:5,"He took his life in his hands and struck down the Philistine,
and Y<small>HWH</small> wrought a great victory for all Israel
—you saw it and rejoiced.
So why would you sin against innocent blood
by causing David’s death for nothing?"
I Samuel 23:6,"Sha’ul hearkened to Yehonatan’s voice,
and Sha’ul swore:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, if he should be put to death … !"
I Samuel 23:7,"So Yehonatan called David,
and Yehonatan told him all these words.
Yehonatan brought David to Sha’ul,
and he was in his presence as yesterday [and] the day-before."
I Samuel 23:8,"The battles continued to take place;
David went out to wage battle against the Philistines,
and he struck them down, a great striking-down,
so that they fled before them."
I Samuel 23:9,"But an evil spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] upon Sha’ul:
he was sitting in his palace-house, his spear in his hand,
while David was strumming with his hand."
I Samuel 23:10,"And Sha’ul sought to strike, with the spear, David and the wall [together],
but he slipped away from Sha’ul,
so that he struck [only] the wall with his spear,
and David fled, and escaped on that night."
I Samuel 23:11,"Sha’ul sent messengers to David’s house, to watch out for him and to put him to death at daybreak,
but Mikhal, David’s wife, reported to him, saying:
If you don’t escape with your life tonight,
tomorrow you will be put to death!"
I Samuel 23:12,"So Mikhal let David down through the window;
he went off, got away, and escaped."
I Samuel 23:13,"Then Mikhal took the <i>terafim</i> and put it in the bed,
and a tangle of goats’-hair she put at its head,
and covered it with a garment."
I Samuel 23:14,"And when Sha’ul sent messengers to take David, she said:
He is sick."
I Samuel 23:15,"Then Sha’ul sent the messengers to see David, saying:
Bring him up in the bed to me, to put him to death!"
I Samuel 23:16,"But when the mesengers arrived,
here, the <i>terafim</i> were in the bed, with a tangle of goats’-hair at its head!"
I Samuel 23:17,"Sha’ul said to Mikhal:
Why have you deceived me thus?
You have sent my enemy free, so that he has escaped!
Mikhal said to Sha’ul:
He said to me: Send me free—
why should I cause your death?"
I Samuel 23:18,"Now David had gotten away and escaped, coming to Shemuel at Rama,
and had told him all that Sha’ul had done to him.
He went, he and Shemuel, and they stayed at Nayot."
I Samuel 23:19,"Now it was told to Sha’ul, saying:
Here, David is at Nayot in Rama!"
I Samuel 23:20,"So Sha’ul sent messengers to fetch David,
and they saw a group of prophets ranting-in-prophecy,
with Shemuel standing [there], stationed over them.
And there [came] upon Sha’ul’s messengers the spirit of God,
so that they ranted-like-prophets, they too."
I Samuel 23:21,"They told Sha’ul,
and he sent other messengers,
but they ranted-like-prophets, they too.
And Sha’ul again sent, a third [group of] messengers,
but they ranted-like-prophets, they too."
I Samuel 23:22,"So he went, he too, to Rama;
he arrived at the great cistern that is in Sekhu,
and made inquiry, and said:
Where are Shemuel and David?
They said:
Here, in Nayot in Rama."
I Samuel 23:23,"So he went there, to Nayot in Rama,
and there [came] upon him, him too, the spirit of God;
he went, going along and ranting-like-a-prophet, until he arrived at the shepherds’-camps in Rama.

Final Break; The Covenant of the Friends: In a last-ditch attempt to save his friend’s life, Yehonatan offers to intercede with Sha’ul. David proposes a simple test: if Sha’ul can accept David’s absence on a family matter, it will be a sign that he is once again in the king’s good graces, but if Sha’ul is unconvinced and agitated by the explanation given to him, the two friends will have to concede that there is no chance to mend the rift. The story makes use of an additional character through whom David and Yehonatan can communicate, an unsuspecting young servant who is sent to fetch arrows that Yehonatan shoots. Depending on the instructions given him, he is to (unwittingly) signal to David that all is either well or ill. Appropriately, the narrative echoes with repetitions of “good” and “evil,” referring to David’s fate.
The scene in which the prince sets out to determine his father’s attitude toward David (vv.27–33) is nicely constructed around the word “son.” David is referred to derisively (by omitting his given name), as the “son of Yishai”; Sha’ul insults Yehonatan by calling him the “son of a twisted rebellion”; and then Sha’ul pronounces the death sentence on his young rival by literally terming him a “son of death.”
The most significant repeating word in the story, however, is “know,” occurring nine times, which highlights a central concern in the text: David wishes to convince Yehonatan that there is no hope for any kind of reconciliation. That is, through the scenes of confrontation with Sha’ul, Yehonatan finally becomes convinced of what the audience “knew” all along. The story ends with a heartfelt covenant between the two young men, which is all the more ironic given that later events in the book will witness tension and death as the chief currencies between the House of David and the House of Sha’ul."
I Samuel 24:10,"And he stripped off, he too, his garments,
and ranted-like-a-prophet, he too, before Shemuel;
he fell down naked all that day and all night.
Therefore they say:
Is Sha’ul too among the prophets?"
I Samuel 25:1,"Now David had gotten away from Nayot in Rama;
he came and said before Yehonatan:
What have I done?
What is my iniquity, what is my sin before your father,
that he seeks my life?"
I Samuel 25:2,"He said to him:
[Heaven] forbid!
You will not die—
here, my father does not do anything great or anything small without baring my ear.
So for-what-reason should my father hide this matter from me?
This cannot [be]!"
I Samuel 25:3,"David swore again and said:
Your father knows, yes, knows
that I have found favor in your eyes,
so he has said [to himself]:
Yehonatan is not to know about this, lest he be pained;
but: by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, and by your life,
indeed, there is only something like a step between me and death!"
I Samuel 25:4,"Yehonatan said to David:
Whatever you yourself say, I will do for you."
I Samuel 25:5,"David said to Yehonatan:
Here, the New-Moon is tomorrow,
when I must sit, yes, sit beside the king to eat;
send me away, and I will hide in the open-field, until the third sunset."
I Samuel 25:6,"Now if your father takes account, yes, account of my [absence]
and you say: David requested, yes, requested-leave for himself from me to run back to Bet-Lehem his town,
for the yearly sacrificial-meal is there, for the entire clan—"
I Samuel 25:7,"if he says thus: Good!
it is well for your servant.
But if he is agitated, yes, agitated,
know that evil has been determined by him."
I Samuel 25:8,"So act with loyalty toward your servant,
for you brought your servant into Y<small>HWH</small>’s covenant with you.
Now if there be any iniquity in me,
put me to death yourself,
so to your father, why then should you bring me?"
I Samuel 25:9,"Yehonatan said:
[Heaven] forbid for you!
If I were to know, yes, know that evil is determined by my father to come against you,
would I not tell that to you?"
I Samuel 25:10,"David said to Yehonatan:
Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?"
I Samuel 25:11,"Yehonatan said to David:
Come, let us go out to the field.
The two of them went out to the field."
I Samuel 25:12,"And Yehonatan said to David:
By Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
when I have sounded out my father at this time tomorrow [or] the third [day],
and here: good is [determined] toward David,
shall I not then send to you and bare your ear?"
I Samuel 25:13,"Thus may Y<small>HWH</small> do to Yehonatan, and thus may he add:
if it seems good to my father, the evil [determined] against you,
I will bare your ear
and will send you away, that you may go in peace.
And may Y<small>HWH</small> be with you, as he was with my father!"
I Samuel 25:14,"Will you not, while I am still alive,
will you not deal with me in the loyalty of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so that I do not die?"
I Samuel 25:15,"You must not cut off your loyalty from my house, for the ages,
not even when Y<small>HWH</small> cuts off David’s enemies, each one from the face of the ground!"
I Samuel 25:16,"Yehonatan has cut [a covenant] with the House of David;
may Y<small>HWH</small> seek it from the hand of “David’s enemies”!"
I Samuel 25:17,"And Yehonatan swore to David again, by his love for him,
for he loved him with the love [he had] for his own self.
Then Yehonatan said to him:"
I Samuel 25:18,"Tomorrow is the New-Moon;
you will be counted-missing, for your seat will be counted-empty."
I Samuel 25:19,"When you are three-days-gone, go down exceedingly [quickly],
and when you come to the place where you were hiding at the time of the incident,
you are to sit near that stone."
I Samuel 25:20,"As for me, I will shoot three arrows to the side, to send them flying from me at a target."
I Samuel 25:21,"And here, I will send the serving-lad toward you, [saying]:
Go, find the arrows!
If I say, yes, say to the lad:
Here, the arrows are [to the side] of you, over there—
take them and come back, for it is well for you,
there is no problem, by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Samuel 25:22,"But if I say thus to the boy:
Here, the arrows are [to the side] of you, farther onward—go,
for Y<small>HWH</small> will have sent you away."
I Samuel 25:23,"And as for the promise that we have spoken, I and you,
here, Y<small>HWH</small> will be between me and you, for the ages!"
I Samuel 25:24,"So David hid in the open-field.
Now it was at the New-Moon, that the king sat by the food, to eat,"
I Samuel 25:25,"and the king sat in his seat as time and time [before],
in the seat by the wall.
Yehonatan was at-the-ffont, and Avner sat at the side of Sha’ul,
while David’s place was counted-empty."
I Samuel 25:26,"Now Sha’ul did not say anything on that day,
for he said [to himself]:
It is an accident;
he is not ritually-pure, for he has not been purified."
I Samuel 25:27,"But it was on the morrow of the New-Moon, on the second [day],
that David’s place was counted-empty.
So Sha’ul said to Yehonatan his son:
For-what-reason has the son of Yishai not come, even yesterday, even today, to the food?"
I Samuel 25:28,"Yehonatan answered Sha’ul:
David requested, yes, requested-leave for himself from me, to Bet- Lehem;"
I Samuel 25:29,"he said: Pray send me off,
for it is the sacrificial-meal of the clan for us in the town,
and my brother charged me.
So-now, if I have found favor in your eyes,
pray let me get away, that I may see my brothers.
Therefore he has not come to the king’s table."
I Samuel 25:30,"Sha’ul’s anger flared up against Yehonatan;
he said to him:
[You] son of a twisted rebellion!
Don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Yishai,
to your shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?"
I Samuel 25:31,"For all the days that the son of Yishai is alive on the earth,
you will not be firmly-established, you or your kingdom!
So-now,
send and fetch him to me,
for he is a son of death!"
I Samuel 25:32,"Yehonatan answered Sha’ul his father;
he said to him:
Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
I Samuel 25:33,"But Sha’ul hurled the spear at him, to strike him down,
and so Yehonatan knew
that his father had determined to put David to death."
I Samuel 25:34,"Yehonatan arose from the table in blazing anger;
he did not eat food on the second day of the New-Moon,
since he was pained about David,
since his father had humiliated him."
I Samuel 25:35,"So it was at daybreak,
that Yehonatan went out to the open-field to the appointment with David,
a young serving-lad with him."
I Samuel 25:36,"He said to his lad: Run, now find the arrows that I shoot!
As the lad ran, he shot an arrow past him,"
I Samuel 25:37,"and when the lad came to the place of the arrow that Yehonatan had shot,
Yehonatan called after the lad, he said:
Isn’t the arrow [to the side] of you, and farther onward?"
I Samuel 25:38,"And Yehonatan called after the lad:
Quick! Hurry! Don’t stand still!
So Yehonatan’s serving-lad collected the arrows and brought them to his lord."
I Samuel 25:39,"Now the lad knew nothing;
only Yehonatan and David knew about the matter."
I Samuel 25:40,"And Yehonatan gave his weapons to the lad that he had;
he said to him:
Go, bring [these back] to the town.

I Samuel 25:49,"<b>an accident … not ritually-pure:</b> The New Moon festival required ritual purity of its participants; if one had a bodily discharge of the “polluting” kind, for instance (see Lev. 12–15), one was temporarily excluded."
I Samuel 25:50,"<b>the morrow of the New-Moon:</b> See Fishbane for a discussion of this difficult phrase, which historically has raised ritual calendar questions among Jews in its appearance in Lev. 23:15’s “the morrow of the Sabbath.”"
I Samuel 25:51,"<b>get away:</b> Or “free to go” (McCarter 1980); the word, though, is most often found in contexts of survival, and so its use may be a bit ironic here. Fokkelman (1981) understands it as a Freudian slip which enrages Sha’ul."
I Samuel 25:52,"<b>[You] son of a twisted rebellion!:</b> Ehrlich points out that Sha’ul would not insult his lone wife as the “perverse, rebellious woman” found in most translations. Instead, he proposes that Yehonatan, in the eyes of Sha’ul, is advocating overthrowing his own father by allowing David to live—a “twisted” act. <b>the son of Yishai:</b> Once again, omitting a person’s given name is usually understood in the Bible as an insult."
I Samuel 25:53,"<b>firmly-established:</b> Or “secure.” <b>a son of death:</b> Or “a dead man.”
David at Nov and Gat: David the fugitive has two pressing needs, food and weapons, as he flees from Sha’ul. Arriving at Nov, his solitary presence arouses suspicions, but he is able to allay these through his cunning (note the recurrence of the related word “know” in v.3). We, of course, know that the “matter of the king” is no secret message, but rather refers to the fact that David is on the lam from Sha’ul. In any event, he is able to obtain bread and a sword—not just any weapon, but precisely the great sword of Golyat, which symbolically suggests David’s ability to prevail in the most difficult of circumstances.
Thus armed, David meets his third challenge of the chapter. He flees to the heart of enemy country, one of the Philistine towns, and is apparently recognized, exposing himself to immediate danger. In a final example of quick thinking, and perhaps an ironic reference to Sha’ul’s erstwhile ranting, he pretends to be crazy, dispelling the fears of the Philistines as to his identity."
I Samuel 25:54,"When the lad went off,
David arose from beside the mound,
flung himself on his nostrils to the ground, and bowed low three times,
and each one kissed his fellow,
each one wept with his fellow, until David [had wept] a great deal."
I Samuel 25:55,"Yehonatan said to David:
Go in peace,
[seeing] that the two of us, [even] we, have sworn in the name of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
May Y<small>HWH</small> be between me and you, between my seed and your seed, for the ages!"
I Samuel 26:1,"He arose and went away,
while Yehonatan came back to the town."
I Samuel 26:2,"David came to Nov, to Ahimelekh the priest.
And Ahimelekh trembled [coming] to meet David;
he said to him:
For-what-reason are you alone, and no one with you?"
I Samuel 26:3,"David said to Ahimelekh the priest:
The king has charged me with a matter,
he said to me:
No one is to know anything of the matter on which I am sending you, with which I have charged you!
And with the serving-lads I have made-appointment at such and so a place."
I Samuel 26:4,"So-now,
what do you have on hand?
Give five [rounds of] bread into my hand, or whatever is found."
I Samuel 26:5,"The priest answered David and said:
There is no ordinary bread on hand,
only hallowed bread is there—
provided that the lads have kept themselves away, of course, from women.

David in Flight; Sha’ul’s Revenge: From Gat, David moves southeast into the Judean hill-country. Here he becomes a kind of Robin Hood figure, attracting the disenfranchised (who are described as a class in other ancient Near Eastern texts) and serving as their chief. Sha’ul, meanwhile, vents his frustration on the priests of Nov, who are aghast to learn that the David to whom they gave food and weaponry in the previous chapter, and who had hitherto been a trusted key member of the royal household, is now accounted the king’s “ambusher” (v.13). Sha’ul’s command to kill the priests is resisted by his servants, but as so often in literature and in life, a volunteer comes forward, in this case Do’eg the Edomite. And, true to type, there is a survivor, Evyatar, who finds secure refuge with David. Together with his son, he will later become one of David’s priests (II Sam. 8:17, 20:25)."
I Samuel 26:9,"David answered the priest;
he said to him:
Certainly women have been held back from us, so yesterday [and] the day-before;
whenever I went out, the lads’ gear was hallowed, even [if it was] an ordinary journey—
how much more so today the gear should be hallowed!"
I Samuel 26:10,"So the priest gave him hallowed [bread],
for there was no bread there except for the Bread of the Presence that was removed from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
for [them] to put warm bread [there] at the time of its being taken away."
I Samuel 26:11,"Now a man was there from the servants of Sha’ul that day,
held-in-custody in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
his name was Do’eg the Edomite,
chief of the shepherds that belonged to Sha’ul."
I Samuel 26:12,"David said to Ahimelekh:
Don’t you have on hand here a spear or a sword?
For neither my sword nor my weapons did I take along in my hand,
for the matter of the king was urgent!"
I Samuel 26:13,"The priest said:
The sword of Golyat the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of the Oak—
here it is, wrapped up in a cloth, behind the <i>efod.</i>
If it is what you wish to take for yourself, take it,
for there is no other one besides it in this [place].
David said: There is none like it—give it to me!"
I Samuel 26:14,"And David arose
and got away on that day from before Sha’ul,
and came to Akhish king of Gat."
I Samuel 26:15,"Now the servants of Akhish said to him:
Isn’t this David, the king of the land?
Isn’t it about this one that they chant in [their] dances, saying:
Sha’ul has struck down his thousands,
but David—his myriads!?"
I Samuel 26:16,"David took these words to heart, and was exceedingly afraid in the presence of Akhish king of Gat,"
I Samuel 26:17,"so he altered his demeanor in their eyes
and acted deranged [while] in their hands:
he drummed on the doors of the gate
and let his spittle run down his beard."
I Samuel 26:18,"And Akhish said to his servants:
Here, look at this one acting-like-a-madman!
Why do you bring him to me?"
I Samuel 26:19,"Do I lack madmen
that you have brought this one to act-like-a-madman around me?
Should this one come into my house?"
I Samuel 27:1,"David went from there and escaped to the Cave of Adullam.
His brothers and his whole Father’s House heard,
and they went down to him there."
I Samuel 27:2,"And there gathered to him every man in straits, every man who had a creditor, and every man of bitter feelings,
and he became commander over them.
And there were with him about four hundred men."
I Samuel 27:3,"David went from there to Mitzpe / Lookout of Moav;
he said to the king of Moav:
Pray let my father and my mother stay with you
until I know what God [intends to] do with me."
I Samuel 27:4,"So he led them into the presence of the king of Moav, and they stayed with him, all the days of David’s being at the stronghold."
I Samuel 27:5,"But the prophet Gad said to David:
You are not to stay at the stronghold;
go, come on your [way] to the land of Judah.
So David went and came to the Forest of Heret."
I Samuel 27:6,"And Sha’ul heard that [the whereabouts of] David were known, and of the men that were with him.
Now Sha’ul was staying at Giv’a, under a tamarisk at Rama, with his spear in his hand,
and all his servants were standing-in-attendance around him."
I Samuel 27:7,"Sha’ul said to his servants who were standing around him:
Now hearken, O Binyaminites:
Is it really to all of you that the son of Yishai will give fields and vineyards?
Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,"
I Samuel 27:8,"that all of you have banded together against me?
No one bares my ear when my son cuts [a covenant] with the son of Yishai;
none of you is concerned about me or bares my ear
[to reveal] that my son has raised up my servant against me as an ambusher, as is this day!"
I Samuel 27:9,"Then Do’eg the Edomite spoke up
—he was standing around the servants of Sha’ul—
and said:
I saw the son of Yishai come to Nov, to Ahimelekh son of Ahituv;"
I Samuel 27:10,"he inquired for him of Y<small>HWH</small>, and provisions he gave him,

David Holds Back from Killing Sha’ul II: An alternative tradition to the one in Chap. 24 is more expansive. It is marked by multiple conversations (between David and Avishai, David and Avner, and Sha’ul and David) and more psychological detail. David’s actions here are also more risk-filled than they were in Chap. 24, with Sha’ul’s generals and soldiers immediately present, yet he is also clearly protected by YHWH (see v.12). The motif word “hand” returns (vv.8, 9, 11, 18, 23) to link the two accounts. Of greatest interest is the verbal connection with the Naval story of the previous chapter: David has learned his lesson—YHWH will “smite” Sha’ul, either naturally or in battle (v.10), just as he “smote” Naval in 25:38, and David will not have to bear either the guilt or the political consequences.
The abiding question is whether David acts here out of true piety and regard for the “divine right of kings” or whether he is simply politically astute. The text leaves it for the reader to decide (for a strong vote for the former, see Borgman; most recent commentators are highly skeptical of David’s motives)."
I Samuel 28:6,"David took from her hand what she had brought him,
and to her he said:
Go up in peace to your house;
see,
I have hearkened to your voice, and have lifted up your face!"
I Samuel 28:7,"Avigayil went back to Naval,
and here, he was having a drinkfest in his house, like a king’s drinkfest.
Now Naval’s heart was in good-humor upon him—he was drunk to excess—
so she did not tell him a thing, small or great, until the light of daybreak."
I Samuel 28:8,"But it was at daybreak,
when the wine was going out of Naval,
that his wife told those things to him,
and his heart died within him, and he himself became [like] a stone."
I Samuel 28:9,"It was about ten days [later]
that Y<small>HWH</small> attacked Naval, so that he died."
I Samuel 28:10,"David heard that Naval was dead,
and he said:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>,
who has upheld my cause at having been mocked at the hand of Naval,
and his servant he has held back from evildoing!
And as for the evildoing of Naval, Y<small>HWH</small> has returned it on his head.
David sent and spoke for Avigayil, to take her as a wife for him;"
I Samuel 28:11,"David’s servants came to Avigayil, to Carmel,
and spoke to her, saying:
David has sent us to you, to take you as a wife for him."
I Samuel 28:12,"She proceeded to bow down, nostrils to the ground,
and said:
Here, your maidservant is a handmaid to wash the feet of my lord’s servants!"
I Samuel 28:13,"Avigayil quickly arose and mounted a donkey, with five of her girls who went behind her;
she went after David’s messengers,
and she became a wife for him."
I Samuel 28:14,"Now Ahinoam [too] David had taken, from Yizre’el,
and the two of them alike became wives for him;"
I Samuel 28:15,"for Sha’ul had given Mikhal his daughter, David’s wife,
to Palti son of Layish, who was from Gallim."
I Samuel 29:1,"Some Zifites came to Sha’ul at Giv’a, saying:
Is not David hiding himself at the Hill of Hakhila, facing the wasteland?"
I Samuel 29:2,"So Sha’ul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Zif,
and with him were three thousand men, hand-picked ones of Israel,
to seek out David in the Wilderness of Zif."
I Samuel 29:3,"Sha’ul encamped at the Hill of Hakhila, which faces the wasteland, along the road,
while David was staying in the wilderness;
and he saw that Sha’ul had come after him into the wilderness,"
I Samuel 29:4,"so David sent spies, that he might know that Sha’ul had come for certain."
I Samuel 29:5,"Then David arose and came to the place where Sha’ul was encamped;
David saw the place where Sha’ul was lying, along with Avner son of Ner, the commander of his forces,
with Sha’ul lying in the wagon-ring, and all the fighting-people encamped around him."
I Samuel 29:6,"And David spoke up, he said to Ahimelekh the Hittite and to Avishai son of Tzeruya, Yoav’s brother, saying:
Who will go down with me to Sha’ul, to the camp?
Avishai said:
I will go down with you!"
I Samuel 29:7,"So David and Avishai went to the fighting-people at nighttime,
and here, Sha’ul was lying asleep in the wagon-ring,
with his spear stuck into the ground at his head
and Avner and the fighting-people lying around him."
I Samuel 29:8,"Avishai said to David:
God has turned over your enemy today into your hand!
So-now, just let me strike him with the spear into the ground one time;
I will not [have to do it] twice to him!"
I Samuel 29:9,"But David said to Avishai:
You are not to bring him to ruin!
For who could stretch out his hand against Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one and be cleared?"
I Samuel 29:10,"And David said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
rather, Y<small>HWH</small> will attack him:
either his day will come, and he will die,
or into battle he will go down and be swept away!"
I Samuel 29:11,"[Heaven] forbid for me, by Y<small>HWH</small>,

I Samuel 29:14,"and David called out to the fighting-people and to Avner son of Ner, saying:
Won’t you answer, Avner?
Avner answered and said:
Who are you, [that] you call to the king?"
I Samuel 29:15,"David said to Avner:
Aren’t you a man?
And who is like you in Israel?
So why haven’t you kept watch over your lord king?
For one of the fighting-people came to bring ruin to the king your lord!"
I Samuel 29:16,"No good is this thing that you have done!
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
indeed, you are sons of death,

Why now does my lord pursue after his servant?
Indeed, what have I done?
And what evil is there in my hand?"

if it is Y<small>HWH</small> [who] incited you against me, let him savor a gift- offering;
but if it was by humans,
then let them be doomed before Y<small>HWH</small>,

saying:
Go, serve other gods!"
I Samuel 29:20,"So-now,
let not my blood fall to the earth, away from the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>!
For the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea,
as one pursues a partridge in the hills!"
I Samuel 29:21,"Sha’ul said:
I have sinned; return, my son David!
For I will do evil to you no more,
since my life was precious in your eyes this day.
Here, I have acted-foolishly and have been in exceedingly great error!"
I Samuel 29:22,"David answered and said:
Here is the king’s spear;
let one of the serving-lads cross over and fetch it,"
I Samuel 29:23,"and may Y<small>HWH</small> return upon each one his righteousness and his trustworthiness,

Blessed are you, my son David;
you will do, yes, do [well],
and you will prevail, yes, prevail!

David as Mercenary: In what feels like an unlikely turn, David, at last freed from pursuit by Sha’ul (v.4), distances himself from his Israelite compatriots by becoming a vassal of the enemy (Philistine) king, Akhish of Gat. In his desire to secure the king’s trust, he exercises ruthlessness toward captured populations, cleverly intimating that these include his fellow Judeans. The scenario is reminiscent of typical undercover stories."
I Samuel 30:1,"David said in his heart:
Now
I will be swept away one day by the hand of Sha’ul;
there is nothing better for me than that I should escape, yes, escape to the land of the Philistines—
then Sha’ul will despair of me, of seeking me again throughout all the territory of Israel,
and I will escape from his hand."

Sha’ul and Shemuel at En Dor: Of all the dramatic moments in Sha’ul’s life—and there are many—nothing quite matches the eerie mood of this brief story, which takes place at night and involves the spirit of a dead man. It feels as if it might have been the inspiration for moments in Hamlet or Macbeth. In its devastating finality, it comprises the emotional end of the Sha’ul narratives. The account of the king’s actual death, which is reported in Chap. 31, only reports the inevitable.
The story expands on the theme of God’s abandonment of Sha’ul, opening with a reminder that Shemuel is gone (see 25:1) and the observation that all of the conventional means by which a king might divine God’s will have proved futile (v.6). Sha’ul, who for once had followed God’s law in v.2, now must break it in secret, out of desperation. In order to do so, he must circumvent the Philistine lines, disguised in “other garments” (ironically echoing his transformation into “another man” with “another heart” when he was anointed as king in 10:6 and 9), thus concealing his identity from the medium.
The consulting of spirits to learn the future was a well-known practice in the premodern world, but its appearance here is unique in the Hebrew Bible. While raising the dead and other aspects of sorcery were banned in the Bible, they were not viewed as ineffective; nevertheless, the text passes over any description of exactly how the woman works her magic and goes right to the unorthodox meeting between the two old friends. As usual, it is the face-to-face confrontation that interests the Bible rather than the background details, and so we must do without the dramatic lighting, special effects, and sinister music that would mark the presentation of such a scene in today’s media.
A number of enigmatic points emerge in this narrative. First, how does Sha’ul know from the woman’s laconic description of the ghost that it is indeed that of the old prophet? “An old man … wrapped in a cloak” would seem to reveal little in the way of identity. But we may recall that it was Shemuel’s cloak that was the physical focal point of Sha’ul’s rejection as king (15:27), as the ghost implies with its reuse of “torn” in v.17. Second, there is Shemuel’s tantalizing suggestion about the nature of the Underworld in v.15, “Why have you disturbed me?” This tells us only that, in the biblical view, our state after death is akin to rest or sleep, and does not involve the elaborate construction of Heaven and Hell with which we are so familiar in the Western world. Finally, Shemuel’s reply to the “distressed” king does not address the question asked of him until he has rehashed God’s rejection of Sha’ul. His answer, in v.19, contains one of the most chilling lines in the Bible. The text could simply have said, “Tomorrow, you and your sons will die,” but instead intones the memorable “tomorrow, you and your sons are with me.”
What could have been the story’s ending is striking enough: Sha’ul does not merely collapse, an understandable reaction to the bad news he has just received; he falls “his full stature to the ground” (v.20), providing a purposeful contrast to one of the reasons Sha’ul had been chosen king in the first place. We recall that initially he had been described as “taller than all the people” (9:2), and had been rejected with the words “Do not look at … the tallness of his stature” (16:7). Sha’ul has farther to fall than most.
It is at this point in the story, in a narrative that has already provided some surprises, that the unexpected happens again. If the Bible’s purpose had been solely to portray Sha’ul as a villain, he might simply have slunk back to the Israelite camp and wept, or experienced a night of uneasy dreams in the manner of Shakespeare’s Richard III. Instead, both king and reader are given a compassionate moment of respite. Literature abounds in less than reputable characters who demonstrate their humanity (see, for instance, Rahav, the classic “good-hearted prostitute” of Josh. 2). In this case, it is the medium who acts as a kind of stand-in for God, offering the stricken king nourishment and thus confirming his humanity. Moving from ground to bed (v.23), Sha’ul for the moment staves off his death and, instead of receiving the promised “bit of bread” (v.22), is given a more substantial meal, as befits a king. Thus the Sha’ul who exits his shattering meeting with the dead Shemuel is fortified for his heroic ordeal of the next day, when he will die leading the troops one last time against Israel’s enemies. From the beginning of the story, where the king had denied both his identity and his values as upholder of divine law, he emerges at the end, thanks to the medium’s act, as ruler and commander in chief, prepared to die if necessary at the head of “Y<small>HWH</small>’s armies” (see Simon 1997)."
I Samuel 30:11,"And David would strike the land;
he would leave alive no man or woman,
but he would take sheep and oxen, donkeys and camels and garments,
and then he would return and come back to Akhish."
I Samuel 30:12,"And Akhish would say:
On [whom] did you sweep down today?
And David would say:
Against the Negev of Judah,
or: against the Negev of the Yerahme’elites,
or: against the Negev of the Kenites."
I Samuel 30:13,"But no man or woman would David leave alive to bring to Gat, saying:
Lest they report concerning us, saying:
Thus did David do
and thus was his practice,
all the days that he stayed in Philistine country."
I Samuel 30:14,"So Akhish came-to-trust David, saying:
He has made himself reek, yes, reek so to his own people, to Israel,
so he will be servant to me for a lifetime!"
I Samuel 31:1,"It was in those days
that the Philistines gathered their camps into an armed-force, to wage battle against Israel.
Akhish said to David:
You know, yes, know that you must go out with me in the camp, you and your men."
I Samuel 31:2,"David said to Akhish:
Then you yourself will know what your servant can do!
So Akhish said to David:
Then I will make you my chief bodyguard for all the days [to come]!"
I Samuel 31:3,"Now Shemuel had died,
and all Israel had beaten [the breast] for him and had buried him in Rama, in his town.
Now Sha’ul had removed [those inquiring of] ghosts and all- knowing ones from the land."
I Samuel 31:4,"And the Philistines gathered and came, encamping at Shunem,
while Sha’ul gathered all Israel, encamping at Gilboa."
I Samuel 31:5,"Sha’ul saw the Philistines’ camp
and he became afraid, and his heart trembled exceedingly."
I Samuel 31:6,"So Sha’ul made request of Y<small>HWH</small>,
but Y<small>HWH</small> did not answer him,
either through dreams, or through <i>Urim,</i> or through prophets."
I Samuel 31:7,"So Sha’ul said to his servants:
Seek for me a woman, a possessor of ghosts,
that I may go to her, that I may inquire of [the dead] through her.
His servants said to him:
There is a woman, a possessor of ghosts at En Dor."
I Samuel 31:8,"Sha’ul disguised himself and clothed himself in other garments,
and he went, he and two men with him,
and came to the woman at night.
He said:
Now divine for me by a ghost;
bring up for me the one whom I will designate to you."
I Samuel 31:9,"The woman said to him:
Here, <i>you</i> know what Sha’ul has done,
how he has cut off [those inquiring of] ghosts and all-knowing ones from the land.
So why would you ensnare my life, to cause my death?"
I Samuel 31:10,"Sha’ul swore to her by Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, should any guilt befall you through this matter … !"
I Samuel 31:11,"The woman said:
Whom shall I bring up for you?
He said:
Bring up Shemuel for me."
I Samuel 31:12,"The woman saw Shemuel,
and she cried out in a loud voice;
the woman said to Sha’ul, saying:
Why have you deceived me? For you are Sha’ul!"
I Samuel 31:13,"The king said to her:
Do not be afraid;
rather, what do you see?
The woman said to Sha’ul:
I see a godlike-being coming up from the ground."
I Samuel 31:14,"He said to her:
What is its form?
She said:
An old man is coming up,
and he is wrapped in a cloak.
Then Sha’ul knew that it was Shemuel,
and he prostrated himself, nostrils to the earth, and bowed low."
I Samuel 31:15,"Shemuel said to Sha’ul:
Why have you disturbed me, by bringing me up?
Sha’ul said:
I am exceedingly distressed—
the Philistines are waging battle against me
and God has turned away from me:
he no longer answers me,
either through the hand of the prophets or through dreams.
So I have called you to make known to me what I should do!"
I Samuel 31:16,"Shemuel said:
But why do you make request of me?
For Y<small>HWH</small> has turned away from you and has become your foe!"
I Samuel 31:17,"Y<small>HWH</small> has done to you as he promised through my hand:
Y<small>HWH</small> has torn away the kingdom from your hand
and has given it to your fellow, to David"
I Samuel 31:18,"—as you did not hearken to Y<small>HWH</small>’s voice,
and did not carry out his blazing anger against Amalek.
Therefore this thing has Y<small>HWH</small> done to you this day!"
I Samuel 31:19,"And Y<small>HWH</small> will also give Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines;
tomorrow, you and your sons are with me;
also the camp of Israel Y<small>HWH</small> will give into the hand of the Philistines!"
I Samuel 31:20,"Sha’ul quickly fell his full stature to the ground;
he was exceedingly afraid at Shemuel’s words,
also there was no strength in him,
for he had not eaten food all day and all night."
I Samuel 31:21,"The woman came to Sha’ul,
and she saw that he was exceedingly terrified,
so she said to him:
Here, your handmaid hearkened to your voice,
and I put my life in my hand—
I hearkened to your words which you spoke to me."
I Samuel 31:22,"So-then,
now hearken, you also, to your handmaid’s voice:
I will put before you a bit of bread—eat,
so that there may be strength in you when you go on your way."
I Samuel 31:23,"He refused, and said: I will not eat!
But his servants pressed him, and also the woman,
so he hearkened to their voice;
he arose from the ground and sat down on the couch."
I Samuel 31:24,"Now the woman had a stall-fed calf in the house;
she hurried and slew it,
took meal and kneaded it, and baked it into unleavened-cakes."
I Samuel 31:25,"Then she brought it close before Sha’ul and before his servants, and they ate,
and they arose and went away, that [very] night.

Philistine Suspicions About David: As the Philistines prepare for battle against the Israelites, David accompanies them, but his loyalty is immediately questioned, despite all his efforts to prove himself in Chap. 27. The Philistine overlords are rightly concerned about the possibility that David, their former tormentor, will return to his roots and go over to the Israelite side. King Akhish is forced to reluctantly order David to head back to Philistia, forbidding him to participate in the coming battle against Sha’ul. Once again, as so often, David will be absent when his enemies are done away with."
I Samuel 32:1,"The Philistines gathered all their encampments at Afek,
while Israel was encamped at the spring that is in Yizre’el."
I Samuel 32:2,"Now the Philistine overlords were crossing over by [divisions of] hundreds and by [divisions of] thousands,
with David and his men crossing over in the rear, beside Akhish."
I Samuel 32:3,"The Philistine commanders said:
What [about] these Hebrews?
Akhish said to the Philistine commanders:
Is this not David, servant of Sha’ul king of Israel,
who has been with me for these days and these years,
yet I have found nothing [amiss] in him, from the day of his falling in [with us] until this day?"
I Samuel 32:4,"The Philistine commanders became furious with him,
and the Philistine commanders said to him:
Return the man, and let him return to his place which you assigned him,
but do not let him go down with us into battle,
so that he will not be an adversary to us in battle!
For whereby will this one make himself acceptable [again] to his lord—
is it not with the heads of those men?"
I Samuel 32:5,"Is this not David,
about whom they chanted with dancing, saying: Sha’ul has struck down his thousands, but David—his myriads?"
I Samuel 32:6,"So Akhish had David called
and said to him:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
indeed, you are upright,
and good in my eyes is your going out and your coming in with me in the camp,
for I have not found any evil in you from the day of your coming to me until this day—
but in the eyes of the Philistine overlords you are not good!

I Samuel 33:1,<b>Afek:</b> See note to 4: above. <b>Yizre’el:</b> The fertile Jezreel Valley of northern Israel.
I Samuel 33:2,"<b>the heads of those men:</b> A JPS note understands this expression as euphemistic for “our heads,” with “those men” indicating the Philistines."
I Samuel 33:3,"<b>By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The Philistines, of course, were not worshippers of Y<small>HWH</small>, but the expression here is a standard biblical one—or else Akhish is showing special sensitivity to David.
David as Rescuer: In the course of his journey away from direct confrontation in battle with Sha’ul, David discovers that the Philistine-occupied town of Tziklag has been devastated, and all its women, including his own wives Ahinoam and Avigayil, have been taken captive. A chance encounter with an Egyptian man reveals that the raiders were Amalekites, and David is subsequently able to crush them as they revel among the spoils.
The story appears to have several functions. It puts David in a similar light to the patriarch Avraham, who had rescued his nephew and family from wartime captivity (see Gen. 14); it provides a contrast to Sha’ul, who had previously failed in his battle dealings with the Amalekites (Chap. 15); it links David to a current (in the writer’s time) practice of parceling out spoils even to parts of the army that have not participated in the battle proper; and, in the final verses, it gives David a means through which to eventually win back the good graces of his fellow Judeans.
As Fokkelman (1993) has carefully worked out, timewise the action of this chapter is simultaneous to Sha’ul’s defeat in the next one. Thus, David’s victory fittingly coincides with Sha’ul’s end."
I Samuel 33:4,"So-now,
turn back, and go in peace,
so that you do not do evil in the eyes of the Philistine overlords."
I Samuel 33:5,"David said to Akhish:
Indeed, what have I done;
what have you found in your servant
from the day that I was [first] before you, until this day,
that I may not come and wage battle against the enemies of my lord king?"
I Samuel 33:6,"Akhish answered and said to David:
I acknowledge that you are as good in my eyes as a messenger of a god;
however, the Philistine commanders say:
He must not go up with us into battle!"
I Samuel 33:7,"So-now, start-early at daybreak,
and as for your lord’s servants who came with you,
you are [all] to start-early at daybreak;

I Samuel 33:8,"So David started-early, he and his men, to go at daybreak, to return to the land of the Philistines,

I Samuel 34:1,"It was, when David came and his men to Tziklag, on the third day
—now Amalekites had swept down on the Negev, on Tziklag;
they had struck Tziklag, and burned it with fire,"
I Samuel 34:2,"and they had taken captive the women that were in it, from young to old.
They had not put any [of them] to death,
but had led them away and gone on their way—"
I Samuel 34:3,"David and his men came to the town,
and here, it was burned down with fire,
with their wives and their sons and their daughters taken captive!"
I Samuel 34:4,"And David and the fighting-people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept
until there was no strength in them to weep."
I Samuel 34:5,"Now David’s two wives had been taken captive,
Ahinoam the Yizre’elite and Avigayil wife of Naval the Carmelite."
I Samuel 34:6,"And David was exceedingly distressed,

I Samuel 34:7,"David said to Evyatar the priest, son of Ahimelekh:
Now bring the <i>efod</i> close to me!
Evyatar brought the <i>efod</i> close to David."
I Samuel 34:8,"And David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Shall I pursue after this raiding-band?
Will I overtake them?
He said to him:
Pursue,
for you will overtake, yes, overtake, and will rescue, yes, rescue [them]!"
I Samuel 34:9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him,
and they came to Wadi Besor, while those left stayed behind."
I Samuel 34:10,"And David gave pursuit, he and four hundred men,
while two hundred men stayed behind, who were [too] exhausted to cross Wadi Besor."
I Samuel 34:11,"They found an Egyptian man in the open-field, and took him to David;
they gave him bread and he ate, and they had him drink water,"
I Samuel 34:12,"and they gave him a slice of pressed-figs and two raisin-bunches, and he ate.
Then his spirit returned to him
—for he had not eaten bread and had not drunk water for three days and three nights."
I Samuel 34:13,"And David said to him:
To whom do you [belong]? And where are you from?
He said:
I am an Egyptian serving-lad, the servant of an Amalekite man;
my lord abandoned me, since I became sick three days ago."
I Samuel 34:14,"We were sweeping down on the Negev of the Kereitites,
against what belongs to Judah,
and against the Negev of Calev,

I Samuel 34:15,"David said to him:
Will you bring me down to this band?
He said:
Swear to me by God

Then I will bring you down to this band."
I Samuel 34:16,"He brought him down,
and here, they were stretched out all over the surface of the ground,
eating and drinking and celebrating
among all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah."
I Samuel 34:17,"And David struck them from the [dawn] breeze until the morrow’s sunset;
not one of them escaped except for four hundred serving-lads who mounted camels and fled."

The Death of Sha’ul: The final episode in Sha’ul’s tragedy, stunningly portrayed in Pieter Brueghel’s famous large painting, is reported in a chapter of great compactness. The battle scene itself is typically brief; what interests the writer is only the outcome—the death of the king and his sons.
Sha’ul dies heroically. His decision to commit suicide stems not from depression or despair but from the desire to die with dignity and escape the humiliation which he fears would be his lot if the Philistines were to find him alive. As it is, his corpse is mutilated, with armor and torso taken as trophies for Philistine sites. In the end, however, the body and those of his sons are rescued by the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad, the very ones whom Sha’ul had saved from the Ammonites at the beginning of his career, and given proper burial.
At the same time as Sha’ul dies heroically, there is a sobering note. His suicide in battle recalls the death of a previous king, actually a usurper, Avimelekh, in Judg. 9. As with other foreshadowings of the reign of Sha’ul (see Judg. 19), the parallel does not do him honor."
I Samuel 34:26,"but every evil and base man of the men who had gone with David spoke up
and said:
Because they did not go with me,
we will not give them any of the spoils that we rescued

I Samuel 35:3,"The battle was heavy around Sha’ul;
the shooters, the men of the bow, found him,
and he was seriously wounded by the shooters."
I Samuel 35:4,"So Sha’ul said to his weapons bearer:
Draw your sword and run me through with it,
lest these Foreskinned Ones come and run me through and deal wantonly with me!
But the weapons bearer would not, because he was exceedingly afraid,
so Sha’ul took the sword and fell on it."
I Samuel 35:5,"And his weapons bearer saw that Sha’ul was dead,
so he too fell on his sword, and died with him."
I Samuel 35:6,"Thus died Sha’ul, and his three sons and his weapons bearer,
indeed, all his men, on that day, together."
I Samuel 35:7,"The men of Israel saw, those across the Valley and those across the Jordan,
that the [other] men of Israel had fled,

so they abandoned the towns and fled,
and Philistines came and settled in them."
I Samuel 35:8,"Now it was on the morrow,
that the Philistines came to strip the slain,
and they found Sha’ul and his three sons, fallen on Mount Gilboa."
I Samuel 35:9,"They cut off his head and stripped off his armor,
and sent [word] throughout the land of the Philistines, all around,
to bring-the-news into the house of their carved-idols and among the people."

and his corpse they thrust into the wall of Bet-She’an."
I Samuel 35:11,"But the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad heard
about what the Philistines had done to Sha’ul,"
I Samuel 35:12,"so all the men of valor arose and went all night
and took down Sha’ul’s corpse and the corpses of his sons from the wall of Bet-Shan,
and brought them to Yavesh, and burned them there;"
I Samuel 35:13,"then they took their bones and buried them beneath the tamarisk in Yavesh,
and fasted for seven days.
