<p><italic>Appendix: Support for the Sanctuary</italic> (27): Clearly a later addition to Leviticus, Chap. 27 provides for the upkeep of the sanctuary through a variety of means: donations of silver; pledging animals or property which is later redeemed for silver; confiscated property; and tithes. The nature of the text as appendix is obvious, given the finality of tone in the previous chapter, but it could also be said that 27 provides an appropriate ending to Leviticus, since it talks about dedication of property to God, as the book does in regard to all areas of life.</p>
