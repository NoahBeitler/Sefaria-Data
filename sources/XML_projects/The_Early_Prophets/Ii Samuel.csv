Ii Samuel 1:1,"It was after the death of Sha’ul
—David had returned from striking the Amalek[ites]—
that David stayed in Tziklag for two days."
Ii Samuel 1:2,"And it was on the third day,
that here, a man was coming from the camp, from Sha’ul,
with his garments torn and earth on his head;
and it was, when he came to David, that he flung himself on the ground and bowed low."
Ii Samuel 1:3,"David said to him:
Where are you coming from?
He said to him:
From the camp of Israel have I escaped!"
Ii Samuel 1:4,"David said to him:
How did the matter go? Now tell me!
He said:
[It was] that the fighting-people fled from the battle,
and also many fell of the fighting-people, and they died;
and also Sha’ul and Yehonatan his son died."
Ii Samuel 1:5,"David said to the lad, the one telling him:
How do you know that Sha’ul and Yehonatan his son are dead?"
Ii Samuel 1:6,"The lad, the one telling him, said:
I chanced, yes, chanced upon Mount Gilboa,
and here, Sha’ul was leaning on his spear,
and here, the charioteers and the horsemen were pressing-him-hard."
Ii Samuel 1:7,"He faced about behind him and saw me;
he called out to me,
and I said: Here I am."
Ii Samuel 1:8,"He said to me:
Who are you?
I said to him:
I am an Amalekite."
Ii Samuel 1:9,"He said to me:
Now stand over me and dispatch me,
for dizziness has come upon me,
though there is still life in me!"
Ii Samuel 1:10,"So I stood over him and dispatched him,
since I knew that he could not live after his having fallen;
then I took the diadem that was on his head
and the bracelet that was on his arm,
and have brought them to my lord here."
Ii Samuel 1:11,"David took hold of his clothes and tore them,
and likewise all the men that were with him;"
Ii Samuel 1:12,"they beat [the breast] and wept and fasted until sunset
over Sha’ul and over Yehonatan his son,
over the fighting-people of Y<small>HWH</small> and over the House of Israel,
since they had fallen by the sword."
Ii Samuel 1:13,"Then David said to the lad, the one telling him:
Where are you from?
He said:
I am the son of a sojourner man, an Amalekite."
Ii Samuel 1:14,"David said to him:
How were you not afraid
to stretch out your hand to bring Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one to ruin?"
Ii Samuel 1:15,"And David called to one of the serving-lads
and said:
Approach, attack him!
And he struck him down, so that he died."
Ii Samuel 1:16,"David said to him:
Your blood be on your head!
For your mouth bore witness against you, saying:
I myself dispatched Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one!"
Ii Samuel 1:17,"Now David sang-dirge with this dirge
over Sha’ul and over Yehonatan his son,"
Ii Samuel 1:18,"he said:
To teach the Children of Judah the bow,
here, it is written in the Record of the Upright:"
Ii Samuel 1:19,"O beauty of Israel, on your heights are the slain:
how have the mighty fallen!"
Ii Samuel 1:20,"Tell it not in Gat,
spread not the news in Ashkelon’s streets,
lest they rejoice, the daughters of the Philistines,
lest they exult, the daughters of the Foreskinned Ones!"
Ii Samuel 1:21,"O hills of Gilboa, let there be no dew, no rain upon you,
or surging of the [watery] deeps,
for there lies-soiled the shield of the mighty, the shield of Sha’ul,
no more anointed with oil."
Ii Samuel 1:22,"From the blood of the slain, from the sword of the mighty,
Yehonatan’s bow never turned back, Sha’ul’s sword never returned empty."
Ii Samuel 1:23,"Sha’ul and Yehonatan, those beloved and delightful ones—
in their lives and in their deaths they were not parted;
they were swifter than eagles, they were mightier than lions!"
Ii Samuel 1:24,"O daughters of Israel, weep over Sha’ul,
who clothed you in scarlet together with luxuries,
who with golden ornaments decked your apparel!"
Ii Samuel 1:25,"How have the mighty fallen, in the midst of battle,
Yehonatan slain on your heights—"
Ii Samuel 1:26,"I am distraught over you, my brother Yehonatan,
you were very delightful to me;
more wonderful was your love to me
than the love of women!"
Ii Samuel 1:27,"How have the mighty fallen,
yes, perished the weapons of battle!"
Ii Samuel 2:1,"It was [some time] after this
that David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Shall I go up into one of the towns of Judah?
Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Go up!
David said:
To where shall I go up?
He said:
To Hevron."
Ii Samuel 2:2,"So David went up there,
and also his two wives,
Ahinoam the Yizre’elite, and Avigayil the wife of Naval the Carmelite."
Ii Samuel 2:3,"As for his men who were with him, David brought them up, each one and his household,
and they settled in the towns of Hevron."
Ii Samuel 2:4,"And the men of Judah came and anointed David there as king over the House of Judah ….
They told David, saying:
The men of Yavesh-Gil’ad have buried Sha’ul."
Ii Samuel 2:5,"So David sent messengers to the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad;
he said to them:
Blessed are you of Y<small>HWH</small>,
in that you did this act-of-loyalty to your lord, to Sha’ul,
by burying him!"
Ii Samuel 2:6,"So-now,
may God show you loyalty and faithfulness,
and I too will do this act-of-good to you,
in exchange for your having done this thing!"
Ii Samuel 2:7,"And now,
let your hands be strengthened
and be valiant ones,
for your lord Sha’ul is dead,
and already it is I [whom] the House of Judah has anointed as king over them.
to David, led by Yoav, and the partisans of Sha’ul, led by Avner. In the process, the conflict gets personal, as Yoav’s brother is unavoidably slain by Avner, who then manages to obtain a cease-fire in the interests of preventing further bloodshed and civil war. But in a world often marked by blood vengeance, it is most unlikely that matters will stand the way they are.
The narrative is marked by an unusual echoing word: “after.” It resounds with both spatial and abstract meanings, fourteen times in twelve verses (19–30), and expresses well the concept of pursuit that is so central to the story. In the end, Avner’s “Do you not know that it will be bitter <i>afterward</i>?” (v.26; italics mine) summarizes the need to resolve the civil war."
Ii Samuel 2:8,"But Avner son of Ner, commander of the armed-forces that belonged to Sha’ul,
had taken Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul, and had had him cross over to Mahanayim;"
Ii Samuel 2:9,"he had made him king over Gil’ad, over the Geshurites, and over Yizre’el,
over Efrayim and over Binyamin—over Israel, all of it."
Ii Samuel 2:10,"Forty years old was Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul when he began to reign as king over Israel,
and for two years he reigned as king.
But the House of Judah was [following] after David."
Ii Samuel 2:11,"And the number of days that David was king in Hevron, over the House of Judah,
was seven years and six months."
Ii Samuel 2:12,"Now Avner son of Ner went out, along with the servants of Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul, from Mahanayim to Giv’on,"
Ii Samuel 2:13,"while Yoav son of Tzeruya and David’s servants went out [as well].
They met them by the Pool of Giv’on together,
and they sat down, these by the pool on this-side,
and those by the pool on that-side."
Ii Samuel 2:14,"Avner said to Yoav:
Let the fighting-lads arise and hold-a-contest before us!
Yoav said:
Let them arise!"
Ii Samuel 2:15,"So they arose and crossed over by number:
twelve for Binyamin and for Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul,
and twelve of David’s servants."
Ii Samuel 2:16,"And each one took hold of his neighbor’s head,
with his sword [thrust] into his neighbor’s side,
and they fell together.
So that place was called: Helkat Ha-Tzurim/Field of the Sword-Edges, which is in Giv’on."
Ii Samuel 2:17,"Now the battle was rough—exceedingly so—on that day,
and Avner and the men of Israel were defeated before David’s servants."
Ii Samuel 2:18,"Now three of the sons of Tzeruya were there: Yoav, Avishai, and Asa’el;
and Asa’el was swift of feet, like one of the gazelles that is in the open-field."
Ii Samuel 2:19,"Asa’el pursued after Avner;
he did not swerve to go to the right or to the left from after Avner."
Ii Samuel 2:20,"But Avner faced about after him
and said:
Is this you, Asa’el?
He said:
[It is] I."
Ii Samuel 2:21,"Avner said to him:
Swerve you to your right or to your left,
and seize for yourself one of our fighting-lads [instead], and take yourself his armor!
But Asa’el would not turn aside from [going] after him."
Ii Samuel 2:22,"Once again Avner said to Asa’el:
Turn you aside from [going] after me;
why should I strike you to the ground—
for how could I lift my face to Yoav your brother?"
Ii Samuel 2:23,"But he refused to turn aside,
so Avner struck him with the afterpart of the spear, in the abdomen,
so that the spear came out after him;
he fell there and died on the spot.
And it was: all who came to the place where Asa’el had fallen and died, stopped,"
Ii Samuel 2:24,"but Yoav and Avishai pursued after Avner.
Now when the sun had come in,
they came to the Hill of Amma, that faces Gi’ah,
on the way to the Wilderness of Giv’on."
Ii Samuel 2:25,"And the Children of Binyamin gathered themselves [to follow] after Avner;
they became a single group
and stopped at the top of a hill."
Ii Samuel 2:26,"And Avner called out to Yoav;
he said:
Is it forever that the sword must devour?
Do you not know
that it will be bitter afterward?
Until when will you not bid the fighting-people to turn back from [going] after their brothers?"
Ii Samuel 2:27,"Yoav said:
By the life of God,
indeed, had you only spoken,
indeed, already in the morning the people would have gone up, each one from [going] after his brother!"
Ii Samuel 2:28,"Then Yoav gave-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>, and all the people stopped;
they no longer pursued after Israel,
and no longer continued to do battle."
Ii Samuel 2:29,"Now Avner and his men went through the Plain all that night;
they crossed the Jordan
and went through the whole canyon, and came to Mahanayim."
Ii Samuel 2:30,"Now when Yoav returned from [going] after Avner,
he gathered all the people,
and there were counted-missing of David’s servants nineteen men along with Asa’el,"
Ii Samuel 2:31,"while David’s servants struck down some of Binyamin, among Avner’s servants—
three hundred and sixty men died."
Ii Samuel 2:32,"And they carried Asa’el away and buried him in the burial-place of his father, which is in Bet-Lehem.
Then they went all night, Yoav and his men,
with light breaking upon them in Hevron."
Ii Samuel 3:1,"And the war was long-lasting between the House of Sha’ul and the House of David;
David went on becoming stronger, while the House of Sha’ul went on becoming weaker."
Ii Samuel 3:2,"Now sons were born to David in Hevron:
his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Yezre’elite,"
Ii Samuel 3:3,"and his second was Kil’av, by Avigayil wife of Naval, the Carmelite,
and the third was Avshalom son of Maakha, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur,"
Ii Samuel 3:4,"and the fourth was Adoniyya son of Haggit,
and the fifth was Shefatya son of Avital,"
Ii Samuel 3:5,"and the sixth was Yitre’am, by Egla wife of David.
These were born to David in Hevron."
Ii Samuel 3:6,"And it was,
when there was war between the House of Sha’ul and the House of David,
that Avner was gaining strength in the House of Sha’ul."
Ii Samuel 3:7,"Now Sha’ul had a concubine, her name was Ritzpa daughter of Aya.
And [Ish-Boshet] said to Avner:
For-what-reason did you come in to my father’s concubine?"
Ii Samuel 3:8,"Avner became exceedingly agitated over the words of Ish-Boshet;
he said:
Am I the head of a dog belonging to Judah?
Today I do an act-of-loyalty to the House of Sha’ul your father,
for his brothers and for his friends,
and have not let you come into David’s hand—
yet you account me with a fault concerning a woman today!"
Ii Samuel 3:9,"Thus may God do to Avner, and thus may he add to him;
indeed, [just] as Y<small>HWH</small> swore to David,
indeed, thus I will do to him—"
Ii Samuel 3:10,"to have the kingship cross over from the House of Sha’ul,
to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah,
from Dan to Be’er-Sheva!"
Ii Samuel 3:11,"He was not able to answer Avner another word, out of his fear of him."
Ii Samuel 3:12,"And Avner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying:
Whose is [the] land?
Cut your covenant with me,
Here, my hand is with you, to bring all Israel around to you!"
Ii Samuel 3:13,"He said:
Good,
I myself will cut a covenant with you;
but one thing I will require of you, namely:
you are not to see my face
unless you first bring Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul, when you come to see my face."
Ii Samuel 3:14,"So David sent messengers to Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul, saying:
Give over my wife, Mikhal,
whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred Philistine foreskins!"
Ii Samuel 3:15,"Ish-Boshet sent and took her from [her] husband, from Paltiel son of Layish."
Ii Samuel 3:16,"And her husband went with her, going along and weeping behind her, as far as Bahurim.
Then Avner said to him:
Go, turn back! And he turned back."
Ii Samuel 3:17,"Now the word of Avner was with the elders of Israel, saying:
Even yesterday, even [the] day-before, you have been seeking [to set] David as king over you."
Ii Samuel 3:18,"So-now, do it!
For Y<small>HWH</small> has said of David, saying:
By the hand of David my servant
I will deliver my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies!"
Ii Samuel 3:19,"Avner spoke likewise in the hearing of Binyamin,
and Avner went likewise to speak in the hearing of David in Hevron
all that was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the House of Binyamin."
Ii Samuel 3:20,"And Avner came to David in Hevron,
—with him were twenty men—
and David made a drinkfest for Avner and for the men who were with him."
Ii Samuel 3:21,"Then Avner said to David:
Let me arise, let me go,
and let me gather all Israel to my lord king,
that they may cut a covenant with you
and that you may become king according to all that your appetite craves.
So David sent Avner away,
and he went off in peace."
Ii Samuel 3:22,"Now here, David’s servants and Yoav came back from raiding, and abundant spoils they brought with them—
but Avner was not with David in Hevron,
for he had sent him off, and he had gone away in peace."
Ii Samuel 3:23,"When Yoav and all the forces that were with him came, [someone] told Yoav, saying:
Avner the son of Ner came to the king,
but he sent him off and he went away in peace!"
Ii Samuel 3:24,"So Yoav came to the king and said:
What have you done?
Here, Avner came to you—
why now did you send him off,
so that he has gone, yes, gone?"
Ii Samuel 3:25,"You know Avner the son of Ner:
indeed, to dupe you he came,
to gain knowledge of your going out and your coming in,
and to gain knowledge of all that you are doing!"
Ii Samuel 3:26,"So Yoav went out from David,
and he sent messengers after Avner;
they returned him from the cistern of Sira,
but David did not know [about it]."
Ii Samuel 3:27,"Avner returned to Hevron,
and Yoav took him to the inner-part of the gate, to speak with him quietly,
but he struck him in the abdomen, so that he died,
[in exchange] for the blood of Asa’el his brother."
Ii Samuel 3:28,"David heard [of it], after this,
and said:
Clear-of-blame am I and my kingdom by Y<small>HWH</small>, for the ages,
from the blood of Avner son of Ner—"
Ii Samuel 3:29,"may it alight on the head of Yoav and on all his Father’s House;
may there never be cut off from the House of Yoav
[anyone] with a flow, or with <i>tzaraat</i>,
or [a male] taking hold of a spindle, or one falling by the sword, or one lacking food!"
Ii Samuel 3:30,"Now Yoav and Avishai his brother had killed Avner
on account that he had caused the death of Asa’el their brother at Giv’on, in battle."
Ii Samuel 3:31,"And David said to Yoav and to all the people that were with him:
Tear your garments and gird yourselves with sackcloth,
and beat [the breast] before Avner!
Now King David [himself] walked after the bier."
Ii Samuel 3:32,"They buried Avner in Hevron,
and the king lifted up his voice and wept upon the burial-place of Avner,
and all the people wept."
Ii Samuel 3:33,"And the king intoned-a-dirge over Avner; he said:
Like the death of a vile one, should Avner have died?"
Ii Samuel 3:34,"Your hands were not bound,
your feet were not put in double-bronze;
like one falling before the corrupt you fell!
And all the people continued to weep over him."
Ii Samuel 3:35,"Then all the people came to nourish David with bread while it was daylight,
but David swore, saying:
Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add,
if before the coming in of the sun I taste bread or anything [else]!"
Ii Samuel 3:36,"All the people took note, and it was good in their eyes;
like all that the king did, in the eyes of the people it was good."
Ii Samuel 3:37,"So all the people and all Israel knew on that day
that it had not been from the king to cause the death of Avner son of Ner."
Ii Samuel 3:38,"The king said to his servants:
Do you not know
that a commander and a great [man] has fallen in Israel this day?"
Ii Samuel 3:39,"As for me, today I am softhearted, though anointed as king,
while these men, the sons of Tzeruya, are too rough for me!
May Y<small>HWH</small> pay back the doer of evil in accordance with his evil-deed!"
Ii Samuel 4:1,"The son of Sha’ul heard that Avner was dead in Hevron,
and his hands grew slack,
while all Israel were terrified."
Ii Samuel 4:2,"Now two men, commanders of raiding-bands, belonged to the son of Sha’ul;
the name of the one was Baana, and the name of the second was Rekhav,
sons of Rimmon the Be’erotite, of the Children of Binyamin.
—For Be’erot too was reckoned to Binyamin:"
Ii Samuel 4:3,"the Be’erotites had got away to Gittayim,
and they have continued sojourning there, until this day.—"
Ii Samuel 4:4,"Now Yehonatan son of Sha’ul had a son, stricken in the feet;
he had been five years old when the tidings had come of Sha’ul and Yehonatan, from Yizre’el,
and his caretaker had lifted him up and fled.
It was in her haste to flee that he had fallen and been made lame.
—His name was Mefiboshet."
Ii Samuel 4:5,"So the sons of Rimmon the Be’erotite, Rekhav and Baana, went
and came, at the heat of the day, to the house of Ish-Boshet,
while he was lying down for the noonday nap."
Ii Samuel 4:6,"And here, when they came into the midst of the house, as fetchers of wheat,
they struck him in the abdomen;
then Rekhav and Baana his brother escaped."
Ii Samuel 4:7,"—They had come into the house
while he was lying on his couch, in his bedroom,
and had struck him down and caused his death,
and had removed his head.—
They took his head
and went off, by way of the Plain, all night,"
Ii Samuel 4:8,"and they brought the head of Ish-Boshet to David at Hevron,
and said to the king:
Here is the head of Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul your enemy, who sought your life—
Y<small>HWH</small> has granted vengeance to my lord king this day on Sha’ul and on his seed!"
Ii Samuel 4:9,"David answered Rekhav and Baana his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Be’erotite;
he said to them:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
who has saved my life from every trouble:"
Ii Samuel 4:10,"indeed, the one telling me, saying: Here, Sha’ul is dead!,
though he was like a bearer-of-[good]-news in his [own] eyes,
I seized him and killed him in Tziklag,
one to whom I might have given [reward for the] news!"
Ii Samuel 4:11,"More so, when guilty men have killed an innocent man in his house, in his bedroom!
So-now,
should I not seek-satisfaction for his blood at your hand,
and eradicate you from the land?"
Ii Samuel 4:12,"So David commanded the fighting-lads,
and they killed them and chopped off their hands and their feet
and hung them up by the pool in Hevron,
while the head of Ish-Boshet they took
and buried in the burial-place of Avner in Hevron."
Ii Samuel 5:1,"All the staff-bearers of Israel came to David in Hevron;
they said, saying:
Here we are—your bone and your flesh are we!"
Ii Samuel 5:2,"Even yesterday, even the day-before, when Sha’ul was king over us,
it was you who took out and brought back Israel [in battle],
and Y<small>HWH</small> said to you:
<i>You</i> shall shepherd my people Israel,
<i>you</i> shall be <i>Nagid</i> over Israel!"
Ii Samuel 5:3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hevron,
and King David cut a covenant with them at Hevron, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and they anointed David as king over Israel."
Ii Samuel 5:4,"Thirty years old was David when he became king;
for forty years he reigned as king:"
Ii Samuel 5:5,"in Hevron he reigned as king over Judah for seven years and six months,
and in Jerusalem he reigned as king for thirty-three years, over all Israel and Judah."
Ii Samuel 5:6,"Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Yevusites, the settled-folk of the region,
but they said to David, saying:
You are not to enter here!
—For the blind and the lame had incited them, saying:
David is not to enter here!—"
Ii Samuel 5:7,But David captured the Fortress of Zion—that is the city of David.
Ii Samuel 5:8,"And David said on that day:
Whoever strikes down a Yevusite
and reaches the water-shaft … ,
since the lame and the blind are hated by David’s very self;
therefore they say:
The blind and the lame are not to enter the Temple-House!"
Ii Samuel 5:9,"David settled in the fortress,
and he called it the City of David;
and David built all around, from the Earthfill and inward."
Ii Samuel 5:10,"And David went on and on becoming great;
Y<small>HWH</small>, God of the Forces-On-High, was with him."
Ii Samuel 5:11,"Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David,
along with cedar wood and wood carvers and stone wall carvers;
they built a palace-house for David."
Ii Samuel 5:12,"And David knew that Y<small>HWH</small> had established him as king over Israel,
and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel."
Ii Samuel 5:13,"David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, after his coming back from Hevron,
and more [children] were born to David, sons and daughters."
Ii Samuel 5:14,"And these are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem:
Shammua and Shovav,
Natan and Shelomo,"
Ii Samuel 5:15,"Yivhar and Elishua, Nefeg and Yafi’a,"
Ii Samuel 5:16,"Elishama, Elyada and Elifelet."
Ii Samuel 5:17,"The Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel,
so all the Philistines went up to seek out David.
David heard, and he went down to the fortress."
Ii Samuel 5:18,"Now the Philistines had come
and had spread out in the Valley of the Shades."
Ii Samuel 5:19,"So David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Shall I go up against the Philistines?
Will you give them into my hand?
Y<small>HWH</small> said to David:
Go up,
for I will give, yes, give the Philistines into your hand!"
Ii Samuel 5:20,"David came to Baal-Peratzim/Master of Bursting Forth,
and David struck them there;
he said:
Y<small>HWH</small> has burst my enemies before me like a bursting forth of water!
Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-Peratzim/Master of Bursting Forth."
Ii Samuel 5:21,"They abandoned their idols there,
and David and his men carried them off."
Ii Samuel 5:22,"But the Philistines went up again,
and spread out in the Valley of the Shades."
Ii Samuel 5:23,"So David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and he said:
You are not to go up;
lead [your men] around, behind them,
and come at them in front of the balsam-trees."
Ii Samuel 5:24,"And let it be:
when you hear the sound of marching on the tops of the balsam-trees, then you are to act-decisively,
for then Y<small>HWH</small> will go out before you, to strike down the camp of the Philistines."
Ii Samuel 5:25,"David did thus, as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him;
he struck the Philistines from Geva until where-you-come to Gezer."
Ii Samuel 6:1,"David continued [gathering] every hand-picked [man] in Israel, thirty thousand."
Ii Samuel 6:2,"And David arose and went, along with all the fighting-people who were with him, from Baala in Judah,
to bring up from there the Coffer of God, over which was called the name of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, [The One] Seated on the Winged-Sphinxes."
Ii Samuel 6:3,"They mounted the Coffer of God on a new wagon
and transported it from the house of Avinadav, which is in Giv’a,
while Uzza and Ahyo, the sons of Avinadav, were driving the new wagon."
Ii Samuel 6:4,"They transported it from the house of Avinadav that is in Giv’a, with the Coffer of God,
with Ahyo walking in front of the Coffer."
Ii Samuel 6:5,"Now David and the whole house of Israel were dancing in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
with all the fir wood [instruments],
with lyres and with lutes and with timbrels,
with rattles and with cymbals."
Ii Samuel 6:6,"They came to the threshing-floor of Nakhon,
and Uzza stretched out [his hand] to the Coffer of God and took hold of it,
for the oxen had let it slip."
Ii Samuel 6:7,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up at Uzza,
and God struck him down there because of [his] carelessness, so that he died there,
beside the Coffer of God."
Ii Samuel 6:8,"And David was agitated over [the fact] that Y<small>HWH</small> had burst forth, a bursting forth against Uzza,
so that place is called Peretz Uzza/Bursting Forth [at] Uzza,
until this day."
Ii Samuel 6:9,"And David was fearful of God on that day;
he said:
How will the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> [ever] come to me?"
Ii Samuel 6:10,"And David would not remove the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> from him to the City of David,
so David turned it aside to the house of Oved-Edom the Gittite."
Ii Samuel 6:11,"The Coffer stayed at the house of Oved-Edom the Gittite for three months,
and Y<small>HWH</small> blessed Oved-Edom and all his household."
Ii Samuel 6:12,"It was told to King David, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> has blessed the house of Oved-Edom and all that is his, on account of the Coffer of God;
so David went and brought up the Coffer of God from the house of Oved-Edom to the City of David, with rejoicing."
Ii Samuel 6:13,"It was,
when those transporting the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> had stepped forward six steps,
that he sacrificed an ox and a fatling."
Ii Samuel 6:14,"And David was whirling with all [his] might in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
David was girded with an <i>efod</i> of linen."
Ii Samuel 6:15,Now David and all the House of Israel were bringing up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> with shouting and with the sound of the <i>shofar;</i>
Ii Samuel 6:16,"and as the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> was coming into the City of David,
Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul was looking out through the window:
she saw King David leaping and whirling in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and she despised him in her heart."
Ii Samuel 6:17,"They brought the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>
and set it in its place, in the middle of the tent that David had spread out for it.
And David offered up offerings-up in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, and <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
Ii Samuel 6:18,"[When] David had finished offering up the offering-up and the <i>shalom</i>-offerings,
he blessed the people in the name of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High,"
Ii Samuel 6:19,"and divided up [food] for the whole people, for the whole throng of Israel, from man to woman
—for each: one cake of bread, one roll, and one raisin-cake—
and all the people went off, each one to his house."
Ii Samuel 6:20,"Then David returned to bless his household;
but Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul went out to meet David
and said:
How he has gotten honor today, the king of Israel,
who has exposed himself today before the eyes of his servants’ maids—
like one of [those] empty-men exposes himself!"
Ii Samuel 6:21,"David said to Mikhal:
In the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, who chose me over your father and over all his house, to commission me as <i>Nagid</i> over the people of Y<small>HWH</small>, over Israel:
I’ll dance in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Ii Samuel 6:22,"and will hold-myself-lightly more than this;
I’ll be lowly in my own eyes—
with the serving-maids of whom you spoke,
with <i>them</i> I’ll get honor!"
Ii Samuel 6:23,"And Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul had no child
until the day of her death."
Ii Samuel 7:1,"Now it was
when the king sat in his house
—Y<small>HWH</small> had given-him-rest, round about, from all his enemies—"
Ii Samuel 7:2,"that the king said to Natan the prophet:
Now see:
I stay in a house of cedars,
while the Coffer of God stays in the midst of a curtained-shrine!"
Ii Samuel 7:3,"Natan said to the king:
All that is in your heart, go, do,
for Y<small>HWH</small> is with you."
Ii Samuel 7:4,"But it was on that very night
that the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Natan, saying:"
Ii Samuel 7:5,"Go and say to my servant, to David:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
Will <i>you</i> build me a house to stay in?"
Ii Samuel 7:6,"For I have not stayed in a house
from the day of my bringing up the Children of Israel from Egypt until this day;
but I have been going about in Tent and in Dwelling."
Ii Samuel 7:7,"Wherever I have been going about among all the Children of Israel,
have I ever spoken a word with one of the judge-leaders of Israel whom I commisioned to shepherd my people Israel, saying:
Why have you not built me a house of cedars?"
Ii Samuel 7:8,"So-now,
thus are you to say to my servant, to David:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High:
I myself took you from the pasture, from [following] after the flock,
to be <i>Nagid</i> over my people, over Israel."
Ii Samuel 7:9,"I have been with you wherever you have gone,
and have cut off all your enemies from before you.
And I will make you a great name,
like the name of the great-ones who are on the earth,"
Ii Samuel 7:10,"and I will make a place for my people, for Israel:
I will plant them,
and they will dwell beneath it,
so that they will shudder no more,
so that malicious ones will not continue to afflict them, as in former-times,"
Ii Samuel 7:11,"from the day that I commisioned judges over my people Israel.
And I will give-you-rest from all your enemies.
Y<small>HWH</small> has told you that Y<small>HWH</small> will make you a house:"
Ii Samuel 7:12,"when your days are fulfilled
and you lie beside your fathers,
I will raise up your seed after you,
one who comes out from your body,
and I will make his kingdom firm."
Ii Samuel 7:13,"<i>He</i> will build a house to my name,
and I will make his kingly throne firm for the ages;"
Ii Samuel 7:14,"I will be to him as a father,
and he will be to me as a son.
When he commits-iniquity,
I will rebuke him with the staff of men, and with the blows of humans;"
Ii Samuel 7:15,"but my loyal-love I will not turn aside from him,
as I turned aside from Sha’ul, from whom I turned aside before you."
Ii Samuel 7:16,"Secure will be your house and your kingdom for the ages before me;
your throne will be firm for the ages!"
Ii Samuel 7:17,"According to all these words and according to all this vision,
thus did Natan speak to David."
Ii Samuel 7:18,"King David came and sat in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
he said:
Who am I, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>,
and who is my household,
that you have brought me this far?"
Ii Samuel 7:19,"And still this was too small in your eyes, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>—
you have also spoken of your servant’s house in a distant-time!
This is the rule for a man-of-status, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Samuel 7:20,"And what more can David speak further to you,
since you yourself know your servant, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>?"
Ii Samuel 7:21,"For the sake of your word and in accordance with your heart
you have done all this greatness,
to make it known to your servant."
Ii Samuel 7:22,"Therefore you are great, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>;
indeed, there is none like you
and no God beside you
according to all that we have heard with our ears."
Ii Samuel 7:23,"And who is like your people, like Israel,
a singular nation on earth,
whom God went forth to redeem for himself as a people,
to make for himself a name
and to do for you great things, and awe-inspiring [acts] for your land,
before your people whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt,
[driving out] nations and their gods?"
Ii Samuel 7:24,"You have made your people Israel firm, as a people for yourself for the ages,
and you, O Y<small>HWH</small>, you have become God for them."
Ii Samuel 7:25,"So-now, O Y<small>HWH</small> God,
as for the word that you have spoken about your servant and about his house—
establish [it] for the ages,
and do as you have spoken."
Ii Samuel 7:26,"And may your name be great for the ages, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High is God over Israel,
and the house of your servant David—may it be firm before you!"
Ii Samuel 7:27,"For you, O Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, God of Israel,
have bared your servant’s ear, saying:
A house will I build for you;
therefore your servant has found his heart to pray to you this prayer."
Ii Samuel 7:28,"So-now, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>,
you are God, and your words are truth;
you have spoken this good [thing] to your servant."
Ii Samuel 7:29,"So-now,
be pleased and bless the house of your servant,
to be in your presence for the ages,
for you, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>, you have spoken it,
and through your blessing may the house of your servant be blessed for the ages!"
Ii Samuel 8:1,"It was [some time] after this
that David struck the Philistines and humbled them,
and David took Meteg Amma from the hand of the Philistines."
Ii Samuel 8:2,"Then he struck Moav,
and he measured them with a rope, making them lie down on the ground—
he measured two rope-lengths for putting to death
and a full rope-length for letting [them] live.
And Moav became servants to David, bearers of tribute."
Ii Samuel 8:3,"Then David struck Hadad’ezer/Hadad is Help, son of Rehov, king of Tzova,
as he was going to restore his monument at the River;"
Ii Samuel 8:4,"David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand men, foot-soldiers,
and David maimed all the chariot-horses, and left of them [only] a hundred chariot-horses."
Ii Samuel 8:5,"And Arameans from Damascus came, to help Hadad’ezer king of Tzova,
and David struck down from Aram twenty thousand men."
Ii Samuel 8:6,"David put standing-garrisons at Aram of Damascus,
and Aram became servants to David, bearers of tribute.
Thus Y<small>HWH</small> delivered David wherever he went."
Ii Samuel 8:7,"And David took the gold bow cases that were upon Hadad’ezer’s servants
and brought them to Jerusalem,"
Ii Samuel 8:8,"while from Betah and from Berotai, Hadad’ezer’s towns,
King David took an exceedingly great [amount of] bronze."
Ii Samuel 8:9,"And To’i king of Hamat heard that David had struck down Hadad’ezer’s entire army,"
Ii Samuel 8:10,"so To’i sent Yoram his son to King David,
to inquire of his welfare and to give-him-blessing
on account of his waging battle against Hadad’ezer, and [that] he had struck him down,
—for a man waging battle with To’i was Hadad’ezer—
and in his hand were objects of silver and objects of gold and objects of bronze."
Ii Samuel 8:11,"These too David hallowed to Y<small>HWH</small>,
with the silver and the gold that he had hallowed from all the nations that he had subdued:"
Ii Samuel 8:12,"from Edom and from Moav, and from the Children of Ammon,
from the Philistines and from Amalek,
and from the spoil of Hadad’ezer son of Rehov, king of Tzova."
Ii Samuel 8:13,"And David made a name [for himself] on his return from striking Edom in the Valley of Salt, eighteen thousand [dead]."
Ii Samuel 8:14,"He put garrisons in Edom—throughout all Edom he put garrisons—
and all Edom became servants to David.
Thus Y<small>HWH</small> delivered David wherever he went."
Ii Samuel 8:15,"David reigned as king over all Israel,
and David instituted justice and equity for all his people."
Ii Samuel 8:16,"Now Yoav son of Tzeruya was [The One] Over the Armed-Forces,
and Yehoshafat son of Ahilud was Herald,"
Ii Samuel 8:17,"and Tzadok son of Ahituv and Avimelekh son of Evyatar were priests,
and Seraya was scribe,"
Ii Samuel 8:18,"and Benayahu son of Yehoyada was [The One Over] the Kereitites and the Peleitites,
while the sons of David—they were priests."
Ii Samuel 9:1,"David said:
Is there yet anyone that remains from the House of Sha’ul?
—so that I may show him loyalty for the sake of Yehonatan."
Ii Samuel 9:2,"Now the House of Sha’ul had a servant, his name was Tziva,
and they called him to David.
The king said to him:
Are you Tziva?
He said:
Your servant."
Ii Samuel 9:3,"The king said:
Is there no one still [alive] from the House of Sha’ul,
that I may show him the loyalty of God?
Tziva said to the king:
There is still a son of Yehonatan, stricken in the feet."
Ii Samuel 9:4,"The king said to him:
Where is he?
Tziva said to the king:
Here, he is at the house of Makhir son of Ammiel, in Lo-Devar."
Ii Samuel 9:5,"So King David sent and had him taken from the house of Makhir son of Ammiel, from Lo-Devar."
Ii Samuel 9:6,"And Mefiboshet son of Yehonatan son of Sha’ul came to David,
and he flung himself on his face and bowed low.
David said: Mefiboshet!
He said:
Here is your servant."
Ii Samuel 9:7,"David said to him:
Do not be afraid,
for I will show, yes, show you loyalty for the sake of Yehonatan your father;
I will return to you all the lands of Sha’ul your [grand]father,
and you, you will eat bread at my table regularly."
Ii Samuel 9:8,"He bowed low and said:
What is your servant,
that you have turned your face toward a dead dog like me?"
Ii Samuel 9:9,"The king called Tziva, Sha’ul’s serving-lad, and said to him:
All that belonged to Sha’ul and to all his household, I give to your lord’s [grand]son;"
Ii Samuel 9:10,"you are to work the ground for him, you and your children and your servants,
and you are to bring in [the produce], so that it may be food for your lord’s grandson, and he may eat it,
while Mefiboshet, your lord’s grandson, shall eat bread regularly at my table.
—Now Tziva had fifteen sons and twenty servants.—"
Ii Samuel 9:11,"Tziva said to the king:
According to all that my lord king commands his servant,
thus will your servant do.
So Mefiboshet was eating at David’s table, like one of the king’s sons."
Ii Samuel 9:12,"Now Mefiboshet had a young son, his name was Mikha,
while all those dwelling in Tziva’s house were servants to Mefiboshet."
Ii Samuel 9:13,"And Mefiboshet stayed in Jerusalem,
for at the king’s table he ate regularly.
Now he was lame in his two feet."
Ii Samuel 10:1,"It was [some time] after this
that the king of the Children of Ammon died,
and Hanun his son became king in his stead."
Ii Samuel 10:2,"David said:
I will show loyalty to Hanun son of Nahash,
as his father showed loyalty to me.
So David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants, for his father,
and David’s servants came to the land of the Children of Ammon."
Ii Samuel 10:3,"But the officials of the Children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord:
Is David [really] honoring your father in your eyes,
when he sends you comforters?
Isn’t it for the sake of spying out the town, to explore it and to overthrow it
that David has sent his servants to you?"
Ii Samuel 10:4,"So Hanun took David’s servants,
he shaved off half their beards
and cut their clothes in half, as far as their buttocks,
and then he sent them off."
Ii Samuel 10:5,"They told David,
and he sent [men] to meet them,
for the men were exceedingly humiliated.
The king said:
Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown;
then you may return."
Ii Samuel 10:6,"The Children of Ammon saw that they had made-themselves-reek to David,
so the Children of Ammon sent and hired Arameans from Bet-Rehov and Arameans from Tzova, twenty thousand foot-soldiers,
the king of Maakha, [with] a thousand men,
and men of Tov, twelve thousand men."
Ii Samuel 10:7,"David heard,
and he sent Yoav and all the armed-forces, the mighty-men."
Ii Samuel 10:8,"And the Children of Ammon went out and arranged-ranks for battle, at the entrance to the gate,
while the Arameans from Tzova and Rehov and the men of Tov and Maakha were alone in the open-field."
Ii Samuel 10:9,"And Yoav saw that the face of battle was upon him, in front and in back,
so he chose from all the choice-warriors in Israel
and arranged-ranks to meet the Arameans,"
Ii Samuel 10:10,"while the rest of the fighting-people he placed in the hand of Avishai his brother,
and arranged-ranks to meet the Children of Ammon."
Ii Samuel 10:11,"He said:
If Aram is too strong for me,
you will be deliverance for me,
and if the Children of Ammon are too strong for you,
I will go to deliver you!"
Ii Samuel 10:12,"Be strong and let us be strengthened, on behalf of our people and on behalf of the towns of our God,
while Y<small>HWH</small>—may he do what is good in his eyes!"
Ii Samuel 10:13,"And Yoav approached, and the fighting-people who were with him, for battle against Aram,
and they fled before him."
Ii Samuel 10:14,"Now when the Children of Ammon saw that Aram had fled,
they fled before Avishai and came back to the town.
Then Yoav turned from [attacking] the Children of Ammon, and came back to Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 10:15,"And Aram saw that they were defeated before Israel,
so they gathered together,"
Ii Samuel 10:16,"and Hadad’ezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were across the River, so that they came to Helam,
with Shovakh commander of Hadad’ezer’s forces in front of them."
Ii Samuel 10:17,"It was told to David,
so he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam,
and the Arameans arrayed-ranks to meet David, and waged battle with him."
Ii Samuel 10:18,"And the Arameans fled before Israel;
David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen from Aram,
while Shovakh, the commander of Hadad’ezer’s forces, he struck down, so that he died there."
Ii Samuel 10:19,"And all the kings, Hadad’ezer’s servants, saw that they had been defeated before Israel,
so they made-peace with Israel and served them,
for the Arameans were afraid to deliver the Children of Ammon any longer."
Ii Samuel 11:1,"Now it was at the turning of the year, at the time of kings’ going forth,
that David sent Yoav and his servants with him, and all Israel:
they wrought-ruin to the Children of Ammon and besieged Rabba,
while David stayed in Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 11:2,"Now it was around the time of sunset
that David arose from his lying-place and went-for-a-walk on the roof of the king’s house,
and he saw a woman washing herself, from on the roof—
the woman was exceedingly fair of appearance."
Ii Samuel 11:3,"David sent and inquired after the woman,
and they said: Is this not Bat-Sheva daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriyya the Hittite?"
Ii Samuel 11:4,"David sent messengers, and he had her taken:
she came to him and he lay with her
—now she had just purified herself from her state-of-<i>tum’a</i>—
and then she returned to her house."
Ii Samuel 11:5,"The woman became pregnant;
she sent [word] and had it told to David, she said:
I am pregnant!
One might also note the text’s repetition of “eat,” a possible sexual metaphor, and “dead,” with the illegitimate child’s demise echoing Uriyya’s as a kind of payback. Additionally, the story uses various meanings of the term “house,” in an even broader spread than what we observed in Chap. 7. Indeed, the whole narrative here seems to be structured upon the movement of various characters from house to house—the palace, Uriyya’s home, the sanctuary (“Y<small>HWH</small>’s House”), and the domicile of the prophet Natan. Looming over all the physical movement is the eventual fate of David’s household and his dynastic house.
The story finds additional uses for the sound of words. Natan’s little parable in Chap. 12, which some scholars feel does not fit the situation very well, is profoundly connected to its referent by the prophet’s description of the poor man’s lamb in 12:3: “from his morsel it would eat, from his cup it would drink, in his bosom it would lie— / it became to him like a daughter/<i>bat</i>.” As literary critics have long pointed out (see, for instance, Simon 1967), the “eat/drink/lie” sequence echoes Uriyya’s earlier refusal of 11:11, quoted above, and the coincidence of <i>Bat</i>-Sheva’s name is surely nothing of the kind. So when the unwitting king angrily condemns the rich man of the parable, the audience, its ears tuned aright, can sense the springing of the trap.
Also significant, and almost unprecedented in biblical poetry, is God’s message in 12:11. It is noteworthy in its rhetoric and unprecedented in its use of rhyme, here represented in English by six consecutive lines that echo “your …” It is as if God’s words, thus delivered, cannot be ignored, if only because the rhyme makes them reverberate throughout the throne room.
A final stylistic point has been noted by Brueggemann (1990). There are three dramatic two-word phrases in Hebrew, impossible, at least for me, to reproduce in English: “I am pregnant” (11:5), “You are the man!” (12:7), and “I have sinned against Y<small>HWH</small>!” (12:13). The brevity of biblical language, here as elsewhere, makes for heightened emotional impact.
The David and Bat-Sheva story is an intimate look at David’s many moods, and shows what he is capable of, for good and for ill, in a variety of situations. As presented in II Samuel, it is a moment from which David, despite the relatively happy endings of this chapter (Shelomo’s birth and David’s capture of Rabba), can never fully recover. From this point forward in his life, the misfortunes of Israel will be identical with those of the House of David."
Ii Samuel 11:6,"So David sent [word] to Yoav:
Send me Uriyya the Hittite.
And Yoav sent Uriyya to David."
Ii Samuel 11:7,"Uriyya came to him,
and David asked after the welfare of Yoav, the welfare of the fighting-people, and the welfare of the battle;"
Ii Samuel 11:8,"then David said to Uriyya:
Go down to your house and wash your feet!
Uriyya went out of the king’s house,
and after him went out a portion from the king,"
Ii Samuel 11:9,"but Uriyya lay down at the entrance to the king’s house, with all his lord’s servants;
he did not go down to his house."
Ii Samuel 11:10,"They told David, saying:
Uriyya has not gone down to his house.
David said to Uriyya:
Isn’t it from a [long] journey that you have come?
For-what-reason have you not gone down to your house?"
Ii Samuel 11:11,"Uriyya said to David:
The Coffer and Israel and Judah are staying at Sukkot,
my lord Yoav and my lord’s servants are camping on the surface of the open-field—
and I, I should come into my house
to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife?
By your life and by your [very] self: If I were to do this thing … !"
Ii Samuel 11:12,"David said to Uriyya:
Stay here today as well; tomorrow I will send you off.
So Uriyya stayed in Jerusalem on that day."
Ii Samuel 11:13,"Now on the morrow David had him called, and he ate and drank in his presence,
and he made him drunk.
He went out in the evening to lie down in his lying-place with his lord’s servants,
but to his house he did not go down."
Ii Samuel 11:14,"So it was in the morning
that David wrote a letter to Yoav and sent it by the hand of Uriyya,"
Ii Samuel 11:15,"and he wrote in the letter, saying:
Put Uriyya facing the strongest [point of] battle,
and turn back behind him, so that he is struck down and dies."
Ii Samuel 11:16,"So it was
when Yoav had observed the city,
that he placed Uriyya at the place where he knew that there were men of valor;"
Ii Samuel 11:17,"the men of the city went out and did battle with Yoav,
and there fell some of the fighting-people, of David’s servants,
and there died also Uriyya the Hittite."
Ii Samuel 11:18,Yoav sent and had David told all the details about the battle;
Ii Samuel 11:19,"he charged the messenger, saying:
When you have finished reporting everything about the battle to the king,"
Ii Samuel 11:20,"it will be:
if the king’s anger starts up and he says to you:
For-what-reason did you draw near the city to do battle?
Did you not know that they would shoot down from on the wall?"
Ii Samuel 11:21,"Who struck down Avimelekh son of Yerubboshet—
did not a woman throw down on him a riding millstone from on the wall,
so that he died at Tevetz?
Why did you approach the wall?—
Then you are to say:
Also your servant Uriyya the Hittite is dead."
Ii Samuel 11:22,"The messenger went off, he came and told David all that Yoav had sent him [to say];"
Ii Samuel 11:23,"the messenger said to David:
Indeed, the men were mightier than we, they went out at us in the open-field;
we were upon them, up to the entrance to the gate,"
Ii Samuel 11:24,"but the shooters shot down at your servants from on the wall,
so that there died some of the king’s servants,
and also your servant Uriyya the Hittite is dead."
Ii Samuel 11:25,"David said to the messenger:
Say thus to Yoav:
Do not let this thing be evil in your eyes,
for like this and like that the sword devours!
Strengthen your battle against the city and destroy it!
And [you] strengthen him!"
Ii Samuel 11:26,"Uriyya’s wife heard that her husband was dead,
so she beat [the breast] for her lord."
Ii Samuel 11:27,"But when the mourning-period was past, David sent and had her brought to his house;
she became his wife, and she bore him a son.
But the thing that David had done was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Ii Samuel 12:1,"and Y<small>HWH</small> sent Natan to David;
he came to him and said to him:
There were two men in a certain town,
one rich and one poor."
Ii Samuel 12:2,"The rich one had flocks and herds, exceedingly many,"
Ii Samuel 12:3,"while the poor one had nothing at all except for one little lamb which he had bought;
he kept-it-alive, and it grew up with him, together with his children:
from his morsel it would eat, from his cup it would drink, in his bosom it would lie—
it became to him like a daughter/<i>bat</i>."
Ii Samuel 12:4,"A journey-walker came to the rich man,
but he thought-it-a-pity to take from his flocks or from his herds, to make ready for the wayfarer who had come to him,
so he took the poor man’s lamb and made it ready for the man who had come to him."
Ii Samuel 12:5,"David’s anger flared up exceedingly against the man,
and he said to Natan:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
indeed, a son of death is the man who does this!"
Ii Samuel 12:6,"And for the lamb he shall pay fourfold,
because he did this thing, and since he had no pity!"
Ii Samuel 12:7,"Natan said to David:
You are the man!
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
I myself anointed you king over Israel,
I myself rescued you from the hand of Sha’ul,"
Ii Samuel 12:8,"I gave you the house of your lord, and the women of your lord into your bosom,
I gave you the House of Israel and Judah—
and as if [that were] too little, I would have added yet this and that to you."
Ii Samuel 12:9,"For-what-reason have you despised the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, to do what is evil in my eyes?
Uriyya the Hittite you have struck down by the sword,
and his wife you have taken for yourself as a wife—
while him you have killed by means of the sword of the Children of Ammon!"
Ii Samuel 12:10,"So-now—
the sword shall not depart from your house for the ages,
because you despised me and took the wife of Uriyya the Hittite to be a wife for you!"
Ii Samuel 12:11,"Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
Here, I will raise up against your [person]
evil from your house;
I will take away your women
from before your eyes,
I will give them to your fellow
and he will lie with your women,
under the eyes of this sun."
Ii Samuel 12:12,"For you, you did it in secret,
but I, I will do this thing in front of all Israel and in front of the sun."
Ii Samuel 12:13,"David said to Natan:
I have sinned against Y<small>HWH</small>!
Natan said to David:
As for Y<small>HWH</small>, he has transferred your sin—
you will not die;"
Ii Samuel 12:14,"nevertheless, because you have scorned, yes, scorned “Y<small>HWH</small>’s enemies” by this thing,
as for the son who is born to you: he must die, yes, die!"
Ii Samuel 12:15,"Natan went back to his house.
And Y<small>HWH</small> attacked the child that Uriyya’s wife had borne to David, so that he became sick."
Ii Samuel 12:16,"David besought God on behalf of the boy,
and David fasted a fast;
he would come and spend-the-night lying on the ground."
Ii Samuel 12:17,"And the elders of his house arose about him to raise him up from the ground,
but he was unwilling and would not be nourished with food with them."
Ii Samuel 12:18,"Now it was on the seventh day that the child died.
David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said:
Here, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, but he did not hearken to our voice;
so how can we say to him: The child is dead? He might do evil!"
Ii Samuel 12:19,"David saw that his servants were whispering [among themselves];
and David understood that the child was dead.
David said to his servants:
Is the child dead?
They said:
[He is] dead."
Ii Samuel 12:20,"Then David arose from the ground;
he washed, and poured [oil on himself], and changed his clothes,
and he came into the house of Y<small>HWH</small> and bowed down;
then he came back to his house, requested that they put food before him, and ate."
Ii Samuel 12:21,"His servants said to him:
What [kind of] thing is this that you have done?
For the sake of the living child, you fasted and wept,
but now that the child is dead, you arise and eat food!"
Ii Samuel 12:22,"He said:
As long as the child was still alive, I fasted and wept,
for I said [to myself]: Who knows, perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will be gracious to me, and the child will live!"
Ii Samuel 12:23,"But now he is dead—why, then, should I fast?
Can I make him return again?
I may go to him,
but he will not return to me."
Ii Samuel 12:24,"David comforted Bat-Sheva his wife;
he came to her and lay with her,
and she bore a son and called his name Shelomo/Peace."
Ii Samuel 12:25,"Now Y<small>HWH</small> loved him, and he sent by the hand of Natan the Prophet;
he called his name Yedidya, by the grace of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Samuel 12:26,Yoav waged battle against Rabba of the Children of Ammon and captured the royal city;
Ii Samuel 12:27,"then Yoav sent mesengers to David
and said:
I have waged battle against Rabba;
I have also captured the water city."
Ii Samuel 12:28,"So-now,
gather the rest of the fighting-people and encamp against the city, and capture it,
lest I myself take the city, and my own name be called over it!"
Ii Samuel 12:29,"So David gathered all the fighting-people and went to Rabba;
he waged battle against it and captured it."
Ii Samuel 12:30,"Then he took their king’s crown from off his head
—its weight was a talent of gold, with a precious stone—
and it was [put] on David’s head,
while the spoils of the city he brought out, exceedingly much."
Ii Samuel 12:31,"As for the people who were in it, he brought them out and set [them to work] with the saw, and with picks of bronze, and with axes of bronze,
and had them pass through the brick-kiln.
Thus he would do with all the towns of the Children of Ammon.
Then David and all the fighting-people returned to Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 13:1,"It was [some time] after this:
now Avshalom son of David had a beautiful sister—her name was Tamar,
and Amnon son of David fell in love with her."
Ii Samuel 13:2,"And Amnon was distressed to [the point of] being sick because of Tamar his sister
—indeed, she was a nubile-girl—
and it seemed impossible in Amnon’s eyes to do anything to her."
Ii Samuel 13:3,"Now Amnon had a friend—his name was Yonadav son of Shim’a, David’s brother,
and Yonadav was an exceedingly worldly-wise man."
Ii Samuel 13:4,"He said to him:
For-what-reason are you so haggard, O son of the king, morning after morning?
Won’t you tell me?
Amnon said to him:
Tamar—the sister—of Avshalom—my brother—I love!"
Ii Samuel 13:5,"Yehonadav said to him:
Lie down on your lying-place and feign-sickness,
and when your father comes to see you, say to him:
Now let Tamar my sister come
and nourish me with some food;
let her make the nourishment ready before my eyes, in order that I may see it,
and I will eat from her hand."
Ii Samuel 13:6,"So Amnon lay down and feigned-sickness,
and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king:
Now let Tamar my sister come
and heat two heartcakes before my eyes,
that I may be nourished from her hand."
Ii Samuel 13:7,"David sent [word] to Tamar, in the palace-house, saying:
Pray go to the house of Amnon your brother
and make him some nourishment."
Ii Samuel 13:8,"So Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, while he was lying down.
She took some dough, kneaded it, heated it before his eyes, and boiled the heartcakes;"
Ii Samuel 13:9,"then she took the pot and placed it before him,
but he refused to eat.
Amnon said:
Have everyone go out from me!
And everyone went out from him."
Ii Samuel 13:10,"Amnon said to Tamar:
Bring the nourishment into the inner-room, so that I may be nourished from your hand!
So Tamar took the heartcakes that she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother into the inner-room."
Ii Samuel 13:11,"She brought them close to him to eat,
but he overpowered her and said to her:
Come, lie with me, sister!"
Ii Samuel 13:12,"She said to him:
No, brother, don’t force me,
for such is not to be done in Israel—
don’t do this vile thing!"
Ii Samuel 13:13,"As for me, where would I take my disgrace?
And as for you, you would be like one of the vile ones in Israel!
So-now, just speak to the king—indeed, he will not withhold me from you!"
Ii Samuel 13:14,"But he would not hearken to her voice;
he overpowered her and forced her, and lay with her."
Ii Samuel 13:15,"Then Amnon hated her with an exceedingly great hatred—
indeed, greater was the hatred with which he hated her than the love with which he had loved her.
Amnon said to her:
Get up! Go!"
Ii Samuel 13:16,"She said to him:
About this great evil—more than the other thing that you did to me—sending me away … !
But he would not hearken to her;"
Ii Samuel 13:17,"he called to his attending lad
and said:
Just send this one away from me, outside,
and lock the door behind her!"
Ii Samuel 13:18,"—Now on her was an ornamented tunic,
for thus were the king’s nubile daughters clothed in robes.—
So his attendant brought her outside, and locked the door behind her."
Ii Samuel 13:19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head,
while the ornamented tunic that was on her she tore;
she put her hands on her head
and went along, going along and crying out."
Ii Samuel 13:20,"Avshalom her brother said to her:
Has Amnon your brother been with you?
For now, sister, be silent—he is your brother;
do not take this thing to heart!
So Tamar stayed, desolate, in the house of Avshalom her brother."
Ii Samuel 13:21,"Now when King David heard about all these things,
he was exceedingly agitated."
Ii Samuel 13:22,"And Avshalom would not speak with Amnon, [anything] from evil to good,
for Avshalom hated Amnon over the fact that he had forced Tamar his sister."
Ii Samuel 13:23,"Now it was at two-years’ time
that they were shearing [sheep] for Avshalom in Baal Hatzor that is near Efrayim,
and Avshalom invited all the king’s sons."
Ii Samuel 13:24,"Avshalom came to the king
and said:
Now here, your servant is having shearing [done];
now let the king and his servants go with your servant."
Ii Samuel 13:25,"The king said to Avshalom:
No, my son, now we cannot go, all of us;
let us not weigh-heavily on you!
He pressed him, but he would not go,
and he gave him farewell-blessing."
Ii Samuel 13:26,"Avshalom said:
If not, now let Amnon my brother go with us.
The king said to him:
Why should he go with you?"
Ii Samuel 13:27,"But Avshalom pressed him,
so he sent Amnon with him, along with all the king’s sons."
Ii Samuel 13:28,"And Avshalom charged his serving-lads, saying:
Now take note: when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine,
and I say to you: Strike down Amnon!,
then put him to death—do not be afraid!
Have not I myself charged you?
Be strong, be valiant ones!"
Ii Samuel 13:29,"So Avshalom’s lads did to Amnon as Avshalom had charged,
and all the king’s sons arose and mounted each on his mule, and they fled."
Ii Samuel 13:30,"It was, when they were on the way,
that the rumor came to David, namely:
Avshalom has struck down all the king’s sons;
not one of them is left!"
Ii Samuel 13:31,"The king arose and tore his garments, and lay down on the ground,
while all his servants stood [over him] with torn garments."
Ii Samuel 13:32,"But Yonadav son of Shim’a, David’s brother, spoke up and said:
Let not my lord think that all the lads, the king’s sons,
have been put-to-death,
for Amnon alone has died;
for by Avshalom’s mouth it has been determined since the time of his forcing Tamar his sister."
Ii Samuel 13:33,"So-now,
do not let the king take the matter to heart, saying: All the king’s sons have died,
for Amnon alone has died,"
Ii Samuel 13:34,"and Avshalom has gotten away.
And the serving-lad standing watch lifted up his eyes and saw:
now here, many people were going away on the road behind him, from the side of the hill."
Ii Samuel 13:35,"Yonadav said to the king:
Here, the king’s sons have come;
exactly as your servant’s word, so it was!"
Ii Samuel 13:36,"And it was, when he finished speaking,
that here, the king’s sons came;
they lifted up their voices and wept,
and also the king and all his servants wept, an exceedingly great weeping."
Ii Samuel 13:37,"—Now Avshalom had gotten away;
he had gone to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur.—
And he mourned for his son all the days."
Ii Samuel 13:38,"Now Avshalom had gotten away and gone to Geshur,
and he was there for three years."
Ii Samuel 13:39,"Then the king’s spirit was spent for going out against Avshalom,
for he was consoled concerning Amnon, for he was dead."
Ii Samuel 14:1,"And Yoav son of Tzeruya knew
that the king’s heart was toward Avshalom,"
Ii Samuel 14:2,"so Yoav sent to Tekoa;
he fetched from there a worldly-wise woman
and said to her:
Pray feign-mourning, pray clothe yourself in garments of mourning;
do not pour oil [on yourself],
but be like a woman [who] these many days has been mourning over the dead."
Ii Samuel 14:3,"You are to come to the king
and are to speak to him according to these words …
And Yoav put the words in her mouth."
Ii Samuel 14:4,"So the Tekoite woman talked to the king:
she flung herself on her nostrils to the earth and bowed low,
and said:
Deliver [me], O king!"
Ii Samuel 14:5,"The king said to her:
What [ails] you?
She said:
Alas, I am a widow woman—my husband died."
Ii Samuel 14:6,"Now your handmaid had two sons,
but the two of them scuffled in the open-field, with no rescuer between them;
the one struck down the other-one and caused his death."
Ii Samuel 14:7,"And here, the whole clan has arisen against your handmaid and has said:
Give over the one who struck down his brother,
that we may put him to death for the life of his brother, whom he killed;
we want to destroy [him]! Even the heir!
So they will extinguish my ember that remains,
providing no name or survivor for my husband on the face of the earth."
Ii Samuel 14:8,"The king said to the woman:
Go back to your house,
and I myself will issue-a-command regarding you."
Ii Samuel 14:9,"The Tekoite woman said to the king:
On me, my lord king, be the iniquity, and on my Father’s House,
but the king and his throne are clear [of blame]."
Ii Samuel 14:10,"The king said:
The one who speaks [amiss] to you, have him brought to me—
he will not continue to harm you!"
Ii Samuel 14:11,"She said:
Pray let the king be mindful of Y<small>HWH</small> your God
—too much might the blood redeemer bring-ruin—
so that they do not destroy my son!
He said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
if a hair of your son should fall to the ground … !"
Ii Samuel 14:12,"Then the woman said:
Pray let your handmaid speak a word to my lord king.
He said:
Speak."
Ii Samuel 14:13,"The woman said:
Now why have you planned in this way against God’s people?
By the king speaking this word, [he is] as one guilty,
by not letting his banished one return."
Ii Samuel 14:14,"For we will die, yes, die,
like water running on the ground, which cannot be gathered up.
But God will not carry a life away;
he will plan plans, to not keep the banished one banished from him."
Ii Samuel 14:15,"So-now,
[the reason] that I have come to speak this word to the king, my lord,
is that the people made me afraid.
Your handmaid said [to herself]: Let me now speak to the king;
perhaps the king will act on his maidservant’s word."
Ii Samuel 14:16,"Indeed, the king will hearken
to rescue his maidservant from the grasp of the [avenging] man,
from destroying me and my son together, away from God’s inheritance."
Ii Samuel 14:17,"And your handmaid said [to herself]:
Now may the word of my lord king be for [my] rest,
for like a messenger of God, so is my lord king,
to hear out the good and the evil—
may Y<small>HWH</small> your God be with you!"
Ii Samuel 14:18,"The king answered, he said to the woman:
Do not conceal from me a thing that I ask of you!
The woman said:
Pray let my lord king speak."
Ii Samuel 14:19,"The king said:
Is the hand of Yoav with you in all this?
The woman answered and said:
By your life, my lord king,
there is no turning-right or turning-left from all that my lord king has spoken;
indeed, your servant Yoav himself commanded me—
he himself put in the mouth of your handmaid all these words."
Ii Samuel 14:20,"In order to reverse the face of the matter
did your servant Yoav do this thing;
but my lord is wise,
like the wisdom of a messenger of God,
to know all that is on earth!"
Ii Samuel 14:21,"Then the king said to Yoav:
Here now, I have done this thing.
So go, return the lad Avshalom!"
Ii Samuel 14:22,"Yoav flung himself on his face to the ground and bowed low, and he blessed the king;
Yoav said:
Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord king,
[given] that the king has acted upon your servant’s word!"
Ii Samuel 14:23,"And Yoav arose and went to Geshur,
and he brought Avshalom to Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 14:24,"The king said:
Let him turn round to his house,
but my face he is not to see!
So Avshalom turned to his house,
but the king’s face he did not see."
Ii Samuel 14:25,"Now like Avshalom there was no man as beautiful throughout all Israel, so exceedingly to be praised;
from the sole of his foot to his crown,
there was no defect in him."
Ii Samuel 14:26,"When he shaved his head
—it used to be that at the end of the year, [every] year,
he would shave it, for it was heavy upon him and [he had] to shave it—
he would weigh the hair of his head: two hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights, by the king’s [weighing-]stone."
Ii Samuel 14:27,"And there were born to Avshalom three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar;
she was a woman beautiful of appearance."
Ii Samuel 14:28,"And Avshalom stayed in Jerusalem for two-years’ time,
but the king’s face he did not see."
Ii Samuel 14:29,"So Avshalom sent to Yoav, to send him to the king,
but he would not come to him.
He sent again, a second-time,
but he would not come."
Ii Samuel 14:30,"So he said to his servants:
See, Yoav’s plot is near me, and he has barley there;
go, kindle it with fire!
And Avshalom’s servants kindled the plot with fire."
Ii Samuel 14:31,"And Yoav arose and came to Avshalom at the house;
he said to him:
Why did your servants kindle the plot that belongs to me with fire?"
Ii Samuel 14:32,"Avshalom said to Yoav:
Here, I had sent [word] to you, saying:
Come here, I wish to send you to the king, to say:
Why did I come back from Geshur?
It would have been better for me [if] I were still there!
So-now,
let me see the king’s face,
and if there be any iniquity in me, let him put me to death!"
Ii Samuel 14:33,"So Yoav came to the king and told him,
and he called for Avshalom;
he came to the king and bowed low to him, on his nostrils to the earth, before the king,
and the king kissed Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 15:1,"It was, [some time] after this,
that Avshalom prepared himself a chariot and horses,
with fifty men running before him."
Ii Samuel 15:2,"And Avshalom would start-early;
he would stand by the road of the main-gate,
and it was that everyone who had a case-for-quarrel coming before the king, for judgment,
Avshalom would call to him, and would say:
From what town are you?
And he would say:
From a certain one of the tribes of Israel is your servant."
Ii Samuel 15:3,"Then Avshalom would say to him:
See, your words are good and correct,
but you have no one to hear on the part of the king!"
Ii Samuel 15:4,"And Avshalom said:
O who would make me judge in the land,
[that] every man might come to me who had a case-for-quarrel or a matter-for-judgment
—I would declare him in the right!"
Ii Samuel 15:5,"So it would be, when a man would come near, to bow low to him,
that he would stretch out his hand and take hold of him, and kiss him."
Ii Samuel 15:6,"And Avshalom did according to this matter for all Israel who would come for adjudication to the king;
thus Avshalom stole away the heart of the men of Israel."
Ii Samuel 15:7,"It was at the end of four years, that Avshalom said to the king:
Now let me go, that I may pay my vow that I vowed to Y<small>HWH</small> in Hevron,"
Ii Samuel 15:8,"for your servant vowed a vow when I stayed at Geshur in Aram, saying:
If Y<small>HWH</small> will let me return, yes, return to Jerusalem,
I will serve Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Samuel 15:9,"The king said to him:
Go in peace.
So he arose and went to Hevron."
Ii Samuel 15:10,"And Avshalom sent spy-runners throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying:
When you hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i>, you are to say:
Avshalom reigns as king in Hevron!"
Ii Samuel 15:11,"Now with Avshalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem,
invited-guests, going in their innocence—
they did not know anything."
Ii Samuel 15:12,"And Avshalom sent for Ahitofel the Gilonite, David’s adviser, from his town, from Gilo,
when he was sacrificing sacrifices.
Now the banding-in-conspiracy was powerful,
and the people with Avshalom went on [and on] becoming many."
Ii Samuel 15:13,"And a message-teller came to David, saying:
The heart of the men of Israel [inclines] after Avshalom!"
Ii Samuel 15:14,"So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem:
Arise, let us get away,
for we will have no remnant [left] before Avshalom!
Hurry and go,
lest he hurry and overtake us and push evil upon us
and strike the city with the mouth of the sword!"
Ii Samuel 15:15,"The king’s servants said to the king:
Just as my lord king chooses, here are your servants!"
Ii Samuel 15:16,"So the king and all his household went off on foot,
and the king left ten concubine women to guard the palace-house."
Ii Samuel 15:17,"And when the king and all the fighting-people went off on foot,
they stopped at the Far House."
Ii Samuel 15:18,"Now all his servants were crossing over next to him,
while all the Kereitites and all the Peleitites and all the Gittites,
six hundred men who came on foot from Gat,
were crossing over in front of the king."
Ii Samuel 15:19,"The king said to Ittai the Gittite:
Why will you go, even you, with us?
Return and stay with the king,
for you are a foreigner, and also you are an exile from your [own] place."
Ii Samuel 15:20,"[Just] yesterday was your coming,
so today, should I make you wander with us, in [our] going-forth?
I am going wherever I am going;
return, and have your brothers return with you,
in loyalty and faithfulness!"
Ii Samuel 15:21,"Ittai answered the king, he said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> lives and by the life of my lord king,
only in the place where my lord king is, whether for death or for life—
indeed, there your servant will be!"
Ii Samuel 15:22,"David said to Ittai:
Go, cross over!
So Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the families who were with him crossed over."
Ii Samuel 15:23,"Now the entire region was weeping in a great voice while all the fighting-people were crossing over,
while the king was crossing Wadi Kidron,
and while all the fighting-people were crossing over, facing the road to the wilderness."
Ii Samuel 15:24,"And here: also Tzadok and all the Levites with him were carrying the Coffer of the Covenant of God;
they set down the Coffer of God, and Evyatar also went up,
until all the people had completed crossing away from the city."
Ii Samuel 15:25,"The king said to Tzadok:
Return the Coffer of God to the city;
if I find favor in Y<small>HWH</small>’s eyes,
he will let me return and let me see it, along with his abode."
Ii Samuel 15:26,"If thus he says: I am not pleased with you,
here I am—
let him do with me as is good in his eyes."
Ii Samuel 15:27,"And the king said [further] to Tzadok the priest:
Are you a seer?
Return to the city in peace,
along with Ahimaatz your son and Yehonatan son of Evyatar
—your two sons with you [both]."
Ii Samuel 15:28,"See, I myself will tarry at the plains in the wilderness
until word comes from you, telling me [something]."
Ii Samuel 15:29,"So Tzadok and Evyatar returned the Coffer of God to Jerusalem,
and they stayed there."
Ii Samuel 15:30,"But David was going up the Ascent of Olives, going up and weeping;
his head was covered and he was walking barefoot,
while all the people who were with him covered each one his head,
and were going up, going up and weeping."
Ii Samuel 15:31,"Now David was told, saying:
Ahitofel is among those banding together with Avshalom!
David said:
Pray make-foolish Ahitofel’s advice, O Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Samuel 15:32,"Now it was, when David was coming to the summit, where [they] would bow down to God,
that here, [coming] to meet him was Hushai the Arkite, his tunic torn and earth on his head."
Ii Samuel 15:33,"David said to him:
If you cross over with me,
you will be a burden to me,"
Ii Samuel 15:34,"but if you return to the city
and say to Avshalom: Your servant O king, will I be—
servant to your father was I formerly,
but now I am your servant!—
then you may annul Ahitofel’s advice for me."
Ii Samuel 15:35,"Will not Tzadok and Evyatar, the priests, be with you there?
It will be
that all the words that you hear from the king’s house, you are to tell to Tzadok and Evyatar the priests;"
Ii Samuel 15:36,"here, their two sons, Ahimaatz of Tzadok and Yehonatan of Evyatar, are there with them;
you are to send by their hand to me any word that you hear."
Ii Samuel 15:37,"So Hushai the Friend of David entered the city
[just] as Avshalom was about to enter Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 16:1,"Now David had crossed a little beyond the summit
when here: Tziva, Mefiboshet’s retainer, [was coming] to meet him,
along with a brace of saddled donkeys,
and on them were two hundred bread-loaves, a hundred raisin-cakes, a hundred fig-cakes, and a skin of wine."
Ii Samuel 16:2,"The king said to Tziva:
What do you [mean] with these?
Tziva said:
The donkeys are for the king’s household, for riding,
the bread and the figs are for eating by the lads,
and the wine is for drinking by those weary in the wilderness."
Ii Samuel 16:3,"The king said:
And where is your lord’s son?
Tziva said to the king:
Here, he is sitting in Jerusalem,
for he says [to himself]: Today the House of Israel will return my father’s kingdom to me!"
Ii Samuel 16:4,"The king said to Tziva:
Here, yours is all that was Mefiboshet’s.
Tziva said:
I bow down!
May I find favor in your eyes, O my lord king!"
Ii Samuel 16:5,"Now when King David came to Bahurim,
here, a man was going out from there, from the clan of the House of Sha’ul;
his name was Shim’i son of Gera.
He was going out, going out and cursing—"
Ii Samuel 16:6,"and he pelted David with stones, and all of King David’s court-servants,
along with all the fighting-people and all the mighty-men to his right and to his left."
Ii Samuel 16:7,"And thus did Shim’i say when he cursed him:
Get out, get out, [you] bloodguilty man, [you] base man!"
Ii Samuel 16:8,"Y<small>HWH</small> has returned upon you all the bloodguilt of the House of Sha’ul, in whose place you reign as king,
and Y<small>HWH</small> has given the kingdom into the hand of Avshalom your son,
for here, you are in your evil-fate,
for you are a bloodguilty man!"
Ii Samuel 16:9,"Avishai son of Tzeruya said to the king:
Why should this dead dog curse my lord king?
Now let me cross over and take off his head!"
Ii Samuel 16:10,"But the king said:
What is there [in common] between me and you, O sons of Tzeruya?
Let him curse, for if Y<small>HWH</small> says to him: Curse David,
who is to say: For-what-reason do you do thus?"
Ii Samuel 16:11,"And David said to Avishai and to all his servants:
Here, my [own] son, who came out of my body, is seeking my life;
how much more, then, the Binyaminite!
Let him be, that he may curse,
for Y<small>HWH</small> told him to."
Ii Samuel 16:12,"Perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will look on my affliction
and Y<small>HWH</small> will return me good in place of his curses on this day!"
Ii Samuel 16:13,"David and his men went on the way;
but Shim’i was going along the side of the hill, next to him,
going along and cursing and pelting [him] with stones next to him
and dumping dust [on him]."
Ii Samuel 16:14,"And the king and all the people that were with him came back weary,
and they paused-for-breath there."
Ii Samuel 16:15,"Now Avshalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
and Ahitofel was with him."
Ii Samuel 16:16,"And it was, when Hushai the Arkite, David’s Friend, came to Avshalom,
that Hushai said to Avshalom:
May the king live! May the king live!"
Ii Samuel 16:17,"Avshalom said to Hushai:
Is this your loyalty to your friend?
Why didn’t you go with your friend?"
Ii Samuel 16:18,"Hushai said to Avshalom:
No—
rather, the one whom Y<small>HWH</small> and his people, all the men of Israel, have chosen,
for him I will be, and with him I will stay!"
Ii Samuel 16:19,"And second, whom should I serve, if not in the presence of his son?
As I served in the presence of your father,
so I will serve in your presence."
Ii Samuel 16:20,"Avshalom said to Ahitofel:
Give advice, [both of] you—
what should we do?"
Ii Samuel 16:21,"Ahitofel said to Avshalom:
Come in to your father’s concubines, whom he left to guard the palace-house;
when all Israel hears that you have made yourself reek to your father,
then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened."
Ii Samuel 16:22,"So they spread out a tent for Avshalom on the roof,
and Avshalom came in to his father’s concubines, before the eyes of all Israel."
Ii Samuel 16:23,"Now the advice of Ahitofel which he advised
was in those days like inquiring of the word of God;
thus was all of Ahitofel’s advice, so for David, so for Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 17:1,"Ahitofel said to Avshalom:
Pray let me choose twelve thousand men,
and let me arise and pursue after David tonight."
Ii Samuel 17:2,"When I come upon him
and he is weary and slack of hands,
I will alarm him,
so that all the people that are with him will flee.
Then I will strike down the king alone,"
Ii Samuel 17:3,"and I will return all the people to you,
[so that] when all are returned
—the man whom you seek and all the fighting-people—
there will be peace."
Ii Samuel 17:4,"The word was right in Avshalom’s eyes
and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel."
Ii Samuel 17:5,"But Avshalom said:
Pray call as well Hushai the Arkite;
we will hear what is in his mouth, his as well."
Ii Samuel 17:6,"And Hushai came to Avshalom, and Avshalom said to him, saying:
In accordance with this word did Ahitofel speak;
shall we act on his word?
Or not? <i>You</i> speak!"
Ii Samuel 17:7,"Hushai said to Avshalom:
Not good is the advice that Ahitofel has advised this time."
Ii Samuel 17:8,"And Hushai said [further]:
You yourself know your father and his men,
that they are mighty ones,
and that they are bitter of feelings,
like a bear bereaved in the open-field,
and your father is a man of battle—
he will not spend-the-night with the people."
Ii Samuel 17:9,"Here now,
he is hiding in one of the pits or in one of the halting-places;
and it will be
when fighting-people fall at the start [of battle],
and a hearer hears and says:
There has been a defeat for the people who [follow] after Avshalom—"
Ii Samuel 17:10,"that even if he be a valiant one,
whose heart is like the heart of a lion,
he will melt, melt away [in fear].
For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty-man,
and valiant ones are with him!"
Ii Samuel 17:11,"So I advise:
let all Israel be gathered, yes, gathered to you, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,
like the sand that is by the sea in abundance,
with your presence walking among them."
Ii Samuel 17:12,"We will come upon him
in one of the places where he can be found,
and light upon him as dew falls upon the ground;
there will not be left to him, or to all the men that are with him, even one."
Ii Samuel 17:13,"Now if he gathers himself into a town,
then let all Israel bring ropes into that town
and let us drag it, as far as the wadi, until even a pebble cannot be found there!"
Ii Samuel 17:14,"Avshalom and all Israel said:
Better is the advice of Hushai the Arkite than the advice of Ahitofel!
—Now Y<small>HWH</small> had ordained to nullify the good advice of Ahitofel,
in order that Y<small>HWH</small> might bring an evil-fate upon Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 17:15,"And Hushai said to Tzadok and to Evyatar, the priests:
Like this and like that, Ahitofel advised Avshalom and the elders of Israel,
and like this and like that, I myself advised."
Ii Samuel 17:16,"So-now,
send quickly and tell David, saying:
Do not lodge tonight at the wilderness crossings,
by-all-means cross over, yes, cross over,
lest they be swallowed up, the king and all the people who are with him!"
Ii Samuel 17:17,"Now Yehonatan and Ahimaatz were staying at En-Rogel,
and a handmaid would go and tell them,
and they would go and tell King David,
for they could not be seen coming to the town."
Ii Samuel 17:18,"But a serving-lad saw them and told Avshalom,
so the two of them went quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim;
he had a well in his courtyard,
and they went down there."
Ii Samuel 17:19,"And the woman fetched and spread a screen over the mouth of the well,
and she scattered some groats over it,
so that nothing was noticeable."
Ii Samuel 17:20,"So when Avshalom’s servants came to the woman in the house,
and they said: Where are Ahimaatz and Yehonatan?
the woman said to them:
They have [already] crossed the pond of water.
They sought but did not find [them],
so they returned to Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 17:21,"Now it was, after their going away,
that they came up out of the well, and went and told King David;
they said to David:
Arise and quickly cross the water,
for thus-and-so has Ahitofel advised concerning you."
Ii Samuel 17:22,"So David arose, and all the people who were with him;
they crossed the Jordan, till the light of daybreak,
until there was no one left behind who had not crossed the Jordan."
Ii Samuel 17:23,"Now when Ahitofel saw that his advice had not been acted upon,
he saddled a donkey, and arose and went to his house, to his town;
and he gave charge regarding his household, and then he strangled himself, so that he died.
He was buried in the burial-place of his father."
Ii Samuel 17:24,"When David had come to Mahanayim, Avshalom crossed the
Jordan, he and all the fighting-men of Israel with him."
Ii Samuel 17:25,"As for Amasa, Avshalom put him in place of Yoav, [The One] Over the Armed-Forces
—Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Yitra the Yizre’elite,
who had come in to Avigayil daughter of Nahash, sister of Tzeruya, Yoav’s mother."
Ii Samuel 17:26,Now Israel and Avshalom encamped in the region of Gil’ad.
Ii Samuel 17:27,"And it was, when David came to Mahanayim,
that Shovi son of Nahash from Rabba of the Children of Ammon
and Makhir son of Ammiel from Lo-Devar and Barzillai the Gil’adite from Rogelim"
Ii Samuel 17:28,"brought forward couches and basins and potter’s vessels,
and wheat and barley and meal and parched-grain,
and beans and lentils,"
Ii Samuel 17:29,"and honey and curds and sheep and cheese from cattle for David
and for the people that were with him, to eat,
for they had said:
The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness!"
Ii Samuel 18:1,"And David counted [for battle] the fighting-people who were with him;
he put over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds."
Ii Samuel 18:2,"And David sent out the fighting-people:
a third in the hand of Yoav,
a third in the hand of Avishai son of Tzeruya, Yoav’s brother,
and a third in the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
The king said to the fighting-people:
I will go out, yes, go out, even I myself, with you!"
Ii Samuel 18:3,"But the people said:
You are not to go out,
for if we have to flee, yes, flee,
they will not take us to heart,
and [even] if half of us die,
they will not take us to heart;
but <i>you</i> are like us ten thousandfold!
So-now, it is better if you are [there] for us in the town, to provide-help."
Ii Samuel 18:4,"The king said to them:
Whatever is good in your eyes, I will do.
So the king stood by the gate,
while all the fighting-people went out by the hundreds and by the thousands."
Ii Samuel 18:5,"And the king charged Yoav and Avishai and Ittai, saying:
Go-gently for me on the lad, on Avshalom!
And all the people heard the charge of the king to all the commanders on the matter of Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 18:6,"The fighting-people went out into the open-country to meet Israel;
the battle occurred in the forest of Efrayim."
Ii Samuel 18:7,"And the fighting-people of Israel were defeated there, before David’s servants;
there occurred there a great defeat on that day—twenty thousand [dead]."
Ii Samuel 18:8,"And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the ground;
more did the forest devour among the fighting-people than the sword devoured on that day."
Ii Samuel 18:9,"And Avshalom chanced upon David’s servants:
Avshalom was riding on a mule,
and the mule came under the thick-boughs of a great oak,
and his head became held fast in the oak,
so that he was left hanging between heaven and earth,
while the mule that was under him crossed on."
Ii Samuel 18:10,"A man saw it and told Yoav;
he said:
Here, I saw Avshalom hanging from an oak!"
Ii Samuel 18:11,"Yoav said to the man, the one telling him:
Now here, you saw [him]—
so for-what-reason didn’t you strike him down there to the ground?
I would have to have given you ten pieces-of-silver and a belt!"
Ii Samuel 18:12,"The man said to Yoav:
Even if I were feeling-the-weight in my palms of a thousand pieces-of-silver,
I would not stretch out my hand against the king’s son,
for it was in our ears that the king charged you and Avishai and Ittai, saying:
Guard the lad, Avshalom, for me!"
Ii Samuel 18:13,"Else I would have been dealing falsely with my own life,
for nothing is hidden from the king—
yet you, you were standing aloof!"
Ii Samuel 18:14,"Yoav said:
I will not wait around like this before you!
So he took three rods in his palm
and thrust them into Avshalom’s heart
—he was still alive in the heart of the oak."
Ii Samuel 18:15,"And ten fighting-lads, Yoav’s weapons bearers, surrounded him;
they struck Avshalom and put him to death."
Ii Samuel 18:16,"Then Yoav sounded a thrusting-blast on the <i>shofar</i>,
so that the fighting-people turned back from pursuing after Israel,
for Yoav held back the people."
Ii Samuel 18:17,"They took Avshalom
and threw him in the forest, into a great pit,
and set up over him a heap of stones, exceedingly large,
while all Israel fled, each to his tent."
Ii Samuel 18:18,"Now Avshalom had undertaken to set up for himself, during
his lifetime, the standing-stone that is in the King’s Valley,
for he had said [to himself]: I have no son through whom to have my name recalled.
So he called the standing-stone by his name—
it is called Avshalom’s Monument until this day."
Ii Samuel 18:19,"Now Ahimaatz son of Tzadok said:
Pray let me run and bring-the-news to the king
that Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought justice for him from the hand of his enemies!"
Ii Samuel 18:20,"Yoav said to him:
You are not to be a man of news on this day;
you may bring-news on another day,
but on this day, you are not to bring-news,
since the king’s son is dead."
Ii Samuel 18:21,"Yoav said to a Cushite:
Go, tell the king what you have seen.
The Cushite bowed low to Yoav and ran off."
Ii Samuel 18:22,"But once again Ahimaatz son of Tzadok said to Yoav:
Come what may, pray let me run, me too, after the Cushite.
Yoav said:
Why should you run, my son,
when you have no news [that] will find [you favor]?"
Ii Samuel 18:23,"… Come what may, I want to run!
So he said to him: Run!
And Ahimaatz ran by way of the Oval, and passed the Cushite."
Ii Samuel 18:24,"Now David was sitting between the two gateways,
and the watchman on the roof of the gate went over to the [city] wall;
he lifted up his eyes and saw: here, a man was running alone."
Ii Samuel 18:25,"The watchman called out and told the king,
and the king said:
If he is alone, [there is] news in his mouth.
And he went, going along and coming nearer,"
Ii Samuel 18:26,"but the watchman saw another man running;
the watchman called out to the gatekeeper
and said:
Here, [another] man is running alone!
The king said:
This one too is bringing-news."
Ii Samuel 18:27,"The watchman said:
I see [that] the running of the first-one is like the running of Ahimaatz son of Tzadok.
The king said:
He is a good man, and with good news he comes!"
Ii Samuel 18:28,"Ahimaatz called out and said to the king: Peace!
And he bowed low to the king, his nostrils to the ground,
and said:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
who has turned over the men who lifted their hand against my lord king!"
Ii Samuel 18:29,"The king said:
Is there peace with the lad, with Avshalom?
Ahimaatz said:
I saw a great commotion when Yoav sent off the king’s servant and your servant,
but I do not know what [it was]."
Ii Samuel 18:30,"The king said:
Turn around, station yourself here.
He turned around and stopped."
Ii Samuel 18:31,"And here, the Cushite came,
and the Cushite said:
Let my lord king receive-the-news
that Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought justice for you today from the hand of all those rising against you!"
Ii Samuel 18:32,"The king said to the Cushite:
Is there peace with the lad, with Avshalom?
The Cushite said:
May they be like that lad, my lord king’s enemies and all those who have risen against you for evil!"
Ii Samuel 19:1,"The king was shaken;
he went up to the upper-part of the gate and wept,
and thus he said as he went:
My son Avshalom,
my son, my son Avshalom!
Who will grant my dying, myself, in your place?
Avshalom, my son, my son!"
Ii Samuel 19:2,"And it was told to Yoav:
Here, the king is weeping and mourning over Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 19:3,"Now the victory became mourning on that day for all the people,
for the people heard on that day, saying:
The king is in pain over his son."
Ii Samuel 19:4,"So the people stole away on that day, while coming into the city
as humiliated fighting-people steal away when they flee in battle."
Ii Samuel 19:5,"Now the king wrapped his face,
and the king cried out in a loud voice:
My son Avshalom,
Avshalom, my son, my son!"
Ii Samuel 19:6,"Yoav came to the king in the palace-house,
and said:
Today you have shamed the face of all your servants
who helped you escape with your life today
and the life of your sons and your daughters, and the life of your wives, and the life of your concubines—"
Ii Samuel 19:7,"by loving those-who-hate-you, and by hating those-who-love-you!
For you have declared today that you have no commanders or servants;
for today I know that if Avshalom were alive, and all of us today were dead,
indeed, then it would be right in your eyes!"
Ii Samuel 19:8,"So-now, get up, go out
and speak to the heart of your servants,
for by Y<small>HWH</small> I swear, that [if] you do not go out,
no man will lodge with you tonight,
and this will be more evil for you
than all the evils that have come upon you from your youth until now!"
Ii Samuel 19:9,"So the king got up and sat at the gate,
while to all the people they declared, saying:
Here, the king is sitting at the gate!
And all the people came before the king.
Now Israel had fled, each one to his tent;"
Ii Samuel 19:10,"and it was that all the people were in strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying:
The king rescued us from the hand of our enemies,
and he himself helped us escape from the hand of the Philistines;
but now he had to run away from the land, from Avshalom,"
Ii Samuel 19:11,"while Avshalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle!
So-now,
why are you keeping silent about having the king return?"
Ii Samuel 19:12,"Now King David sent to Tzadok and Evyatar the priests, saying:
Speak to the elders of Judah, saying:
Why should you be the last to return the king to his house?
—For the words of all Israel had come to the king, to his house.—"
Ii Samuel 19:13,"You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh;
so why should you be the last to return the king?"
Ii Samuel 19:14,"And to Amasa, say:
Are you not my bone and my flesh?
Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add,
if you do not become commander of the armed-forces before me all the days [to come], in place of Yoav."
Ii Samuel 19:15,"Thus he inclined the heart of all the men of Judah, as one man;
they sent [word] to the king:
Return, you and all your servants!"
Ii Samuel 19:16,"So the king returned and came to the Jordan,
while Judah came to Gilgal to go and meet the king,
to conduct the king across the Jordan."
Ii Samuel 19:17,"And Shim’i son of Gera, the Binyaminite who was from Bahurim, hurried out;
he went down with the men of Judah to meet King David,"
Ii Samuel 19:18,"and a thousand men were with him from Binyamin,
along with Tziva, the retainer from the House of Sha’ul,
and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him;
they advanced to the Jordan ahead of the king,"
Ii Samuel 19:19,"while the river-crossing was being crossed, in order to conduct the king’s household across,
to do what was good in his eyes.
Now Shim’i son of Gera flung himself down before the king, as he was crossing the Jordan;"
Ii Samuel 19:20,"he said to the king:
Do not impute iniquity to me, my lord,
do not call-to-mind what your servant iniquitously-did on the day that my lord king went out from Jerusalem,
that the king should take it to heart!"
Ii Samuel 19:21,"For your servant knows that I myself sinned,
but here: I have come today, as the first of the entire House of Yosef,
going down to meet my lord king!"
Ii Samuel 19:22,"Avishai son of Tzeruya spoke up and said:
For that, should not Shim’i be put to death?
Indeed, he cursed Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one!"
Ii Samuel 19:23,"David said:
What is there between me and you, O sons of Tzeruya,
that you have become an adversary to me?
Today should a man be put to death in Israel?
Indeed, do I not know that today I am king over Israel?"
Ii Samuel 19:24,"The king said to Shim’i:
You will not die!
And the king swore-an-oath to him."
Ii Samuel 19:25,"Now Mefiboshet [grand]son of Sha’ul went down to meet the king
—he had not done his toenails, he had not done his mustache,
and his garments he had not scrubbed,
from the day of the king’s going away until the day that he came back in peace—"
Ii Samuel 19:26,"and it was, when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king
that the king said to him:
Why did you not go with me, Mefiboshet?"
Ii Samuel 19:27,"He said:
My lord king, my servant deceived me;
for your servant said [to himself]:
I will have my donkey saddled and ride it, and I will go to the king—
though your servant is lame."
Ii Samuel 19:28,"But he slandered your servant to my lord king;
yet my lord king is like a messenger of God—
so do as is good in your eyes."
Ii Samuel 19:29,"For all my father’s household were nothing but men [deserving] death from my lord king;
yet you have set your servant among those eating at your table!
So what right do I still have to cry out to the king?"
Ii Samuel 19:30,"The king said to him:
Why are you still speaking your words?
I have decided:
you and Tziva are to divide the fielded-property."
Ii Samuel 19:31,"Mefiboshet said to the king:
Let him just take all of it,
seeing that my lord has come back in peace to his house!"
Ii Samuel 19:32,"Now Barzillai the Gil’adite had come down from Rogelim
and had crossed the Jordan with the king, to send him off at the Jordan."
Ii Samuel 19:33,"And Barzillai was exceedingly old, at eighty years;
he had provided for the king when he had stayed at Mahanayim,
for he was a man of exceedingly great-wealth."
Ii Samuel 19:34,"The king said to Barzillai:
You, cross over with me, and I will provide for you beside me in Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 19:35,"But Barzillai said to the king:
How many [more] are the days and years of my life,
that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
Ii Samuel 19:36,"I am eighty years old today;
do I know between good and evil?
Or does your servant taste what I eat or what I drink?
Or do I still hearken to the voice of male-singers or female-singers?
So why should your servant still be a burden to my lord king?"
Ii Samuel 19:37,"Scarcely could your servant cross the Jordan with the king,
so why does the king reward me with this reward?"
Ii Samuel 19:38,"Now let your servant return, that I may die in my town,
beside the burial-place of my father and my mother.
But here is your servant Kimham—
let him cross over with my lord king,
and then do for him that which is good in your eyes."
Ii Samuel 19:39,"The king said:
With me, Kimham shall cross,
and I myself will do for him what is good in your eyes;
whatever you choose for me, I will do for you!"
Ii Samuel 19:40,"So all the fighting-people crossed the Jordan,
and when the king was about to cross over,
the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him,
and he returned to his place."
Ii Samuel 19:41,"Then the king crossed over to Gilgal, and Kimham crossed over with him.
Now all the fighting-people of Judah had conducted the king across,
and also half the fighting-people of Israel."
Ii Samuel 19:42,"And here, all the men of Israel were coming to the king;
they said to the king:
Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, stolen you away
and conducted the king and his household across the Jordan,
and all of David’s men with him?"
Ii Samuel 19:43,"All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel:
Because the king is closely-related to me!
Why are you so agitated about this matter?
Have we eaten, yes, eaten any of the king[’s food]?
Or has any been carried, yes, carried off to us?"
Ii Samuel 19:44,"The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, they said:
I have ten shares in the king,
yes, in David, I more than you;
so why do you insult me?
Was not my word, mine, the first for having my king return?
But the words of Judah’s men were rougher than the words of Israel’s men."
Ii Samuel 20:1,"Now there chanced to be a base man there—his name was Sheva son of Bikhri, a Binyaminite man;
he gave-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i> and said:
We have no portion in David,
nor inheritance for us in the son of Yishai;
everyone to his tents, O Israel!"
Ii Samuel 20:2,"So all the men of Israel went up from [following] after David, [to following] after Sheva son of Bikhri,
while the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 20:3,"And David came to his palace-house in Jerusalem.
The king took the ten concubine women whom he had left to guard the house
and put them in a house under guard and provided for them,
but he did not come in to them,
for they were tied off until the day of their death in living widowhood."
Ii Samuel 20:4,"Then the king said to Amasa:
Summon to me the men of Judah, in three days,
then you—stop here."
Ii Samuel 20:5,"Amasa went to summon Judah,
but he delayed from the appointed-time that he had appointed."
Ii Samuel 20:6,"And David said to Avishai:
Now,
Sheva son of Bikhri will be more evil for us than Avshalom!
So you, take your lord’s servants and pursue after him,
lest he find himself fortified towns, and cast-shadows over our eye!"
Ii Samuel 20:7,"So Yoav’s men went out after him,
with the Kereitites and the Peleitites and all the mighty-men;
they went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Sheva son of Bikhri."
Ii Samuel 20:8,"When they were beside the great rock that is in Giv’on,
Amasa came up in front of them.
Now Yoav was girded in his garb, his [military] dress,
and on him was a girded sword bound on his loins, in its sheath;
when he went out, it fell down."
Ii Samuel 20:9,"And Yoav said to Amasa:
Are you in peace, my brother?
And Yoav’s right hand took hold of Amasa’s beard, to kiss him,"
Ii Samuel 20:10,"but Amasa did not guard himself from the sword that was in Yoav’s [other] hand,
and he struck him with it in the abdomen, so that his innards poured out on the ground;
—he did not [have to] do it to him a second-time—and so he died.
Now Yoav and Avishai his brother pursued after Sheva son of Bikhri,"
Ii Samuel 20:11,"while a man was standing by him from the serving-lads of Yoav;
he said:
Whoever desires Yoav, and whoever is for David—[follow] after Yoav!"
Ii Samuel 20:12,"Now Amasa was rolling in blood in the middle of the road;
and the man saw that all the people were stopping,
so he turned Amasa over from the road into the open-field, and threw a garment over him
—when anyone who came by saw him, he would stop."
Ii Samuel 20:13,"When he had pushed him out of the road,
all the men who were [following] after Yoav crossed over to pursue after Sheva son of Bikhri."
Ii Samuel 20:14,"They crossed throughout all the tribes of Israel to Avel of Bet-Maakha, to all the Bikhrites,
and assembled and came just after him."
Ii Samuel 20:15,"They came and besieged him, in Avel of Bet-Maakha:
they cast up a mound against the town, and stopped at the rampart,
while all the fighting-people who were with Yoav were bringing-ruin, to cause the wall to fall."
Ii Samuel 20:16,"But a wise woman called out from the town:
Hearken! Hearken!
Now say to Yoav:
Come near to here—I would speak with you!"
Ii Samuel 20:17,"He came near to her.
The woman said:
Are you Yoav?
He said:
I am.
She said to him:
Hearken to the words of your maidservant.
He said:
I am hearkening."
Ii Samuel 20:18,"She said, saying:
They used to speak, yes, speak formerly, saying:
When they inquired, yes, inquired in Avel,
thus they ended [the matter]!"
Ii Samuel 20:19,"<i>I</i> [am of] those most at peace, most trustworthy in Israel;
<i>you</i> seek to deal death to a town, a mother-city in Israel!
Why would you swallow up Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance?"
Ii Samuel 20:20,"Yoav answered and said:
[Heaven] forbid, forbid for me, if I cause it to be swallowed up, if I bring-ruin!"
Ii Samuel 20:21,"Not so is the matter,
but a man from the highlands of Efrayim, Sheva son of Bikhri his name,
has lifted his hand against the king, against David.
Give up him alone, and I will go from the town!
The woman said to Yoav:
Here, his head will be thrown to you by way of the wall."
Ii Samuel 20:22,"And the woman came to all the people with her wisdom,
and they cut off the head of Sheva son of Bikhri and threw it to Yoav;
then he sounded-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>,
and they scattered from the town, each one to his tents,
while Yoav returned to Jerusalem, to the king."
Ii Samuel 20:23,"Now Yoav was [The One] Over All the Armed-Forces of Israel,
while Benaya son of Yehoyada was [The One] Over the Kereitites and Over the Peleitites,"
Ii Samuel 20:24,"and Adoram was [The One] Over the Labor-Gangs,
and Yehoshafat son of Ahilud was the Herald,"
Ii Samuel 20:25,"and Sh’va was Scribe,
and Tzadok and Evyatar were priests,
while also ’Ira the Ya’irite was priest to David."
Ii Samuel 21:1,"Now there was a famine in David’s days, for three years, year after year,
and David besought the face of Y<small>HWH</small>.
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Because of Sha’ul and because of the House of Bloodguilt,
because he caused the death of the Giv’onites … !"
Ii Samuel 21:2,"So the king called for the Giv’onites and said to them
—now the Giv’onites were not from the Children of Israel,
but rather from the remnant of the Amorites,
yet the Children of Israel had sworn [an oath] to them;
but Sha’ul had sought to strike them down, in his zeal for the Children of Israel and Judah—"
Ii Samuel 21:3,"David said to the Giv’onites:
What shall I do for you?
In what [way] may I effect-atonement,
so that they may bless Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance?"
Ii Samuel 21:4,"The Giv’onites said to him:
We have no [wish for] silver or gold with Sha’ul or with his house,
and we have no [wish to] put any man to death in Israel!
He said:
Whatever you say, I will do for you."
Ii Samuel 21:5,"They said to the king:
The man who [wanted to] destroy us,
who intended for us [that] we should be wiped out from remaining in all the territory of Israel:"
Ii Samuel 21:6,"let there be given to us seven men of his descendants,
and we will impale them to Y<small>HWH</small> at Giv’a of Sha’ul, the chosen one of Y<small>HWH</small>!
The king said:
I myself will give [them over]."
Ii Samuel 21:7,"But the king spared Mefiboshet son of Yehonatan son of Sha’ul,
because of the sworn-oath of Y<small>HWH</small> that was between them, between David and Yehonatan son of Sha’ul."
Ii Samuel 21:8,"So the king took the two sons of Ritzpa daughter of Aya, whom she had borne to Sha’ul, Armoni and Mefiboshet,
and the five sons of Merav daughter of Sha’ul, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholatite,"
Ii Samuel 21:9,"and gave them into the hand of the Giv’onites;
they impaled them on the hill, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and the seven of them fell together.
—Now they were put to death at the time of the harvest, the first
days, at the start of the barley harvest.—"
Ii Samuel 21:10,"And Ritzpa daughter of Aya took sackcloth
and spread it out for herself on a rock
from the start of the harvest until water poured out on them from the heavens;
she did not allow the birds of the heavens to alight on them by day
or the wildlife of the open-field by night."
Ii Samuel 21:11,"And David was told what Ritzpa daughter of Aya, Sha’ul’s concubine, had done,"
Ii Samuel 21:12,"so David went
and took the bones of Sha’ul and the bones of Yehonatan his son from the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil’ad,
who had stealthily-taken them from the square of Bet-Shan,
where the Philistines had hung them up at the time that the Philistines struck down Sha’ul at Gilboa;"
Ii Samuel 21:13,"he brought up from there the bones of Sha’ul and the bones of Yehonatan his son,
and they gathered the bones of the impaled ones."
Ii Samuel 21:14,"Then they buried the bones of Sha’ul and of Yehonatan his son
in the land of Binyamin, in the side-chamber of the burial-place of Kish his father.
And when they had done all that the king had commanded them,
God let-himself-be-entreated for the land after that."
Ii Samuel 21:15,"Now there were battles again by the Philistines with Israel;
David went down, his servants with him,
and they did battle with the Philistines.
But David was weary,"
Ii Samuel 21:16,"and he was taken captive by Benov, who was of the descendants of the Shades
—the weight of his lance was three hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights of bronze,
while he was girded in new [armor]—
he intended to strike David down,"
Ii Samuel 21:17,"but Avishai son of Tzeruya came to his help:
he struck down the Philistine and put him to death.
Then David’s men swore [an oath] to him, saying:
You must not go out with us again into battle;
you must not extinguish the lamp of Israel!"
Ii Samuel 21:18,"It was [some time] after this
that there was battle again, in Gov, with the Philistines.
And Sibbekhai the Hushatite struck down Saf, who was of the descendants of the Shades."
Ii Samuel 21:19,"And there was battle again in Gov, with the Philistines,
and Elhanan son of Yaarei-Oregim the Bet-Lehemite struck down Golyat the Gittite
—now the shaft of his spear was like a weavers’ beam."
Ii Samuel 21:20,"And there was battle again in Gat:
and there was an immense man—
the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet were six and six [apiece], twenty-four in number,
and he too was descended from the Shades."
Ii Samuel 21:21,"He mocked Israel,
but Yehonatan son of Shim’a, David’s brother, struck him down."
Ii Samuel 21:22,"These four were descended from the Shades, in Gat;
they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants."
Ii Samuel 22:1,"And David spoke forth to Y<small>HWH</small> the words of this song
at the time that Y<small>HWH</small> rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Sha’ul;"
Ii Samuel 22:2,"he said:
Y<small>HWH</small> is my crag and my fortress, one helping me escape!"
Ii Samuel 22:3,"My God is my rock, in whom I seek-refuge,
my shield, the horn of my deliverance,
my secure-height, my place-of-retreat,
my deliverer—from treachery you deliver me!"
Ii Samuel 22:4,"Praised One I call Y<small>HWH</small>,
from my enemies I am delivered."
Ii Samuel 22:5,"For they encompassed me, the breakers of death,
the torrents of Belial tormented me;"
Ii Samuel 22:6,"the ropes of Sheol surrounded me,
they confronted me, the snares of death."
Ii Samuel 22:7,"In my distress I called Y<small>HWH</small>!
to my God I called.
He heard my voice from his Great-Hall,
my cry-for-deliverance in his ears."
Ii Samuel 22:8,"The earth did quake and shake,
the foundations of the heavens shuddered,
they quaked, because he was agitated;"
Ii Samuel 22:9,"smoke arose from his nostrils;
fire from his mouth, devouring,
coals burned forth from him."
Ii Samuel 22:10,"He spread the heavens and came down,
a heavy-cloud beneath his feet,"
Ii Samuel 22:11,"he mounted a winged-sphinx and flew,
he darted upon the wings of the wind."
Ii Samuel 22:12,"He set darkness all around him as his hut,
the [heavenly] sieve of water, in masses of clouds;"
Ii Samuel 22:13,"from the brightness in front of him
burned forth coals of fire."
Ii Samuel 22:14,"He thundered from the heavens, did Y<small>HWH</small>,
the Most-High gave forth his voice."
Ii Samuel 22:15,"He sent forth arrows and scattered them,
lightning and he panicked them."
Ii Samuel 22:16,"Then appeared the sources of the sea,
revealed, the foundations of the earth,
at your rebuke, O Y<small>HWH</small>,
at the breath of his nostrils’ rush."
Ii Samuel 22:17,"He stretched out [his hand] from on high and took me,
he drew me out of mighty waters."
Ii Samuel 22:18,"He rescued me from my enemies so fierce,
from those hating me, for they were mightier than I."
Ii Samuel 22:19,"They confronted me on the day of my calamity,
but Y<small>HWH</small> became support for me."
Ii Samuel 22:20,"He brought me out to a wide-place,
he saved me because he was pleased with me."
Ii Samuel 22:21,"Y<small>HWH</small> rewarded me according to my righteousness,
according to the purity of my hands, he paid me back."
Ii Samuel 22:22,"For I have kept the ways of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and have done no wrong in the presence of my God."
Ii Samuel 22:23,"For all his regulations are before me,
his laws I have not turned aside from me;"
Ii Samuel 22:24,"I have been wholehearted with him,
I have kept myself from iniquity."
Ii Samuel 22:25,"Y<small>HWH</small> has paid me back according to my innocence,
according to my purity before his eyes."
Ii Samuel 22:26,"With the loyal ones you are loyal,
with the wholehearted mighty-man you are whole,"
Ii Samuel 22:27,"with the pure one you are pure,
but with the crooked you are devious."
Ii Samuel 22:28,"An afflicted people you will deliver,
but the haughty-eyed you will bring low."
Ii Samuel 22:29,"Yes, you are my lamp, O Y<small>HWH</small>,
my God brightens my darkness."
Ii Samuel 22:30,"Yes, with you I assault a troop,
with my God I can leap over a wall."
Ii Samuel 22:31,"This God, whole is his way,
the word of Y<small>HWH</small> is tested,
a shield is he for all who take refuge in him."
Ii Samuel 22:32,"For who is God besides Y<small>HWH</small>?
Who is a rock besides our God?"
Ii Samuel 22:33,"God encompasses me with might,
he makes wholeness his way."
Ii Samuel 22:34,"He sets my feet like [those of] deer,
on my heights he makes me stand."
Ii Samuel 22:35,"Training my hands for battle,
my arms to stretch a bow of bronze."
Ii Samuel 22:36,"You have given me your shield of deliverance,
your battle-cry makes-me-many."
Ii Samuel 22:37,"You have widened my steps under me,
my ankles do not slip."
Ii Samuel 22:38,"I pursue my enemies, I destroy them,
I do not turn back until they are finished."
Ii Samuel 22:39,"I batter them and shatter them, so that they rise no more,
they fall beneath my feet."
Ii Samuel 22:40,"You have armed me with might for battle,
bowed my adversaries beneath me."
Ii Samuel 22:41,"As for my enemies, you have given me their necks,
those hating me—I annihilate them."
Ii Samuel 22:42,"They cried-for-help, but there was no deliverer,
to Y<small>HWH</small>, but he did not answer them."
Ii Samuel 22:43,"I crush-them-fine like the dust of the ground,
like the dirt of the streets I pulverize them, I pound them!"
Ii Samuel 22:44,"You have saved me from my people’s strife,
you have guarded me as the head of nations;
a people unknown to me serves me,"
Ii Samuel 22:45,"foreigners come-fawning to me,
hearing by the ear, they hearken to me."
Ii Samuel 22:46,"Foreigners crumble,
they emerge from their enclosures."
Ii Samuel 22:47,"By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, blessed is my rock,
exalted is my God, the rock of my deliverance;"
Ii Samuel 22:48,"the God giving me vengeance,
bringing down peoples under me,"
Ii Samuel 22:49,"taking me out from my enemies.
Over my adversaries you have exalted me,
from the man of violence you have rescued me."
Ii Samuel 22:50,"Therefore I praise you, O Y<small>HWH</small>, among the nations,
and to your name I sing-melodies,"
Ii Samuel 22:51,"[the One] who magnifies the victories of his king,
[the One] who shows loyalty to his anointed one,
to David and to his seed,
for the ages!"
Ii Samuel 23:1,"Now these are David’s last words:
Utterance of David the son of Yishai,
utterance of one on high raised up,
anointed one of Yaakov’s God,
favored one of Israel’s Strength:"
Ii Samuel 23:2,"the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> speaks through me,
his discourse is on my tongue."
Ii Samuel 23:3,"The God of Israel talks,
to me the Rock of Israel speaks:
A ruler over humans, a righteous one,
a ruler with the awe of God,"
Ii Samuel 23:4,"is like the light of daybreak as the sun rises,
a daybreak without clouds,
by dint of brightness, by dint of rain,
the herbage of the earth."
Ii Samuel 23:5,"—Yes, is not so my house before God?
For he has made me a covenant for the ages,
arranged in all and guarded!
Yes, all my deliverance, all my desire,
yes, will he not cause it to sprout?"
Ii Samuel 23:6,"But base ones:
like a thorn tossed away are all of them,
for not by [one’s] hand [alone] can they be taken up;"
Ii Samuel 23:7,"the man who touches them must fill [his hand] with iron or the shaft of a spear,
but with fire they will burn, yes, burn where [they] stay!"
Ii Samuel 23:8,"These are the names of the mighty-men belonging to David:
Yashav’am the Tahkemonite, head of the Three;
he swung his ax over eight hundred slain at one time."
Ii Samuel 23:9,"Now after him was El’azar son of Dodo son of Ahohi
—among the three mighty-men with David when they made-mockery of the Philistines gathered there for battle,
and the men of Israel went up."
Ii Samuel 23:10,"He arose and struck down the Philistines, until his hand became weary,
so that his hand stuck to the sword.
And Y<small>HWH</small> wrought a great victory on that day:
the fighting-people returned after him only to strip [the slain]."
Ii Samuel 23:11,"Now after him was Shamma son of Agei the Hararite;
[once,] the Philistines gathered at Lehi,
and there was a plot of open-field there full of lentils,
and when the people fled before the Philistines,"
Ii Samuel 23:12,"he took a stand amid the plot and rescued it, and struck down the Philistines.
Thus Y<small>HWH</small> wrought a great victory."
Ii Samuel 23:13,"[Once,] three of the Thirty chiefs went down, and they came at harvest-time to David at the Cave of Adullam,
while a troop of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of the Shades."
Ii Samuel 23:14,"Now David was then at the fortress,
while a garrison of Philistines was then at Bet-Lehem."
Ii Samuel 23:15,"And David had a craving, he said:
Who will give me water to drink from the cistern of Bet-Lehem that is at the gate?"
Ii Samuel 23:16,"The three mighty-men broke through into the camp of the Philistines
and drew water from the cistern of Bet-Lehem that is at the gate,
and carried it away and brought it to David.
But he would not drink it—he poured it out to Y<small>HWH</small>"
Ii Samuel 23:17,"and said:
[Heaven] forbid for me, by Y<small>HWH</small>, doing this;
is it the blood of men who were going forth [at risk] of their lives?!
And he would not drink it.
These [deeds] did the three mighty-men do."
Ii Samuel 23:18,"Now Avishai brother of Yoav son of Tzeruya was the head of the Thirty
—he swung his spear over three hundred slain,
and so he had a name among the Thirty."
Ii Samuel 23:19,"Among the Thirty he was honored, so that he became a commander for them,
but to the [status of the] Three he did not come."
Ii Samuel 23:20,"Now Benayahu son of Yehoyada, the son of a valiant man, was abundant in valiant-deeds, from Kavtze’el;
it was he [who] struck down the two [sons of] Ariel of Moav.
And he went down and struck a lion in the midst of a cistern, on a day of snow."
Ii Samuel 23:21,"It was he [who] struck an Egyptian man, a man of [giant] appearance,
—now in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear,"
Ii Samuel 23:22,"These [things] did Benayahu son of Yehoyada;
he had a name among the Thirty mighty-men."
Ii Samuel 23:23,"Among the Thirty he was honored,
but to the [status of the] Three he did not come.
And David put him over his bodyguard."
Ii Samuel 23:24,"Asa’el brother of Yoav was among the Thirty,
[with] Elhanan son of Dodo of Bet-Lehem,"
Ii Samuel 23:25,"Shamma the Harodite,
Elika the Harodite,"
Ii Samuel 23:26,"Heletz the Paltite,
Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,"
Ii Samuel 23:27,"Avi’ezer the Annatotite,
Mevunnai the Hushatite,"
Ii Samuel 23:28,"Tzalmon the Ahohite,
Mah’rai the Netofatite,"
Ii Samuel 23:29,"Helev son of Baana the Netofatite,
Ittai son of Rivai from Giv’a of the Children of Binyamin,"
Ii Samuel 23:30,"Benayahu [the] Pir’atonite,
Hiddai from the wadis of Gaash,"
Ii Samuel 23:31,"Avi-Almon the Arvatite,
Azmavet the Barhumite,"
Ii Samuel 23:32,"Elyahba the Shaalvonite,
the sons of Yashen, Yehonatan,"
Ii Samuel 23:33,"Ahi’am son of Sharar the Ararite,"
Ii Samuel 23:34,"Elifelet son of Ahasbai the Bet-Maakhatite,
Eli’am son of Ahitofel the Gilonite,"
Ii Samuel 23:35,"Hetzrai the Carmelite,
Paarai the Arbite,"
Ii Samuel 23:36,"Yig’al son of Natan of Tzova,
Bani the Gadite,"
Ii Samuel 23:37,"Tzeleg the Ammonite,
Nah’rai the Be’erotite, weapons bearer of Yoav son of Tzeruya,"
Ii Samuel 23:38,"Ira the Yitrite,
Garev the Yitrite,"
Ii Samuel 23:39,"Uriyya the Hittite—
altogether, thirty-seven."
Ii Samuel 24:1,"Once again Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against Israel,
and he incited David against them, saying:
Go, take-a-census of Israel and Judah."
Ii Samuel 24:2,"So the king said to Yoav, commander of the army that was with him:
Now roam throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,
and count the fighting-people,
that I may know the number of the people."
Ii Samuel 24:3,"Yoav said to the king:
May Y<small>HWH</small> your God add to the people, as [many as] they are, as [many as] they are, a hundredfold!
My lord king’s eyes can see it;
so my lord king—why does he desire this thing?"
Ii Samuel 24:4,"But the king’s word overpowered Yoav and the commanders of the fighting-forces,
so Yoav and the commanders of the forces went out from the king’s presence to count the people, Israel;"
Ii Samuel 24:5,"they crossed the Jordan and encamped in Aro’er, to the right/south of the town that is in the midst of the Wadi of Gad, toward Ya’zer,"
Ii Samuel 24:6,"then they came to Gil’ad and to the region of Tahtim-Hodshi,
then they came to Dan-Yaan and around to Sidon,"
Ii Samuel 24:7,"then they came to the fortress of Tyre and all the Hivvite and Canaanite towns,
and [finally] went out into the Negev of Judah, [toward] Be’er-Sheva."
Ii Samuel 24:8,"They roamed throughout the entire land
and came back at the end of nine months and twenty days to Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 24:9,"Yoav gave the number of the people thus-accounted to the king,
and Israel was: eight hundred thousand mighty-men of valor, drawing the sword,
and the men of Judah: five hundred thousand men."
Ii Samuel 24:10,"But David’s heart struck him after he had numbered the people,
and David said to Y<small>HWH</small>:
I have sinned exceedingly in what I have done!
So-now, O Y<small>HWH</small>, pray transfer the iniquity of your servant,
for I have been exceedingly foolish!"
Ii Samuel 24:11,"David arose at daybreak,
and the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Gad the prophet, David’s visionary, saying:"
Ii Samuel 24:12,"Go, you are to speak to David:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
I will hold three [things] over you;
choose yourself one of them, and I will do it to you."
Ii Samuel 24:13,"Gad came to David and told him;
he said to him:
Shall there come upon you seven years of famine in your land,
or three months of your fleeing before your foe, while he pursues you,
or shall there be three days of plague in your land?
So-now, know and take-note: what kind of word shall I answer to the one sending me?"
Ii Samuel 24:14,"David said to Gad:
I am in exceedingly great distress;
now let us fall into Y<small>HWH</small>’s hand,
for great is his compassion;
but into human hands may I never fall!"
Ii Samuel 24:15,"So Y<small>HWH</small> gave forth a plague among Israel, from morning until the appointed-time,
and there died of the people, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,
seventy thousand men."
Ii Samuel 24:16,"But when the [divine] messenger stretched forth his hand against Jerusalem, to bring-it-to-ruin,
Y<small>HWH</small> relented concerning the evil,
and he said to the messenger, the one bringing-ruin among the people:
Enough now, slacken your hand!
Now Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was beside the threshing-floor of Aravna the Yevusite."
Ii Samuel 24:17,"And David said to Y<small>HWH</small>, when he saw the messenger, the one striking down the people,
he said:
Here, it is I who have sinned,
it is I who have done-iniquity,
but these sheep, what have they done?
Pray let your hand be against me and against my Father’s House!"
Ii Samuel 24:18,"Gad came to David on that day
and said to him:
Go up, erect an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>
at the threshing-floor of Aravna the Yevusite."
Ii Samuel 24:19,"So David went up, according to the word of Gad, as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him."
Ii Samuel 24:20,"And Aravna looked out
and saw the king and his servants crossing over to him;
Aravna went out and bowed low to the king, his nostrils to the ground,"
Ii Samuel 24:21,"and Aravna said:
For-what-reason does my lord come to his servant?
David said:
To acquire the threshing-floor from you, to build an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>,
so that the plague may be restrained from upon the people!"
Ii Samuel 24:22,"Aravna said to David:
May my lord king take and offer up whatever is good in his eyes!
See, an ox is for the offering-up
and the sledges and the gear of the oxen are for wood;"
Ii Samuel 24:23,"all [this] does Aravna give, O king, to the king!
And Aravna said to the king:
May Y<small>HWH</small> your God show-you-good-will!"
Ii Samuel 24:24,"The king said to Aravna:
No,
rather I will acquire, acquire it from you at fair-price;
I will not offer up to Y<small>HWH</small> my God offerings-up [obtained] for nothing!
So David acquired the threshing-floor and the ox for silver, fifty weights,"
Ii Samuel 24:25,"and David built there an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>;
he offered up offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings.
And Y<small>HWH</small> let-himself-be-entreated for the land,
so that the plague was restrained from upon Israel."
