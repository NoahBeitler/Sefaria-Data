Ii Samuel 1:1,"It was after the death of Sha’ul
—David had returned from striking the Amalek[ites]—
that David stayed in Tziklag for two days."
Ii Samuel 1:2,"And it was on the third day,
that here, a man was coming from the camp, from Sha’ul,
with his garments torn and earth on his head;
and it was, when he came to David, that he flung himself on the ground and bowed low."
Ii Samuel 1:3,"David said to him:
Where are you coming from?
He said to him:
From the camp of Israel have I escaped!"
Ii Samuel 1:4,"David said to him:
How did the matter go? Now tell me!
He said:
[It was] that the fighting-people fled from the battle,
and also many fell of the fighting-people, and they died;
and also Sha’ul and Yehonatan his son died."
Ii Samuel 1:5,"David said to the lad, the one telling him:
How do you know that Sha’ul and Yehonatan his son are dead?"
Ii Samuel 1:6,"The lad, the one telling him, said:
I chanced, yes, chanced upon Mount Gilboa,
and here, Sha’ul was leaning on his spear,
and here, the charioteers and the horsemen were pressing-him-hard."
Ii Samuel 1:7,"He faced about behind him and saw me;
he called out to me,
and I said: Here I am."
Ii Samuel 1:8,"He said to me:
Who are you?
I said to him:
I am an Amalekite."
Ii Samuel 1:9,"He said to me:
Now stand over me and dispatch me,
for dizziness has come upon me,
though there is still life in me!"
Ii Samuel 1:10,"So I stood over him and dispatched him,
since I knew that he could not live after his having fallen;
then I took the diadem that was on his head
and the bracelet that was on his arm,
and have brought them to my lord here."
Ii Samuel 1:11,"David took hold of his clothes and tore them,
and likewise all the men that were with him;"
Ii Samuel 1:12,"they beat [the breast] and wept and fasted until sunset
over Sha’ul and over Yehonatan his son,
over the fighting-people of Y<small>HWH</small> and over the House of Israel,
since they had fallen by the sword."
Ii Samuel 1:13,"Then David said to the lad, the one telling him:
Where are you from?
He said:
I am the son of a sojourner man, an Amalekite."
Ii Samuel 1:14,"David said to him:
How were you not afraid
to stretch out your hand to bring Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one to ruin?"
Ii Samuel 1:15,"And David called to one of the serving-lads
and said:
Approach, attack him!
And he struck him down, so that he died."
Ii Samuel 1:16,"David said to him:
Your blood be on your head!
For your mouth bore witness against you, saying:
I myself dispatched Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one!"
Ii Samuel 1:17,"Now David sang-dirge with this dirge
over Sha’ul and over Yehonatan his son,"
Ii Samuel 1:18,"he said:
To teach the Children of Judah the bow,
here, it is written in the Record of the Upright:"
Ii Samuel 1:19,"O beauty of Israel, on your heights are the slain:
how have the mighty fallen!"
Ii Samuel 1:20,"Tell it not in Gat,
spread not the news in Ashkelon’s streets,
lest they rejoice, the daughters of the Philistines,
lest they exult, the daughters of the Foreskinned Ones!"
Ii Samuel 1:21,"O hills of Gilboa, let there be no dew, no rain upon you,
or surging of the [watery] deeps,
for there lies-soiled the shield of the mighty, the shield of Sha’ul,
no more anointed with oil."
Ii Samuel 1:22,"From the blood of the slain, from the sword of the mighty,
Yehonatan’s bow never turned back, Sha’ul’s sword never returned empty."
Ii Samuel 1:23,"Sha’ul and Yehonatan, those beloved and delightful ones—
in their lives and in their deaths they were not parted;
they were swifter than eagles, they were mightier than lions!"
Ii Samuel 1:24,"O daughters of Israel, weep over Sha’ul,
who clothed you in scarlet together with luxuries,
who with golden ornaments decked your apparel!"
Ii Samuel 1:25,"How have the mighty fallen, in the midst of battle,
Yehonatan slain on your heights—"
Ii Samuel 1:26,"I am distraught over you, my brother Yehonatan,
you were very delightful to me;
more wonderful was your love to me
than the love of women!"
Ii Samuel 1:27,"How have the mighty fallen,
yes, perished the weapons of battle!

Unresolved Political Tensions: The Death of Sha’ul and several of his sons in battle does not assure David of an easy transition to the throne. While his fellow Judahites anoint him as king, the bulk of the country, to both the north and the northeast, throws in its lot with Sha’ul’s son Ish-Boshet, who is backed by the powerful military commander Avner. A fierce battle ensues between soldiers loyal"
Ii Samuel 3:1,"It was [some time] after this
that David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Shall I go up into one of the towns of Judah?
Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Go up!
David said:
To where shall I go up?
He said:
To Hevron."
Ii Samuel 3:2,"So David went up there,
and also his two wives,
Ahinoam the Yizre’elite, and Avigayil the wife of Naval the Carmelite."
Ii Samuel 3:3,"As for his men who were with him, David brought them up, each one and his household,
and they settled in the towns of Hevron."
Ii Samuel 3:4,"And the men of Judah came and anointed David there as king over the House of Judah ….
They told David, saying:
The men of Yavesh-Gil’ad have buried Sha’ul."
Ii Samuel 3:5,"So David sent messengers to the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad;
he said to them:
Blessed are you of Y<small>HWH</small>,
in that you did this act-of-loyalty to your lord, to Sha’ul,
by burying him!"
Ii Samuel 3:6,"So-now,
may God show you loyalty and faithfulness,
and I too will do this act-of-good to you,
in exchange for your having done this thing!"
Ii Samuel 3:7,"And now,
let your hands be strengthened
and be valiant ones,
for your lord Sha’ul is dead,
and already it is I [whom] the House of Judah has anointed as king over them.
to David, led by Yoav, and the partisans of Sha’ul, led by Avner. In the process, the conflict gets personal, as Yoav’s brother is unavoidably slain by Avner, who then manages to obtain a cease-fire in the interests of preventing further bloodshed and civil war. But in a world often marked by blood vengeance, it is most unlikely that matters will stand the way they are.
The narrative is marked by an unusual echoing word: “after.” It resounds with both spatial and abstract meanings, fourteen times in twelve verses (19–30), and expresses well the concept of pursuit that is so central to the story. In the end, Avner’s “Do you not know that it will be bitter <i>afterward</i>?” (v.26; italics mine) summarizes the need to resolve the civil war."
Ii Samuel 3:8,"But Avner son of Ner, commander of the armed-forces that belonged to Sha’ul,
had taken Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul, and had had him cross over to Mahanayim;"
Ii Samuel 3:9,"he had made him king over Gil’ad, over the Geshurites, and over Yizre’el,
over Efrayim and over Binyamin—over Israel, all of it."
Ii Samuel 3:10,"Forty years old was Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul when he began to reign as king over Israel,
and for two years he reigned as king.
But the House of Judah was [following] after David."
Ii Samuel 3:11,"And the number of days that David was king in Hevron, over the House of Judah,
was seven years and six months."
Ii Samuel 3:12,"Now Avner son of Ner went out, along with the servants of Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul, from Mahanayim to Giv’on,"
Ii Samuel 3:13,"while Yoav son of Tzeruya and David’s servants went out [as well].
They met them by the Pool of Giv’on together,
and they sat down, these by the pool on this-side,
and those by the pool on that-side."
Ii Samuel 3:14,"Avner said to Yoav:
Let the fighting-lads arise and hold-a-contest before us!
Yoav said:
Let them arise!"
Ii Samuel 3:15,"So they arose and crossed over by number:
twelve for Binyamin and for Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul,
and twelve of David’s servants."
Ii Samuel 3:16,"And each one took hold of his neighbor’s head,
with his sword [thrust] into his neighbor’s side,
and they fell together.
So that place was called: Helkat Ha-Tzurim/Field of the Sword-Edges, which is in Giv’on."
Ii Samuel 3:17,"Now the battle was rough—exceedingly so—on that day,
and Avner and the men of Israel were defeated before David’s servants."
Ii Samuel 3:18,"Now three of the sons of Tzeruya were there: Yoav, Avishai, and Asa’el;
and Asa’el was swift of feet, like one of the gazelles that is in the open-field."
Ii Samuel 3:19,"Asa’el pursued after Avner;
he did not swerve to go to the right or to the left from after Avner."
Ii Samuel 3:20,"But Avner faced about after him
and said:
Is this you, Asa’el?
He said:
[It is] I."
Ii Samuel 3:21,"Avner said to him:
Swerve you to your right or to your left,
and seize for yourself one of our fighting-lads [instead], and take yourself his armor!
But Asa’el would not turn aside from [going] after him."
Ii Samuel 3:22,"Once again Avner said to Asa’el:
Turn you aside from [going] after me;
why should I strike you to the ground—
for how could I lift my face to Yoav your brother?"
Ii Samuel 3:23,"But he refused to turn aside,
so Avner struck him with the afterpart of the spear, in the abdomen,
so that the spear came out after him;
he fell there and died on the spot.
And it was: all who came to the place where Asa’el had fallen and died, stopped,"
Ii Samuel 3:24,"but Yoav and Avishai pursued after Avner.
Now when the sun had come in,
they came to the Hill of Amma, that faces Gi’ah,
on the way to the Wilderness of Giv’on."
Ii Samuel 3:25,"And the Children of Binyamin gathered themselves [to follow] after Avner;
they became a single group
and stopped at the top of a hill."
Ii Samuel 3:26,"And Avner called out to Yoav;
he said:
Is it forever that the sword must devour?
Do you not know
that it will be bitter afterward?
Until when will you not bid the fighting-people to turn back from [going] after their brothers?"
Ii Samuel 3:27,"Yoav said:
By the life of God,
indeed, had you only spoken,
indeed, already in the morning the people would have gone up, each one from [going] after his brother!"
Ii Samuel 3:28,"Then Yoav gave-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>, and all the people stopped;
they no longer pursued after Israel,
and no longer continued to do battle."
Ii Samuel 3:29,"Now Avner and his men went through the Plain all that night;
they crossed the Jordan
and went through the whole canyon, and came to Mahanayim."
Ii Samuel 3:30,"Now when Yoav returned from [going] after Avner,
he gathered all the people,
and there were counted-missing of David’s servants nineteen men along with Asa’el,"
Ii Samuel 3:31,"while David’s servants struck down some of Binyamin, among Avner’s servants—
three hundred and sixty men died.

Civil War; the Death of Avner: The report on the ongoing civil war is interrupted by the birth notice of David’s sons, six by six different wives. Indeed, sexual politics begins the chapter, with Avner sleeping with Sha’ul’s concubine Ritzpa, to the chagrin of Sha’ul’s son Ish-Boshet. This classic demonstration of political power enables Avner to negotiate with David, which obviously needs to be done, but the king will agree to a treaty only if his own former wife Mikhal, Sha’ul’s daughter, is returned to him. So, sandwiched in between the violence of the last chapter and the violence that is to come, the first half of this chapter is punctuated by strong words and strong emotions, from Ish-Boshet’s complaints, Avner’s retort and negotiating statements, to the weeping of Paltiel, Mikhal’s second husband, who helplessly walks behind her as she is returned to David. The result of the negotiations is a carefully wrought agreement that the northern region, Israel, will acknowledge David as king, and that Ish-Boshet’s life will not be threatened.
The “peace” described in v.21 cannot last, however, because Yoav, as we will continuously encounter him in these stories, is a “rough” man (v.39) who does not forgive and who constantly looks out for and unhesitatingly acts on David’s interests. He cannot permit the man who killed his brother to live, even though we saw in the previous chapter that Avner tried his best to avoid killing Asa’el. And it does not seem coincidental that Avner’s death would obviously have the effect of quashing David’s northern opposition.
At this point, from v.28 on, the text goes to great lengths to clear David of Avner’s brutal murder. Not only does he put a curse on the house of Yoav, but he gets the entire people to mourn over Avner, composing a brief dirge for the occasion (vv.33–34)."
Ii Samuel 3:45,"And they carried Asa’el away and buried him in the burial-place of his father, which is in Bet-Lehem.
Then they went all night, Yoav and his men,
with light breaking upon them in Hevron."
Ii Samuel 4:1,"And the war was long-lasting between the House of Sha’ul and the House of David;
David went on becoming stronger, while the House of Sha’ul went on becoming weaker."
Ii Samuel 4:2,"Now sons were born to David in Hevron:
his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Yezre’elite,"
Ii Samuel 4:3,"and his second was Kil’av, by Avigayil wife of Naval, the Carmelite,
and the third was Avshalom son of Maakha, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur,"
Ii Samuel 4:4,"and the fourth was Adoniyya son of Haggit,
and the fifth was Shefatya son of Avital,"
Ii Samuel 4:5,"and the sixth was Yitre’am, by Egla wife of David.
These were born to David in Hevron."
Ii Samuel 4:6,"And it was,
when there was war between the House of Sha’ul and the House of David,
that Avner was gaining strength in the House of Sha’ul."
Ii Samuel 4:7,"Now Sha’ul had a concubine, her name was Ritzpa daughter of Aya.
And [Ish-Boshet] said to Avner:
For-what-reason did you come in to my father’s concubine?"
Ii Samuel 4:8,"Avner became exceedingly agitated over the words of Ish-Boshet;
he said:
Am I the head of a dog belonging to Judah?
Today I do an act-of-loyalty to the House of Sha’ul your father,
for his brothers and for his friends,
and have not let you come into David’s hand—
yet you account me with a fault concerning a woman today!"
Ii Samuel 4:9,"Thus may God do to Avner, and thus may he add to him;
indeed, [just] as Y<small>HWH</small> swore to David,
indeed, thus I will do to him—"
Ii Samuel 4:10,"to have the kingship cross over from the House of Sha’ul,
to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah,
from Dan to Be’er-Sheva!"
Ii Samuel 4:11,"He was not able to answer Avner another word, out of his fear of him."
Ii Samuel 4:12,"And Avner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying:
Whose is [the] land?
Cut your covenant with me,
Here, my hand is with you, to bring all Israel around to you!"
Ii Samuel 4:13,"He said:
Good,
I myself will cut a covenant with you;
but one thing I will require of you, namely:
you are not to see my face
unless you first bring Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul, when you come to see my face."
Ii Samuel 4:14,"So David sent messengers to Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul, saying:
Give over my wife, Mikhal,
whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred Philistine foreskins!"
Ii Samuel 4:15,"Ish-Boshet sent and took her from [her] husband, from Paltiel son of Layish."
Ii Samuel 4:16,"And her husband went with her, going along and weeping behind her, as far as Bahurim.
Then Avner said to him:
Go, turn back! And he turned back."
Ii Samuel 4:17,"Now the word of Avner was with the elders of Israel, saying:
Even yesterday, even [the] day-before, you have been seeking [to set] David as king over you."
Ii Samuel 4:18,"So-now, do it!
For Y<small>HWH</small> has said of David, saying:
By the hand of David my servant
I will deliver my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies!"
Ii Samuel 4:19,"Avner spoke likewise in the hearing of Binyamin,
and Avner went likewise to speak in the hearing of David in Hevron
all that was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the House of Binyamin."
Ii Samuel 4:20,"And Avner came to David in Hevron,
—with him were twenty men—
and David made a drinkfest for Avner and for the men who were with him."
Ii Samuel 4:21,"Then Avner said to David:
Let me arise, let me go,
and let me gather all Israel to my lord king,
that they may cut a covenant with you
and that you may become king according to all that your appetite craves.
So David sent Avner away,
and he went off in peace."
Ii Samuel 4:22,"Now here, David’s servants and Yoav came back from raiding, and abundant spoils they brought with them—
but Avner was not with David in Hevron,
for he had sent him off, and he had gone away in peace."
Ii Samuel 4:23,"When Yoav and all the forces that were with him came, [someone] told Yoav, saying:
Avner the son of Ner came to the king,
but he sent him off and he went away in peace!"
Ii Samuel 4:24,"So Yoav came to the king and said:
What have you done?
Here, Avner came to you—
why now did you send him off,
so that he has gone, yes, gone?

The Death of Ish-Boshet: In the course of the ongoing civil war, another assassination is committed. This time the victim is Sha’ul’s son Ish-Boshet (or, in uncensored form, Ish-Baal). The chapter begins with several brief notes: Sha’ul’s son is terrified to hear about Avner’s recent death; we are introduced to two of his chieftains; and we are informed that a grandson scion of Sha’ul is alive, albeit a lame young man. The story proper starts in v.5, where Ish-Boshet is killed, Mafia-style, in his bed. Initially, no motive is given, especially as the assassins are from Ish-Boshet’s own circle, but it soon becomes clear that the two men are seeking compensation from David. He, however, reacts the same way he had to the Amalekite messenger in Chap. 1, even referring back to that incident himself, and the culprits are executed. In addition, they are mutilated, with their bodies put on public display. Much as in the classic period of sixteenth-century England, “treason” gets its very public reward. And once again, David is portrayed as indignant at the commission of violent deeds from which, however, he ultimately profits."
Ii Samuel 5:9,"You know Avner the son of Ner:
indeed, to dupe you he came,
to gain knowledge of your going out and your coming in,
and to gain knowledge of all that you are doing!"
Ii Samuel 5:10,"So Yoav went out from David,
and he sent messengers after Avner;
they returned him from the cistern of Sira,
but David did not know [about it]."
Ii Samuel 5:11,"Avner returned to Hevron,
and Yoav took him to the inner-part of the gate, to speak with him quietly,
but he struck him in the abdomen, so that he died,
[in exchange] for the blood of Asa’el his brother."
Ii Samuel 5:12,"David heard [of it], after this,
and said:
Clear-of-blame am I and my kingdom by Y<small>HWH</small>, for the ages,
from the blood of Avner son of Ner—"
Ii Samuel 5:13,"may it alight on the head of Yoav and on all his Father’s House;
may there never be cut off from the House of Yoav
[anyone] with a flow, or with <i>tzaraat</i>,
or [a male] taking hold of a spindle, or one falling by the sword, or one lacking food!"
Ii Samuel 5:14,"Now Yoav and Avishai his brother had killed Avner
on account that he had caused the death of Asa’el their brother at Giv’on, in battle."
Ii Samuel 5:15,"And David said to Yoav and to all the people that were with him:
Tear your garments and gird yourselves with sackcloth,
and beat [the breast] before Avner!
Now King David [himself] walked after the bier."
Ii Samuel 5:16,"They buried Avner in Hevron,
and the king lifted up his voice and wept upon the burial-place of Avner,
and all the people wept."
Ii Samuel 5:17,"And the king intoned-a-dirge over Avner; he said:
Like the death of a vile one, should Avner have died?"
Ii Samuel 5:18,"Your hands were not bound,
your feet were not put in double-bronze;
like one falling before the corrupt you fell!
And all the people continued to weep over him."
Ii Samuel 5:19,"Then all the people came to nourish David with bread while it was daylight,
but David swore, saying:
Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add,
if before the coming in of the sun I taste bread or anything [else]!"
Ii Samuel 5:20,"All the people took note, and it was good in their eyes;
like all that the king did, in the eyes of the people it was good."
Ii Samuel 5:21,"So all the people and all Israel knew on that day
that it had not been from the king to cause the death of Avner son of Ner."
Ii Samuel 5:22,"The king said to his servants:
Do you not know
that a commander and a great [man] has fallen in Israel this day?"
Ii Samuel 5:23,"As for me, today I am softhearted, though anointed as king,
while these men, the sons of Tzeruya, are too rough for me!
May Y<small>HWH</small> pay back the doer of evil in accordance with his evil-deed!"
Ii Samuel 6:1,"The son of Sha’ul heard that Avner was dead in Hevron,
and his hands grew slack,
while all Israel were terrified."
Ii Samuel 6:2,"Now two men, commanders of raiding-bands, belonged to the son of Sha’ul;
the name of the one was Baana, and the name of the second was Rekhav,
sons of Rimmon the Be’erotite, of the Children of Binyamin.
—For Be’erot too was reckoned to Binyamin:"
Ii Samuel 6:3,"the Be’erotites had got away to Gittayim,
and they have continued sojourning there, until this day.—"
Ii Samuel 6:4,"Now Yehonatan son of Sha’ul had a son, stricken in the feet;
he had been five years old when the tidings had come of Sha’ul and Yehonatan, from Yizre’el,
and his caretaker had lifted him up and fled.
It was in her haste to flee that he had fallen and been made lame.
—His name was Mefiboshet."
Ii Samuel 6:5,"So the sons of Rimmon the Be’erotite, Rekhav and Baana, went
and came, at the heat of the day, to the house of Ish-Boshet,
while he was lying down for the noonday nap."
Ii Samuel 6:6,"And here, when they came into the midst of the house, as fetchers of wheat,
they struck him in the abdomen;
then Rekhav and Baana his brother escaped."
Ii Samuel 6:7,"—They had come into the house
while he was lying on his couch, in his bedroom,
and had struck him down and caused his death,
and had removed his head.—
They took his head
and went off, by way of the Plain, all night,"
Ii Samuel 6:8,"and they brought the head of Ish-Boshet to David at Hevron,
and said to the king:
Here is the head of Ish-Boshet son of Sha’ul your enemy, who sought your life—
Y<small>HWH</small> has granted vengeance to my lord king this day on Sha’ul and on his seed!

Ii Samuel 7:4,"<b>Now Yehonatan … had a son:</b> This verse is parenthetical. Despite the events of this chapter, the text apparently wishes to establish that someone from Sha’ul’s line has survived (McCarter 198). <b>stricken:</b> Crippled. <b>feet:</b> Or “legs”; biblical Hebrew does not make the distinction. <b>tidings:</b> Of their death. <b>Mefiboshet:</b> Pronounced <i>meh-fee-BO-shet;</i> trad. English “Mephibosheth.” The name means “from the Mouth of Baal/Boshet.” The original form of the name, mentioned in I Chron. 8:3 and 9:0, is “Merib-baal.”"
Ii Samuel 7:5,"<b>nap:</b> Heb. <i>mishkav</i>, from the same root (<i>sh-k-b</i>), “to lie down,” that echoes in this chapter, emphasizing the heinousness of the murder.

Ii Samuel 7:6,"<b>as fetchers of wheat:</b> Pretending to be farmhands, and thus with access to the house. In these verses, LXX has a longer text, in which a woman guarding the house falls asleep, enabling the assassins to enter.
Major Victories for David: A number of episodes are strung together here, all demonstrating David’s ascendancy as king and as military leader. First (vv.1–5) he receives the throne of all Israel, at the request of the northern tribes. Following on the heels of Ish-Boshet’s assassination, this seems both surprising and logical.
In vv.6–9, David conquers Jerusalem, which had thus far resisted takeover by the Israelites (despite Judg. 1:8). The text is incredibly brief, despite the great importance of the deed. We are not initially told why David decides to attack the Jebusite enclave, but the subsequent chapters make clear that he desires to make it the new capital of a united Israel, a politically ingenious move, since the city was quite defensible and situated close to the border between the northern and southern sections of the country.
The text continues at v.10, with several passages befitting a king: vv.10–11 trace the beginnings of an important alliance, with King Hiram of Tyre in Phoenicia, resulting in the building of a palace for David—a step beyond Sha’ul’s chieftain-style rule. This seems to produce proof of divine favor (v.12), a theme which will be at the forefront of Chap. 7. Then (vv.13–16) we are given a list of children born to David in Jerusalem. In summary, we now have a king over all Israel, with a major alliance, a palace, and numerous heirs—a good recipe for political stability.
The chapter concludes with a larger story (vv.17–25) in which it is clear that having become king has not softened David the warrior. He is able to decisively defeat the Philistines, with the assistance of God. The victory cements his military accomplishments, as it was the long-lasting superiority of the Philistines that had led to the people’s request for a king in I Sam. 8 in the first place."
Ii Samuel 7:7,"David answered Rekhav and Baana his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Be’erotite;
he said to them:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
who has saved my life from every trouble:"
Ii Samuel 7:8,"indeed, the one telling me, saying: Here, Sha’ul is dead!,
though he was like a bearer-of-[good]-news in his [own] eyes,
I seized him and killed him in Tziklag,
one to whom I might have given [reward for the] news!"
Ii Samuel 7:9,"More so, when guilty men have killed an innocent man in his house, in his bedroom!
So-now,
should I not seek-satisfaction for his blood at your hand,
and eradicate you from the land?"
Ii Samuel 7:10,"So David commanded the fighting-lads,
and they killed them and chopped off their hands and their feet
and hung them up by the pool in Hevron,
while the head of Ish-Boshet they took
and buried in the burial-place of Avner in Hevron."
Ii Samuel 8:1,"All the staff-bearers of Israel came to David in Hevron;
they said, saying:
Here we are—your bone and your flesh are we!"
Ii Samuel 8:2,"Even yesterday, even the day-before, when Sha’ul was king over us,
it was you who took out and brought back Israel [in battle],
and Y<small>HWH</small> said to you:
<i>You</i> shall shepherd my people Israel,
<i>you</i> shall be <i>Nagid</i> over Israel!"
Ii Samuel 8:3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hevron,
and King David cut a covenant with them at Hevron, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and they anointed David as king over Israel."
Ii Samuel 8:4,"Thirty years old was David when he became king;
for forty years he reigned as king:"
Ii Samuel 8:5,"in Hevron he reigned as king over Judah for seven years and six months,
and in Jerusalem he reigned as king for thirty-three years, over all Israel and Judah."
Ii Samuel 8:6,"Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Yevusites, the settled-folk of the region,
but they said to David, saying:
You are not to enter here!
—For the blind and the lame had incited them, saying:
David is not to enter here!—"
Ii Samuel 8:7,But David captured the Fortress of Zion—that is the city of David.
Ii Samuel 8:8,"And David said on that day:
Whoever strikes down a Yevusite
and reaches the water-shaft … ,
since the lame and the blind are hated by David’s very self;
therefore they say:
The blind and the lame are not to enter the Temple-House!"
Ii Samuel 8:9,"David settled in the fortress,
and he called it the City of David;
and David built all around, from the Earthfill and inward."
Ii Samuel 8:10,"And David went on and on becoming great;
Y<small>HWH</small>, God of the Forces-On-High, was with him."
Ii Samuel 8:11,"Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David,
along with cedar wood and wood carvers and stone wall carvers;
they built a palace-house for David."
Ii Samuel 8:12,"And David knew that Y<small>HWH</small> had established him as king over Israel,
and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel."
Ii Samuel 8:13,"David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, after his coming back from Hevron,
and more [children] were born to David, sons and daughters."
Ii Samuel 8:14,"And these are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem:
Shammua and Shovav,
Natan and Shelomo,"
Ii Samuel 8:15,"Yivhar and Elishua, Nefeg and Yafi’a,"
Ii Samuel 8:16,"Elishama, Elyada and Elifelet."
Ii Samuel 8:17,"The Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel,
so all the Philistines went up to seek out David.
David heard, and he went down to the fortress."
Ii Samuel 8:18,"Now the Philistines had come
and had spread out in the Valley of the Shades."
Ii Samuel 8:19,"So David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Shall I go up against the Philistines?
Will you give them into my hand?
Y<small>HWH</small> said to David:
Go up,
for I will give, yes, give the Philistines into your hand!"
Ii Samuel 8:20,"David came to Baal-Peratzim/Master of Bursting Forth,
and David struck them there;
he said:
Y<small>HWH</small> has burst my enemies before me like a bursting forth of water!
Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-Peratzim/Master of Bursting Forth."
Ii Samuel 8:21,"They abandoned their idols there,
and David and his men carried them off.

Jerusalem Taken; the Coffer’s Journey: The account of how Jerusalem is consecrated, and its preeminent political status assured, by the bringing of the Coffer (others, “Ark”) to reside there, has some unexpected twists. From David’s point of view, this momentous religious and political act should be filled with joy, and the text (vv.5 and 13–14) indeed stresses the unfettered jubilation of the occasion through music and David’s leaping and dancing. But the positive emotions of the moment are marred by two incidents, one public and one private. As the Coffer initially travels by wagon, it begins to slip, and the Israelite who tries to steady it is struck dead by God. This “carelessness” of physical contact, which might baffle modern readers since its intention is pure, nevertheless violates the sanctity of the object, and we are reminded that the Coffer represents God and is thus separated from normal human contact. It is a boundary that, in ancient cultures, must not be breached. At the same time, Uzza’s death leads David to despair of ever attaining his royal goals.
The second incident in the chapter is colorful and very telling. Mikhal, the nouveau princess, is unable to stomach the mundane and, to her, undignified sight of her husband jumping and dancing for joy at the Coffer’s entry to the city. She seems not to understand his strong emotions—or, possibly, his near nakedness reminds her of her father’s prophetic moments, which had caused people to whisper (see I Sam. 19:24). At any rate, David counters her accusation that he is acting lewdly with a sexual threat of his own (v.22, “with the serving-maids of whom you spoke … I’ll get honor!”). After several chapters that have contained two long lists of David’s progeny, this one ends with the sober notice that Mikhal remained childless to the end of her days. So for multiple reasons, there will ultimately be no merging of the houses of Sha’ul and David. Biologically as well as militarily and politically, David’s victory is now complete. We can now proceed to God’s long and firm promises to the new king."
Ii Samuel 9:14,"But the Philistines went up again,
and spread out in the Valley of the Shades."
Ii Samuel 9:15,"So David inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and he said:
You are not to go up;
lead [your men] around, behind them,
and come at them in front of the balsam-trees."
Ii Samuel 9:16,"And let it be:
when you hear the sound of marching on the tops of the balsam-trees, then you are to act-decisively,
for then Y<small>HWH</small> will go out before you, to strike down the camp of the Philistines."
Ii Samuel 9:17,"David did thus, as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him;
he struck the Philistines from Geva until where-you-come to Gezer."
Ii Samuel 10:1,"David continued [gathering] every hand-picked [man] in Israel, thirty thousand."
Ii Samuel 10:2,"And David arose and went, along with all the fighting-people who were with him, from Baala in Judah,
to bring up from there the Coffer of God, over which was called the name of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, [The One] Seated on the Winged-Sphinxes."
Ii Samuel 10:3,"They mounted the Coffer of God on a new wagon
and transported it from the house of Avinadav, which is in Giv’a,
while Uzza and Ahyo, the sons of Avinadav, were driving the new wagon."
Ii Samuel 10:4,"They transported it from the house of Avinadav that is in Giv’a, with the Coffer of God,
with Ahyo walking in front of the Coffer."
Ii Samuel 10:5,"Now David and the whole house of Israel were dancing in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
with all the fir wood [instruments],
with lyres and with lutes and with timbrels,
with rattles and with cymbals."
Ii Samuel 10:6,"They came to the threshing-floor of Nakhon,
and Uzza stretched out [his hand] to the Coffer of God and took hold of it,
for the oxen had let it slip."
Ii Samuel 10:7,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up at Uzza,
and God struck him down there because of [his] carelessness, so that he died there,
beside the Coffer of God."
Ii Samuel 10:8,"And David was agitated over [the fact] that Y<small>HWH</small> had burst forth, a bursting forth against Uzza,
so that place is called Peretz Uzza/Bursting Forth [at] Uzza,
until this day."
Ii Samuel 10:9,"And David was fearful of God on that day;
he said:
How will the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> [ever] come to me?"
Ii Samuel 10:10,"And David would not remove the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> from him to the City of David,
so David turned it aside to the house of Oved-Edom the Gittite."
Ii Samuel 10:11,"The Coffer stayed at the house of Oved-Edom the Gittite for three months,
and Y<small>HWH</small> blessed Oved-Edom and all his household."
Ii Samuel 10:12,"It was told to King David, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> has blessed the house of Oved-Edom and all that is his, on account of the Coffer of God;
so David went and brought up the Coffer of God from the house of Oved-Edom to the City of David, with rejoicing."
Ii Samuel 10:13,"It was,
when those transporting the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> had stepped forward six steps,
that he sacrificed an ox and a fatling."
Ii Samuel 10:14,"And David was whirling with all [his] might in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>;
David was girded with an <i>efod</i> of linen."
Ii Samuel 10:15,Now David and all the House of Israel were bringing up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> with shouting and with the sound of the <i>shofar;</i>
Ii Samuel 10:16,"and as the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> was coming into the City of David,
Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul was looking out through the window:
she saw King David leaping and whirling in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and she despised him in her heart."
Ii Samuel 10:17,"They brought the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>
and set it in its place, in the middle of the tent that David had spread out for it.
And David offered up offerings-up in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, and <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
Ii Samuel 10:18,"[When] David had finished offering up the offering-up and the <i>shalom</i>-offerings,
he blessed the people in the name of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High,"
Ii Samuel 10:19,"and divided up [food] for the whole people, for the whole throng of Israel, from man to woman
—for each: one cake of bread, one roll, and one raisin-cake—
and all the people went off, each one to his house."
Ii Samuel 10:20,"Then David returned to bless his household;
but Mikhal daughter of Sha’ul went out to meet David
and said:
How he has gotten honor today, the king of Israel,
who has exposed himself today before the eyes of his servants’ maids—
like one of [those] empty-men exposes himself!

The Davidic Covenant: Now that David’s throne is secure (God has “given-him-rest,” v.1), he logically seeks to build the one thing that his kingdom lacks: a temple. In the ancient Near East, such a desire would have been prompted not merely by piety; temples were political statements as well, symbolizing a god’s approval and protection of the regime. The king’s plea prompts a new character, Natan the court prophet, to encourage him, only to be overruled by YHWH: his son Shelomo (Solomon), not David, will get to build it. In the process, the text switches to a Deuteronomistic style, and we encounter what many would characterize as a masterpiece of royal propaganda. It is distinguished by, among other traits, wordiness, both in YHWH’s promises and in David’s grateful response.
The basic message of the chapter is that Y<small>HWH</small> will be with David, and that he will establish both “my people” and the Davidic throne in perpetuity. The speeches are punctuated by several key words, first of all “name,” here referring most often to God, whose fame will be augmented by what he does with Israel and by the future temple. “House,” in the multiple senses of Temple and dynasty, appears fifteen times, and the encouraging “for the ages” eight times. Not surprisingly, the verb meaning “to make firm” appears five times, to stress God’s commitment. And David’s response to divine generosity contains the formal marker of submission: ten times in vv.19–29 he uses the expression “your servant” in speaking to God."
Ii Samuel 11:14,"David said to Mikhal:
In the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, who chose me over your father and over all his house, to commission me as <i>Nagid</i> over the people of Y<small>HWH</small>, over Israel:

indeed, there is none like you
and no God beside you

Ii Samuel 12:23,"And who is like your people, like Israel,
a singular nation on earth,
whom God went forth to redeem for himself as a people,
to make for himself a name
and to do for you great things, and awe-inspiring [acts] for your land,

[driving out] nations and their gods?"
Ii Samuel 12:24,"You have made your people Israel firm, as a people for yourself for the ages,
and you, O Y<small>HWH</small>, you have become God for them.

Warrior King; Bureaucracy: Resuming the activities reported at the end of Chap. 5, David makes short order of Philistines, Moabites, and Arameans, with the result that he acquires a large amount of gold, silver, and bronze. These are “hallowed to YHWH” (v.11), in line with the portrayal of the king as faithful servant in the mode of Deuteronomy. And the text emphasizes how David’s victories are attributable to YHWH’s presence “wherever he went” (vv.6 and 14). This theological thrust, however, is accompanied by a more secular note about political strategy: Israelite garrisons are established throughout conquered Aramean territory.
The chapter ends with the initial part of a textual bracket (as noted by Brettler 1995), a list of David’s officials, which will recur at the end of Chap. 20. Their functions include such royal, military, and religious duties as would have been found in many ancient Near Eastern states—proof either of David’s historical power or of a later generation’s desire to see him in their own terms."

Mefiboshet: David’s consolidation of power now makes it feasible for him to be magnanimous. As was noted previously in II 4, a descendant of Sha’ul has survived the civil war. As a man who is lame, Mefiboshet poses no threat to David, since such a condition would naturally have made it impossible for him to lead troops against the king, and so David allows him to both maintain a large laboring household and have a regular seat at the royal table. This arrangement recurs at the end of Kings, and hence at the end of the entire four-book sequence of the Early Prophets, where the surviving Davidic king, Yehoiakhin, is released from captivity in Babylon and boarded at state expense. His status as a favored but impotent royal figure is as telling there as Mefiboshet’s is here.
The House of Sha’ul seems to have survived for centuries, at least in memory; inclusion of passages sympathetic to Sha’ul indicate a later desire to be sensitive to ongoing northern traditions. This kind of attachment to past loyalties can still be seen in many countries and cultures, as witnessed in the ethnic and religious conflicts of recent times."
Ii Samuel 16:1,"David said:
Is there yet anyone that remains from the House of Sha’ul?
—so that I may show him loyalty for the sake of Yehonatan."

War with Ammonites and Arameans: At the start of Sha’ul’s reign, he had rescued a town from the Ammonite king Nahash (I Sam. 11). Seeking now to cement ties with the Ammonites, David is met with suspicion and bad behavior—the humiliation of his emissaries—by the son of this same Nahash. David’s subsequent attack overcomes mainly Arameans who had been hired as mercenaries by the Ammonites. The latter now realize their mistake. By the end of the chapter it is clear that the Ammonites’ days as an effective enemy of Israel are numbered. Before their defeat at the hands of the Israelites can occur, however, the text turns to a contemporary incident which will reverberate far beyond the context of a local war."
Ii Samuel 16:12,"The king called Tziva, Sha’ul’s serving-lad, and said to him:

Ii Samuel 17:3,"But the officials of the Children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord:
Is David [really] honoring your father in your eyes,
when he sends you comforters?
Isn’t it for the sake of spying out the town, to explore it and to overthrow it
that David has sent his servants to you?"
Ii Samuel 17:4,"So Hanun took David’s servants,
he shaved off half their beards
and cut their clothes in half, as far as their buttocks,
and then he sent them off."

so he chose from all the choice-warriors in Israel

Amnon and Tamar: If the previous story constituted the great divide in David’s life as king, the next one immediately launches into its consequences. David’s desire for a woman, culminating in a tale of adultery and murder, is followed by his son Amnon’s obsession with his own half sister, which leads him to rape and then spurn Tamar. He is subsequently cut down in an act of revenge by her full brother Avshalom. The fact that Amnon is the heir to the throne well illustrates the fateful mixing of private and public spheres that is characteristic of many narratives on biblical leadership.
In further emphasizing the connection between the two texts, several words recur here. The story picks up on the “nourishment” that David had refused in Chap. 12 and makes it into a major motif, resounding six times in six verses. “Lying/lying down” also returns, understandably. What is new, though, is the intensity of speech between the central characters. Not only do terrible things occur, but they are haggled over, and we are brought into the realm of extreme emotions: obsession, desperation, shame, rejection, and vengefulness.
Amid the personal details, this narrative also opens the Avshalom cycle, as noted in the Introduction to Samuel above, with the repetition of the theme word “heart.” In addition to its use as a descriptor of Tamar’s prepared food, it appears in Avshalom’s ironic statement to his sister in v.20, “Don’t take this thing to heart!”
The sequence of events leading to the murder of Amnon is telling. In a move that suggests elements of the opening of the Yosef story in Genesis, a father sends his son into a situation of certain conflict (note too Amnon’s “Have everyone go out from me” in v.9, recalling the moment before Yosef reveals himself to his brothers in Gen. 45:1, and the mention of Tamar’s “ornamented tunic,” a phrase used to describe Yosef’s famous article of clothing in Gen. 37:3). The fact that the king at first believes the rumor that all of his sons have been murdered (vv.30–31) is perhaps indicative of a suddenly fragile state of mind. The first part of God’s recent statement of punishment for David’s crimes, “So-now— / the sword shall not depart from your house for the ages” (12:10), has received its first fulfillment.
This part of the chapter structurally balances the earlier rape scene, encompassing refusal, the appearance of Yonadav, eating, and grief marked by the usual tearing of clothing (Polzin 1989). It also suggests what will be more fully developed subsequently, namely, Avshalom’s reprising of some of his father’s traits and experiences. Here, he flees for a time, as David had fled from Sha’ul."
Ii Samuel 19:1,"It was [some time] after this:
now Avshalom son of David had a beautiful sister—her name was Tamar,
and Amnon son of David fell in love with her."
Ii Samuel 19:2,"And Amnon was distressed to [the point of] being sick because of Tamar his sister
—indeed, she was a nubile-girl—
and it seemed impossible in Amnon’s eyes to do anything to her."
Ii Samuel 19:3,"Now Amnon had a friend—his name was Yonadav son of Shim’a, David’s brother,
and Yonadav was an exceedingly worldly-wise man."
Ii Samuel 19:4,"He said to him:
For-what-reason are you so haggard, O son of the king, morning after morning?
Won’t you tell me?
Amnon said to him:
Tamar—the sister—of Avshalom—my brother—I love!"
Ii Samuel 19:5,"Yehonadav said to him:
Lie down on your lying-place and feign-sickness,
and when your father comes to see you, say to him:
Now let Tamar my sister come
and nourish me with some food;
let her make the nourishment ready before my eyes, in order that I may see it,
and I will eat from her hand."
Ii Samuel 19:6,"So Amnon lay down and feigned-sickness,
and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king:
Now let Tamar my sister come
and heat two heartcakes before my eyes,
that I may be nourished from her hand."
Ii Samuel 19:7,"David sent [word] to Tamar, in the palace-house, saying:
Pray go to the house of Amnon your brother
and make him some nourishment."
Ii Samuel 19:8,"So Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother, while he was lying down.
She took some dough, kneaded it, heated it before his eyes, and boiled the heartcakes;"
Ii Samuel 19:9,"then she took the pot and placed it before him,
but he refused to eat.
Amnon said:
Have everyone go out from me!
And everyone went out from him."
Ii Samuel 19:10,"Amnon said to Tamar:
Bring the nourishment into the inner-room, so that I may be nourished from your hand!
So Tamar took the heartcakes that she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother into the inner-room."
Ii Samuel 19:11,"She brought them close to him to eat,
but he overpowered her and said to her:
Come, lie with me, sister!"
Ii Samuel 19:12,"She said to him:
No, brother, don’t force me,
for such is not to be done in Israel—
don’t do this vile thing!"
Ii Samuel 19:13,"As for me, where would I take my disgrace?
And as for you, you would be like one of the vile ones in Israel!
So-now, just speak to the king—indeed, he will not withhold me from you!"
Ii Samuel 19:14,"But he would not hearken to her voice;
he overpowered her and forced her, and lay with her."
Ii Samuel 19:15,"Then Amnon hated her with an exceedingly great hatred—
indeed, greater was the hatred with which he hated her than the love with which he had loved her.
Amnon said to her:
Get up! Go!"
Ii Samuel 19:16,"She said to him:
About this great evil—more than the other thing that you did to me—sending me away … !
But he would not hearken to her;"
Ii Samuel 19:17,"he called to his attending lad
and said:
Just send this one away from me, outside,
and lock the door behind her!"
Ii Samuel 19:18,"—Now on her was an ornamented tunic,
for thus were the king’s nubile daughters clothed in robes.—
So his attendant brought her outside, and locked the door behind her."
Ii Samuel 19:19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head,
while the ornamented tunic that was on her she tore;
she put her hands on her head
and went along, going along and crying out."
Ii Samuel 19:20,"Avshalom her brother said to her:
Has Amnon your brother been with you?
For now, sister, be silent—he is your brother;
do not take this thing to heart!
So Tamar stayed, desolate, in the house of Avshalom her brother."
Ii Samuel 19:21,"Now when King David heard about all these things,
he was exceedingly agitated."
Ii Samuel 19:22,"And Avshalom would not speak with Amnon, [anything] from evil to good,
for Avshalom hated Amnon over the fact that he had forced Tamar his sister."
Ii Samuel 19:23,"Now it was at two-years’ time
that they were shearing [sheep] for Avshalom in Baal Hatzor that is near Efrayim,
and Avshalom invited all the king’s sons."
Ii Samuel 19:24,"Avshalom came to the king
and said:
Now here, your servant is having shearing [done];
now let the king and his servants go with your servant."
Ii Samuel 19:25,"The king said to Avshalom:
No, my son, now we cannot go, all of us;
let us not weigh-heavily on you!
He pressed him, but he would not go,
and he gave him farewell-blessing."
Ii Samuel 19:26,"Avshalom said:
If not, now let Amnon my brother go with us.
The king said to him:
Why should he go with you?"
Ii Samuel 19:27,"But Avshalom pressed him,
so he sent Amnon with him, along with all the king’s sons."
Ii Samuel 19:28,"And Avshalom charged his serving-lads, saying:
Now take note: when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine,
and I say to you: Strike down Amnon!,
then put him to death—do not be afraid!
Have not I myself charged you?
Be strong, be valiant ones!"
Ii Samuel 19:29,"So Avshalom’s lads did to Amnon as Avshalom had charged,
and all the king’s sons arose and mounted each on his mule, and they fled."
Ii Samuel 19:30,"It was, when they were on the way,
that the rumor came to David, namely:
Avshalom has struck down all the king’s sons;
not one of them is left!"
Ii Samuel 19:31,"The king arose and tore his garments, and lay down on the ground,
while all his servants stood [over him] with torn garments."
Ii Samuel 19:32,"But Yonadav son of Shim’a, David’s brother, spoke up and said:
Let not my lord think that all the lads, the king’s sons,
have been put-to-death,
for Amnon alone has died;
for by Avshalom’s mouth it has been determined since the time of his forcing Tamar his sister."
Ii Samuel 19:33,"So-now,
do not let the king take the matter to heart, saying: All the king’s sons have died,
for Amnon alone has died,"
Ii Samuel 19:34,"and Avshalom has gotten away.
And the serving-lad standing watch lifted up his eyes and saw:
now here, many people were going away on the road behind him, from the side of the hill."
Ii Samuel 19:35,"Yonadav said to the king:
Here, the king’s sons have come;
exactly as your servant’s word, so it was!"
Ii Samuel 19:36,"And it was, when he finished speaking,
that here, the king’s sons came;
they lifted up their voices and wept,
and also the king and all his servants wept, an exceedingly great weeping."
Ii Samuel 19:37,"—Now Avshalom had gotten away;
he had gone to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur.—
And he mourned for his son all the days."
Ii Samuel 19:38,"Now Avshalom had gotten away and gone to Geshur,
and he was there for three years."
Ii Samuel 19:39,"Then the king’s spirit was spent for going out against Avshalom,
for he was consoled concerning Amnon, for he was dead.

Ii Samuel 20:1,"<b>Avshalom:</b> Pronounced <i>ahv-shah-LOM</i>. The name combines “Father” (figuratively God, or actually David) and “Peace/Well-being.” <b>Tamar:</b> Pronounced <i>tah-MAHR</i>. Her name means “date-palm.” <b>Amnon:</b> Pronounced <i>ahm-NOHN</i>. Tamar and Avshalom’s half brother and heir to the throne. His name ironically connotes “faithful.”"
Ii Samuel 20:2,"<b>nubile-girl:</b> As with Jephthah’s daughter in Judg. 1, the word <i>betula</i> here probably refers to a young woman of marriageable age rather than to a virgin per se; the reason for Tamar’s being forbidden to Amnon appears to lie elsewhere (Wenham). <b>to do anything:</b> To have sexual contact."
Ii Samuel 20:3,<b>Yonadav:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-nah-DAHV;</i> trad. English “Jonadab.” In v.5 the name has the alternate “Yehonadav.” <b>worldly-wise:</b> Heb. <i>h-k-m</i> connotes not only intellectual but also practical wisdom. See also 14:2ff. and 20:16 below.
Ii Samuel 20:4,"<b>Tamar—the sister …:</b> McCarter (198) notes how each word in this verse begins with the same letter (<i>alef</i>), producing “a series of gasping sighs,” and Rendsburg (1998–99) includes it as an example of (emotionally) “confused language.”"
Ii Samuel 20:5,"<b>heat … heartcakes:</b> Heb. <i>u-tlabbev levivot</i>. The verb appears also in the Song of Songs (4:9), to indicate sexual arousal. <b>heartcakes:</b> Heb. <i>levivot;</i> others, simply “cakes,” but the “heart” (Heb. <i>leiv, leivav</i>) motif is central to the Avshalom stories, as I have argued in the Introduction to this section. Shaped foods were known in the ancient Near East (Prof. Chaim Cohen, personal communication)."
Ii Samuel 20:6,<b>Have everyone go out:</b> The equivalent of “Clear the room!”
Ii Samuel 20:7,"<b>overpowered:</b> Or “took hold of.”
12–13 <b>such is not to be done … disgrace:</b> The same language is used in Gen. 34, the rape of Dina narrative. <b>vile thing … vile ones:</b> As in I Sam. 25; others understand as “foolishness … fools.” <b>he will not withhold me:</b> In order for her plea to have any force, such a thing must have been possible in royal society. Yet, as Sasson shows, it does not appear much outside of Egypt. He makes the intriguing conjecture that Tamar may have in fact been Avshalom’s daughter (see 14:27) and therefore Amnon’s niece, which would solve a number of the story’s problems."
Ii Samuel 20:8,<b>Get up! Go!:</b> With the force of “Get lost!” The wording is close to the horrifying “Get up! Let’s go!” that the Levite of Judg. 19:28 barks at his gang-raped and unconscious (if not dead) concubine.
Ii Samuel 20:9,"<b>About this great evil …:</b> The halting syntax here may be less a function of a defective text, as some have maintained, and more of Tamar’s emotional state (Kwitkin-Close, written communication, and Rendsburg 1998–99)."
Ii Samuel 20:10,<b>this one:</b> Note how the phrasing suggests contempt.
Ii Samuel 20:11,<b>ornamented tunic:</b> Like Joseph’s famous one in Gen. 37:3.
Ii Samuel 20:12,<b>For now:</b> Following Alter (1999).
Ii Samuel 20:13,<b>agitated:</b> Yet he apparently does not act further.
Ii Samuel 20:14,<b>Baal Hatzor:</b> Well north of Jerusalem. <b>Efrayim:</b> Presumably the name of another town; McCarter (1984) suggests an original name of “Ofra.”
Ii Samuel 20:15,<b>merry:</b> Elsewhere I use “in good-humor.”
Ii Samuel 20:16,"<b>mouth:</b> Or, as elsewhere, “order.”"
Ii Samuel 20:17,<b>Talmai:</b> His maternal grandfather.
Ii Samuel 20:18,"<b>the king’s spirit was spent for going out against:</b> MT has “David the King longed for,” but the verb is feminine, like “spirit” (<i>ru’ah</i>) in Hebrew, and “David” (Heb. <i>d-w-d</i>) could easily be an orthographic error for “spirit” (<i>r-w-h</i>). Some interpreters feel that David really is pining for Avshalom, but, as Alter (1999) points out, in the next chapter the king refuses to see him. <b>for he was dead:</b> Perhaps another indication of David’s ability to “move on” (see his reaction to his illegitimate son’s death in Chap. 12)—not necessarily an admirable trait, in this case.
The Wise Woman of Tekoa; Avshalom Returns: After some time passes, David’s commander Yoav, who throughout II Samuel acts in what he believes are the king’s best interests, now perceives that David is ripe for Avshalom to return to Jerusalem. But knowing David as he does, he apparently feels that the reconciliation cannot occur without some kind of subterfuge, or at least teaching the king a lesson. So, like Natan had done in Chap. 12, he concocts a story to draw David into the emotional heart of the situation. Enlisting a “worldly-wise woman,” Yoav lays out the fictional case of a sole surviving son, who, should he die at the hand of an angry family member, will by his death eradicate his father’s name and line from the world. David of course promises to protect the helpless woman and her son, but eventually comes to realize that the story is really about himself—as he had not perceived in the case of Natan’s little parable in Chap. 12.
The ultimate irony of the narrative is that father and son are brought together by the hardened warrior Yoav, yet it is he who will ultimately separate them forever, four chapters hence."
Ii Samuel 21:1,"And Yoav son of Tzeruya knew
that the king’s heart was toward Avshalom,"
Ii Samuel 21:2,"so Yoav sent to Tekoa;
he fetched from there a worldly-wise woman
and said to her:
Pray feign-mourning, pray clothe yourself in garments of mourning;
do not pour oil [on yourself],
but be like a woman [who] these many days has been mourning over the dead."
Ii Samuel 21:3,"You are to come to the king
and are to speak to him according to these words …
And Yoav put the words in her mouth."
Ii Samuel 21:4,"So the Tekoite woman talked to the king:
she flung herself on her nostrils to the earth and bowed low,
and said:
Deliver [me], O king!"
Ii Samuel 21:5,"The king said to her:
What [ails] you?
She said:
Alas, I am a widow woman—my husband died."
Ii Samuel 21:6,"Now your handmaid had two sons,
but the two of them scuffled in the open-field, with no rescuer between them;
the one struck down the other-one and caused his death."
Ii Samuel 21:7,"And here, the whole clan has arisen against your handmaid and has said:
Give over the one who struck down his brother,
that we may put him to death for the life of his brother, whom he killed;
we want to destroy [him]! Even the heir!
So they will extinguish my ember that remains,
providing no name or survivor for my husband on the face of the earth."
Ii Samuel 21:8,"The king said to the woman:
Go back to your house,
and I myself will issue-a-command regarding you."
Ii Samuel 21:9,"The Tekoite woman said to the king:
On me, my lord king, be the iniquity, and on my Father’s House,
but the king and his throne are clear [of blame]."
Ii Samuel 21:10,"The king said:
The one who speaks [amiss] to you, have him brought to me—
he will not continue to harm you!"
Ii Samuel 21:11,"She said:
Pray let the king be mindful of Y<small>HWH</small> your God
—too much might the blood redeemer bring-ruin—
so that they do not destroy my son!
He said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
if a hair of your son should fall to the ground … !"
Ii Samuel 21:12,"Then the woman said:
Pray let your handmaid speak a word to my lord king.
He said:
Speak."
Ii Samuel 21:13,"The woman said:
Now why have you planned in this way against God’s people?
By the king speaking this word, [he is] as one guilty,
by not letting his banished one return."
Ii Samuel 21:14,"For we will die, yes, die,
like water running on the ground, which cannot be gathered up.
But God will not carry a life away;
he will plan plans, to not keep the banished one banished from him."
Ii Samuel 21:15,"So-now,
[the reason] that I have come to speak this word to the king, my lord,
is that the people made me afraid.
Your handmaid said [to herself]: Let me now speak to the king;
perhaps the king will act on his maidservant’s word."
Ii Samuel 21:16,"Indeed, the king will hearken
to rescue his maidservant from the grasp of the [avenging] man,
from destroying me and my son together, away from God’s inheritance."
Ii Samuel 21:17,"And your handmaid said [to herself]:
Now may the word of my lord king be for [my] rest,
for like a messenger of God, so is my lord king,
to hear out the good and the evil—
may Y<small>HWH</small> your God be with you!"
Ii Samuel 21:18,"The king answered, he said to the woman:
Do not conceal from me a thing that I ask of you!
The woman said:
Pray let my lord king speak."
Ii Samuel 21:19,"The king said:
Is the hand of Yoav with you in all this?
The woman answered and said:
By your life, my lord king,
there is no turning-right or turning-left from all that my lord king has spoken;
indeed, your servant Yoav himself commanded me—
he himself put in the mouth of your handmaid all these words."
Ii Samuel 21:20,"In order to reverse the face of the matter
did your servant Yoav do this thing;
but my lord is wise,
like the wisdom of a messenger of God,
to know all that is on earth!"
Ii Samuel 21:21,"Then the king said to Yoav:
Here now, I have done this thing.
So go, return the lad Avshalom!

14:2 <b>Tekoa:</b> South of Bet-Lehem, or about ten miles south of Jerusalem, on the border between farmland and the desert. <b>a worldly-wise woman:</b> Another one appears at the end of the stories concerning Avshalom, Chap. 20. The Bible uses this kind of bracketing structure fairly often. <b>pour oil:</b> The application of oil was considered a part of personal hygiene in the ancient world. See note on 12:20, above."
Ii Samuel 21:22,"<b>your handmaid:</b> Showing suitable deference, by the speaker’s referring to herself in the third person."
Ii Samuel 21:23,"<b>Even the heir!:</b> Implying either that they don’t care that he <i>is</i> his father’s heir, or that they want to kill him for the property as well (Alter 1999). <b>my ember that remains:</b> In a memorable image, the last one left to carry on the family name. <b>survivor:</b> Or “remnant.”"
Ii Samuel 21:24,<b>too much:</b> The Hebrew is difficult here. <b>blood redeemer:</b> A member of a family or clan whose duty it was to avenge the death of a kinsman. <b>a hair of your son:</b> Avshalom’s own abundant hair will ultimately prove his undoing.
Ii Samuel 21:25,"<b>he will plan plans:</b> JPS understands the phrase to mean that God will not punish David, the one who “plans plans.”"
Ii Samuel 21:26,"<b>God’s inheritance:</b> Unlike the “Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance” in I Sam. 26:19 and II Sam. 20:19 and 21:3, this expression appears to refer to the ancestral estate (Lewis), or “the hereditary-property” from God."
Ii Samuel 21:27,"<b>my lord is wise:</b> Yet David’s ambiguous actions vis-à-vis Avshalom indicate that royal wisdom and control are in the process of unraveling.
David Driven from the Throne: With Chap. 13, the narrative came full circle from the violence of Judges, as that book’s chaos in a sense reappeared in the family sphere of David’s house (Fishbane). Yet now it will expand again to the nation as a whole, with Avshalom’s revolt against his father.
As frequently occurs in biblical narrative, this chapter is connected to the previous one by means of reprised words: “call,” “come,” “bow down,” and “kiss,” all in the first five verses (Bar-Efrat). More important, from the outset of the chapter it becomes clear that at this point Avshalom is seeking the throne itself. His strategy is the personal touch: he intercepts those people who come to Jerusalem for justice, assuring them of his personal concern, which he contrasts to David’s supposed disinterest. Thus he begins the process of “[stealing] away the heart of the men of Israel” (v.6). He does this cleverly, without vocally laying claim to the throne (see Ehrlich).
A second stage in Avshalom’s plan is to go, on a pretext, to Hevron, the original stronghold of David’s political power. Here he is able to marshal his public relations machine by sending “spy-runners” throughout the land to proclaim his accession to the throne, by successfully recruiting David’s adviser Ahitofel, and by increasing the number of his followers.
From here the chapter switches its focus to David. He is shown leading the flight from Jerusalem, and, rather pathetically, leaving ten of his concubines to symbolically guard the palace. Moreover, throughout this part of the story, David expresses an unusual tone of resignation. To his friend Ittai he describes his fate as “I am going wherever I am going” (v.20), and he has the precious Coffer returned to Jerusalem, not knowing whether he will ever see it and the city again.
Yet amid all the weeping for the king’s fate (vv.23 and 30), David the crafty politician reemerges, plotting to win back his throne. He prays to Y<small>HWH</small> to bring Ahitofel’s advice to naught, and instructs Hushai how to frustrate the evil designs of Ahitofel and his master."
Ii Samuel 21:28,"Yoav flung himself on his face to the ground and bowed low, and he blessed the king;
Yoav said:
Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord king,
[given] that the king has acted upon your servant’s word!"
Ii Samuel 21:29,"And Yoav arose and went to Geshur,
and he brought Avshalom to Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 21:30,"The king said:
Let him turn round to his house,
but my face he is not to see!
So Avshalom turned to his house,
but the king’s face he did not see."
Ii Samuel 21:31,"Now like Avshalom there was no man as beautiful throughout all Israel, so exceedingly to be praised;
from the sole of his foot to his crown,
there was no defect in him."
Ii Samuel 21:32,"When he shaved his head
—it used to be that at the end of the year, [every] year,
he would shave it, for it was heavy upon him and [he had] to shave it—
he would weigh the hair of his head: two hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights, by the king’s [weighing-]stone."
Ii Samuel 21:33,"And there were born to Avshalom three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar;
she was a woman beautiful of appearance."
Ii Samuel 21:34,"And Avshalom stayed in Jerusalem for two-years’ time,
but the king’s face he did not see."
Ii Samuel 21:35,"So Avshalom sent to Yoav, to send him to the king,
but he would not come to him.
He sent again, a second-time,
but he would not come."
Ii Samuel 21:36,"So he said to his servants:
See, Yoav’s plot is near me, and he has barley there;
go, kindle it with fire!
And Avshalom’s servants kindled the plot with fire."
Ii Samuel 21:37,"And Yoav arose and came to Avshalom at the house;
he said to him:
Why did your servants kindle the plot that belongs to me with fire?"
Ii Samuel 21:38,"Avshalom said to Yoav:
Here, I had sent [word] to you, saying:
Come here, I wish to send you to the king, to say:
Why did I come back from Geshur?
It would have been better for me [if] I were still there!
So-now,
let me see the king’s face,
and if there be any iniquity in me, let him put me to death!"
Ii Samuel 21:39,"So Yoav came to the king and told him,
and he called for Avshalom;
he came to the king and bowed low to him, on his nostrils to the earth, before the king,
and the king kissed Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 22:1,"It was, [some time] after this,
that Avshalom prepared himself a chariot and horses,
with fifty men running before him."
Ii Samuel 22:2,"And Avshalom would start-early;
he would stand by the road of the main-gate,
and it was that everyone who had a case-for-quarrel coming before the king, for judgment,
Avshalom would call to him, and would say:
From what town are you?
And he would say:
From a certain one of the tribes of Israel is your servant."
Ii Samuel 22:3,"Then Avshalom would say to him:
See, your words are good and correct,
but you have no one to hear on the part of the king!"
Ii Samuel 22:4,"And Avshalom said:
O who would make me judge in the land,
[that] every man might come to me who had a case-for-quarrel or a matter-for-judgment
—I would declare him in the right!"
Ii Samuel 22:5,"So it would be, when a man would come near, to bow low to him,
that he would stretch out his hand and take hold of him, and kiss him."
Ii Samuel 22:6,"And Avshalom did according to this matter for all Israel who would come for adjudication to the king;
thus Avshalom stole away the heart of the men of Israel."
Ii Samuel 22:7,"It was at the end of four years, that Avshalom said to the king:
Now let me go, that I may pay my vow that I vowed to Y<small>HWH</small> in Hevron,"
Ii Samuel 22:8,"for your servant vowed a vow when I stayed at Geshur in Aram, saying:
If Y<small>HWH</small> will let me return, yes, return to Jerusalem,
I will serve Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Samuel 22:9,"The king said to him:
Go in peace.
So he arose and went to Hevron."
Ii Samuel 22:10,"And Avshalom sent spy-runners throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying:
When you hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i>, you are to say:
Avshalom reigns as king in Hevron!"
Ii Samuel 22:11,"Now with Avshalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem,
invited-guests, going in their innocence—
they did not know anything."
Ii Samuel 22:12,"And Avshalom sent for Ahitofel the Gilonite, David’s adviser, from his town, from Gilo,
when he was sacrificing sacrifices.
Now the banding-in-conspiracy was powerful,
and the people with Avshalom went on [and on] becoming many."
Ii Samuel 22:13,"And a message-teller came to David, saying:
The heart of the men of Israel [inclines] after Avshalom!"
Ii Samuel 22:14,"So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem:
Arise, let us get away,
for we will have no remnant [left] before Avshalom!
Hurry and go,
lest he hurry and overtake us and push evil upon us
and strike the city with the mouth of the sword!"
Ii Samuel 22:15,"The king’s servants said to the king:
Just as my lord king chooses, here are your servants!"
Ii Samuel 22:16,"So the king and all his household went off on foot,
and the king left ten concubine women to guard the palace-house."
Ii Samuel 22:17,"And when the king and all the fighting-people went off on foot,
they stopped at the Far House."
Ii Samuel 22:18,"Now all his servants were crossing over next to him,
while all the Kereitites and all the Peleitites and all the Gittites,
six hundred men who came on foot from Gat,
were crossing over in front of the king."
Ii Samuel 22:19,"The king said to Ittai the Gittite:
Why will you go, even you, with us?
Return and stay with the king,
for you are a foreigner, and also you are an exile from your [own] place."
Ii Samuel 22:20,"[Just] yesterday was your coming,
so today, should I make you wander with us, in [our] going-forth?
I am going wherever I am going;
return, and have your brothers return with you,
in loyalty and faithfulness!"
Ii Samuel 22:21,"Ittai answered the king, he said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> lives and by the life of my lord king,
only in the place where my lord king is, whether for death or for life—
indeed, there your servant will be!"
Ii Samuel 22:22,"David said to Ittai:
Go, cross over!
So Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the families who were with him crossed over."
Ii Samuel 22:23,"Now the entire region was weeping in a great voice while all the fighting-people were crossing over,
while the king was crossing Wadi Kidron,
and while all the fighting-people were crossing over, facing the road to the wilderness."
Ii Samuel 22:24,"And here: also Tzadok and all the Levites with him were carrying the Coffer of the Covenant of God;
they set down the Coffer of God, and Evyatar also went up,
until all the people had completed crossing away from the city."
Ii Samuel 22:25,"The king said to Tzadok:
Return the Coffer of God to the city;
if I find favor in Y<small>HWH</small>’s eyes,
he will let me return and let me see it, along with his abode."
Ii Samuel 22:26,"If thus he says: I am not pleased with you,
here I am—
let him do with me as is good in his eyes."
Ii Samuel 22:27,"And the king said [further] to Tzadok the priest:
Are you a seer?
Return to the city in peace,
along with Ahimaatz your son and Yehonatan son of Evyatar
—your two sons with you [both]."
Ii Samuel 22:28,"See, I myself will tarry at the plains in the wilderness
until word comes from you, telling me [something]."
Ii Samuel 22:29,"So Tzadok and Evyatar returned the Coffer of God to Jerusalem,
and they stayed there.

David in Exile; Avshalom and the Concubines: As David crosses a natural border, reaching the far side of the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem, he is met by two men whose behavior demonstrates the king’s vulnerability. The first, Mefiboshet’s servant Tziva, uses a lie—that his master is supporting the rebellion out of the hopes of regaining the throne for his family—to try to obtain wealth for himself. The second, another relative of Sha’ul, Shim’i son of Gera, both curses and throws stones at David, yet the king’s response is to accept the abuse, as if to suggest that he has reached a nadir of power and self-respect.
At the same time, David’s plans for a return to power are bearing fruit, with the acceptance of his counselor Hushai by Avshalom toward the end of the chapter. This occurs amid Avshalom’s symbolic act of sleeping with his father’s concubines, always a sign of attempted or actual succession in biblical Israel (see Re’uven’s actions in Gen. 35:22 and Avner’s in II Sam. 3:7). But as Clines has noted, Avshalom’s move, given that it involves multiple women, may additionally be an exaggerated act of masculine bravado, beyond the merely symbolic political aspect."
Ii Samuel 23:17,"But David was going up the Ascent of Olives, going up and weeping;
his head was covered and he was walking barefoot,
while all the people who were with him covered each one his head,
and were going up, going up and weeping."
Ii Samuel 23:18,"Now David was told, saying:
Ahitofel is among those banding together with Avshalom!
David said:
Pray make-foolish Ahitofel’s advice, O Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Samuel 23:19,"Now it was, when David was coming to the summit, where [they] would bow down to God,
that here, [coming] to meet him was Hushai the Arkite, his tunic torn and earth on his head."
Ii Samuel 23:20,"David said to him:
If you cross over with me,
you will be a burden to me,"
Ii Samuel 23:21,"but if you return to the city
and say to Avshalom: Your servant O king, will I be—
servant to your father was I formerly,
but now I am your servant!—
then you may annul Ahitofel’s advice for me."
Ii Samuel 23:22,"Will not Tzadok and Evyatar, the priests, be with you there?
It will be
that all the words that you hear from the king’s house, you are to tell to Tzadok and Evyatar the priests;"
Ii Samuel 23:23,"here, their two sons, Ahimaatz of Tzadok and Yehonatan of Evyatar, are there with them;

Ii Samuel 23:24,"So Hushai the Friend of David entered the city
[just] as Avshalom was about to enter Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 24:1,"Now David had crossed a little beyond the summit
when here: Tziva, Mefiboshet’s retainer, [was coming] to meet him,
along with a brace of saddled donkeys,
and on them were two hundred bread-loaves, a hundred raisin-cakes, a hundred fig-cakes, and a skin of wine."
Ii Samuel 24:2,"The king said to Tziva:
What do you [mean] with these?
Tziva said:
The donkeys are for the king’s household, for riding,
the bread and the figs are for eating by the lads,
and the wine is for drinking by those weary in the wilderness."
Ii Samuel 24:3,"The king said:
And where is your lord’s son?
Tziva said to the king:
Here, he is sitting in Jerusalem,
for he says [to himself]: Today the House of Israel will return my father’s kingdom to me!"
Ii Samuel 24:4,"The king said to Tziva:
Here, yours is all that was Mefiboshet’s.
Tziva said:
I bow down!
May I find favor in your eyes, O my lord king!"
Ii Samuel 24:5,"Now when King David came to Bahurim,
here, a man was going out from there, from the clan of the House of Sha’ul;
his name was Shim’i son of Gera.
He was going out, going out and cursing—"
Ii Samuel 24:6,"and he pelted David with stones, and all of King David’s court-servants,
along with all the fighting-people and all the mighty-men to his right and to his left."
Ii Samuel 24:7,"And thus did Shim’i say when he cursed him:
Get out, get out, [you] bloodguilty man, [you] base man!"
Ii Samuel 24:8,"Y<small>HWH</small> has returned upon you all the bloodguilt of the House of Sha’ul, in whose place you reign as king,
and Y<small>HWH</small> has given the kingdom into the hand of Avshalom your son,
for here, you are in your evil-fate,
for you are a bloodguilty man!"
Ii Samuel 24:9,"Avishai son of Tzeruya said to the king:
Why should this dead dog curse my lord king?
Now let me cross over and take off his head!"
Ii Samuel 24:10,"But the king said:
What is there [in common] between me and you, O sons of Tzeruya?
Let him curse, for if Y<small>HWH</small> says to him: Curse David,
who is to say: For-what-reason do you do thus?"
Ii Samuel 24:11,"And David said to Avishai and to all his servants:
Here, my [own] son, who came out of my body, is seeking my life;
how much more, then, the Binyaminite!
Let him be, that he may curse,
for Y<small>HWH</small> told him to."
Ii Samuel 24:12,"Perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will look on my affliction
and Y<small>HWH</small> will return me good in place of his curses on this day!"
Ii Samuel 24:13,"David and his men went on the way;
but Shim’i was going along the side of the hill, next to him,
going along and cursing and pelting [him] with stones next to him
and dumping dust [on him]."
Ii Samuel 24:14,"And the king and all the people that were with him came back weary,
and they paused-for-breath there."
Ii Samuel 24:15,"Now Avshalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,
and Ahitofel was with him.

Hushai’s Advice; the Worm Turns: Avshalom now seeks counsel as to the right move in the burgeoning rebellion. The first opinion he solicits is that of Ahitofel, of whose reputation for solid advice in the past we have just learned (16:23). The plan is a sound one: to isolate and kill David, thus avoiding mass bloodshed and providing for a quick restoration of the peace. Inexplicably, however, the usurper instead accepts the advice of Hushai, which is to be wary of the experienced and tough old king and to amass an army and attack the town where he is to be found. Only at the end of Hushai’s proposal do we learn that Avshalom’s acceptance of the old man’s advice is actually YHWH’s doing (v.14). In practical terms, it gives David time to solidify his own plans and marshal his forces (Sweeney 2007).
David must be informed of the possibilities, and this is accomplished by means of two messengers, whose escape from Avshalom’s men in vv.18–21 is reminiscent of the story of Yehoshua’s spies slipping away in Josh. 2. The king subsequently decides to cross to the east bank of the Jordan to assure his safety.
The upshot of this episode is that Ahitofel kills himself, a rather rare event for the Bible, at least in a nonmilitary setting, and David begins to prepare for the coming battle by feeding his troops."
Ii Samuel 25:9,"And it was, when Hushai the Arkite, David’s Friend, came to Avshalom,
that Hushai said to Avshalom:
May the king live! May the king live!"
Ii Samuel 25:10,"Avshalom said to Hushai:
Is this your loyalty to your friend?
Why didn’t you go with your friend?"
Ii Samuel 25:11,"Hushai said to Avshalom:
No—
rather, the one whom Y<small>HWH</small> and his people, all the men of Israel, have chosen,
for him I will be, and with him I will stay!"
Ii Samuel 25:12,"And second, whom should I serve, if not in the presence of his son?
As I served in the presence of your father,
so I will serve in your presence."
Ii Samuel 25:13,"Avshalom said to Ahitofel:
Give advice, [both of] you—
what should we do?"
Ii Samuel 25:14,"Ahitofel said to Avshalom:
Come in to your father’s concubines, whom he left to guard the palace-house;
when all Israel hears that you have made yourself reek to your father,
then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened."
Ii Samuel 25:15,"So they spread out a tent for Avshalom on the roof,
and Avshalom came in to his father’s concubines, before the eyes of all Israel."
Ii Samuel 25:16,"Now the advice of Ahitofel which he advised
was in those days like inquiring of the word of God;
thus was all of Ahitofel’s advice, so for David, so for Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 26:1,"Ahitofel said to Avshalom:
Pray let me choose twelve thousand men,
and let me arise and pursue after David tonight."
Ii Samuel 26:2,"When I come upon him
and he is weary and slack of hands,
I will alarm him,
so that all the people that are with him will flee.
Then I will strike down the king alone,"
Ii Samuel 26:3,"and I will return all the people to you,
[so that] when all are returned
—the man whom you seek and all the fighting-people—
there will be peace."
Ii Samuel 26:4,"The word was right in Avshalom’s eyes
and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel."
Ii Samuel 26:5,"But Avshalom said:
Pray call as well Hushai the Arkite;
we will hear what is in his mouth, his as well."
Ii Samuel 26:6,"And Hushai came to Avshalom, and Avshalom said to him, saying:
In accordance with this word did Ahitofel speak;
shall we act on his word?
Or not? <i>You</i> speak!"
Ii Samuel 26:7,"Hushai said to Avshalom:
Not good is the advice that Ahitofel has advised this time."
Ii Samuel 26:8,"And Hushai said [further]:
You yourself know your father and his men,
that they are mighty ones,
and that they are bitter of feelings,
like a bear bereaved in the open-field,
and your father is a man of battle—
he will not spend-the-night with the people."
Ii Samuel 26:9,"Here now,
he is hiding in one of the pits or in one of the halting-places;
and it will be
when fighting-people fall at the start [of battle],
and a hearer hears and says:
There has been a defeat for the people who [follow] after Avshalom—"
Ii Samuel 26:10,"that even if he be a valiant one,
whose heart is like the heart of a lion,
he will melt, melt away [in fear].
For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty-man,
and valiant ones are with him!"
Ii Samuel 26:11,"So I advise:
let all Israel be gathered, yes, gathered to you, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,
like the sand that is by the sea in abundance,
with your presence walking among them."
Ii Samuel 26:12,"We will come upon him
in one of the places where he can be found,
and light upon him as dew falls upon the ground;
there will not be left to him, or to all the men that are with him, even one."
Ii Samuel 26:13,"Now if he gathers himself into a town,
then let all Israel bring ropes into that town
and let us drag it, as far as the wadi, until even a pebble cannot be found there!"
Ii Samuel 26:14,"Avshalom and all Israel said:
Better is the advice of Hushai the Arkite than the advice of Ahitofel!
—Now Y<small>HWH</small> had ordained to nullify the good advice of Ahitofel,
in order that Y<small>HWH</small> might bring an evil-fate upon Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 26:15,"And Hushai said to Tzadok and to Evyatar, the priests:
Like this and like that, Ahitofel advised Avshalom and the elders of Israel,
and like this and like that, I myself advised."
Ii Samuel 26:16,"So-now,
send quickly and tell David, saying:
Do not lodge tonight at the wilderness crossings,
by-all-means cross over, yes, cross over,
lest they be swallowed up, the king and all the people who are with him!

Avshalom’s Death: As the rebellion narrative moves toward its inevitable conclusion, David will not be present at the climactic moment, just as he was not present at the moment of Sha’ul’s death. His exclusion from the battle by his own soldiers, while couched in concern for his welfare, also suggests that he is no longer perceived as an effective military leader. It has the added effect of setting up the dramatic scene in which David learns the news about his son’s death, which in fact comprises the bulk of this chapter.
The battle scene itself, as usual, is brief, with the striking note that the forest swallowed up the rebels (v.8). More significant is the mode of Avshalom’s death, with its unforgettable image of the prince accidentally hanging from a tree. The two great theme words of the whole cycle, “head” and “heart,” come into play once again: he who had sought to become head of Israel, during his royal father’s lifetime, winds up hanging from his head, totally vulnerable to attack; and from having initially swayed the hearts of the people, he is struck “in the heart” as he hangs “in the heart” of a tree. Once again it is a son of Tzeruya, Yoav, who acts decisively and violently, to resecure the throne for David.
V.18 stands alone, perhaps as a postscript to Avshalom’s death, to at least provide a tangible memory of the charismatic prince. The monument mentioned here, known to the writer or final editor of Samuel, should not be confused with the “Absalom’s Tomb” that still stands in Jerusalem, in the valley east of the Old City. That structure dates from the much later Hellenistic period (second to first century <small>B</small>.<small>C</small>.<small>E</small>.).
For the narrator, the portrayal of how the bad news is brought to David is almost of equal weight to the relating of Avshalom’s actual death. In the Bible we have previously encountered a number of imagined and real battle messenger scenes, most notably with Sisera’s mother (Judg. 5) and Eli (I Sam. 4). Here, however, the drama is even more extreme. The king has repeatedly ordered his commanders and soldiers not to harm Avshalom, but we know that “the lad” is already dead. After some jockeying for the privilege of delivering the news—Ahimaatz, the usual messenger, is rejected by Yoav—the narrative speaks through the king’s perspective. Three pieces of information are passed by the watchman to David, who sits anxiously awaiting news of his son: the existence of one runner, then two, and then the identification of Ahimaatz. We know, but the king initially does not, that this time Ahimaatz will pass, and the fateful message will be delivered by the unnamed Cushite (foreigners have previously delivered bad news to David in I Sam. 30:1ff. and II Sam. 1:2ff.). Note that David’s only concern is for his son, not for his troops or the disposition of the rebellion. The actual news is delivered elliptically; unlike the earlier “also your servant Uriyya the Hittite is dead” (II 11:24), the messenger sees fit to say what he needs to by a circumlocution, although an obvious one: “May they be like that lad, my lord king’s enemies …” (v.32)."
Ii Samuel 26:26,"Now Yehonatan and Ahimaatz were staying at En-Rogel,
and a handmaid would go and tell them,
and they would go and tell King David,
for they could not be seen coming to the town."
Ii Samuel 26:27,"But a serving-lad saw them and told Avshalom,
so the two of them went quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim;
he had a well in his courtyard,
and they went down there."
Ii Samuel 26:28,"And the woman fetched and spread a screen over the mouth of the well,
and she scattered some groats over it,
so that nothing was noticeable."
Ii Samuel 26:29,"So when Avshalom’s servants came to the woman in the house,
and they said: Where are Ahimaatz and Yehonatan?
the woman said to them:
They have [already] crossed the pond of water.
They sought but did not find [them],
so they returned to Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 26:30,"Now it was, after their going away,
that they came up out of the well, and went and told King David;
they said to David:
Arise and quickly cross the water,
for thus-and-so has Ahitofel advised concerning you."
Ii Samuel 26:31,"So David arose, and all the people who were with him;
they crossed the Jordan, till the light of daybreak,
until there was no one left behind who had not crossed the Jordan."
Ii Samuel 26:32,"Now when Ahitofel saw that his advice had not been acted upon,
he saddled a donkey, and arose and went to his house, to his town;
and he gave charge regarding his household, and then he strangled himself, so that he died.
He was buried in the burial-place of his father."
Ii Samuel 26:33,"When David had come to Mahanayim, Avshalom crossed the
Jordan, he and all the fighting-men of Israel with him."
Ii Samuel 26:34,"As for Amasa, Avshalom put him in place of Yoav, [The One] Over the Armed-Forces
—Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Yitra the Yizre’elite,
who had come in to Avigayil daughter of Nahash, sister of Tzeruya, Yoav’s mother."
Ii Samuel 26:35,Now Israel and Avshalom encamped in the region of Gil’ad.
Ii Samuel 26:36,"And it was, when David came to Mahanayim,
that Shovi son of Nahash from Rabba of the Children of Ammon
and Makhir son of Ammiel from Lo-Devar and Barzillai the Gil’adite from Rogelim"
Ii Samuel 26:37,"brought forward couches and basins and potter’s vessels,
and wheat and barley and meal and parched-grain,
and beans and lentils,"
Ii Samuel 26:38,"and honey and curds and sheep and cheese from cattle for David
and for the people that were with him, to eat,
for they had said:
The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness!"
Ii Samuel 27:1,"And David counted [for battle] the fighting-people who were with him;
he put over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds."
Ii Samuel 27:2,"And David sent out the fighting-people:
a third in the hand of Yoav,
a third in the hand of Avishai son of Tzeruya, Yoav’s brother,
and a third in the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
The king said to the fighting-people:
I will go out, yes, go out, even I myself, with you!"
Ii Samuel 27:3,"But the people said:
You are not to go out,
for if we have to flee, yes, flee,
they will not take us to heart,
and [even] if half of us die,
they will not take us to heart;
but <i>you</i> are like us ten thousandfold!
So-now, it is better if you are [there] for us in the town, to provide-help."
Ii Samuel 27:4,"The king said to them:
Whatever is good in your eyes, I will do.
So the king stood by the gate,
while all the fighting-people went out by the hundreds and by the thousands."
Ii Samuel 27:5,"And the king charged Yoav and Avishai and Ittai, saying:
Go-gently for me on the lad, on Avshalom!
And all the people heard the charge of the king to all the commanders on the matter of Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 27:6,"The fighting-people went out into the open-country to meet Israel;
the battle occurred in the forest of Efrayim."
Ii Samuel 27:7,"And the fighting-people of Israel were defeated there, before David’s servants;
there occurred there a great defeat on that day—twenty thousand [dead]."
Ii Samuel 27:8,"And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the ground;
more did the forest devour among the fighting-people than the sword devoured on that day."
Ii Samuel 27:9,"And Avshalom chanced upon David’s servants:
Avshalom was riding on a mule,
and the mule came under the thick-boughs of a great oak,
and his head became held fast in the oak,
so that he was left hanging between heaven and earth,
while the mule that was under him crossed on."
Ii Samuel 27:10,"A man saw it and told Yoav;
he said:
Here, I saw Avshalom hanging from an oak!"
Ii Samuel 27:11,"Yoav said to the man, the one telling him:
Now here, you saw [him]—
so for-what-reason didn’t you strike him down there to the ground?
I would have to have given you ten pieces-of-silver and a belt!"
Ii Samuel 27:12,"The man said to Yoav:
Even if I were feeling-the-weight in my palms of a thousand pieces-of-silver,
I would not stretch out my hand against the king’s son,
for it was in our ears that the king charged you and Avishai and Ittai, saying:
Guard the lad, Avshalom, for me!"
Ii Samuel 27:13,"Else I would have been dealing falsely with my own life,
for nothing is hidden from the king—
yet you, you were standing aloof!"
Ii Samuel 27:14,"Yoav said:
I will not wait around like this before you!
So he took three rods in his palm
and thrust them into Avshalom’s heart
—he was still alive in the heart of the oak."
Ii Samuel 27:15,"And ten fighting-lads, Yoav’s weapons bearers, surrounded him;
they struck Avshalom and put him to death."
Ii Samuel 27:16,"Then Yoav sounded a thrusting-blast on the <i>shofar</i>,
so that the fighting-people turned back from pursuing after Israel,
for Yoav held back the people."
Ii Samuel 27:17,"They took Avshalom
and threw him in the forest, into a great pit,
and set up over him a heap of stones, exceedingly large,
while all Israel fled, each to his tent."
Ii Samuel 27:18,"Now Avshalom had undertaken to set up for himself, during
his lifetime, the standing-stone that is in the King’s Valley,
for he had said [to himself]: I have no son through whom to have my name recalled.
So he called the standing-stone by his name—
it is called Avshalom’s Monument until this day."
Ii Samuel 27:19,"Now Ahimaatz son of Tzadok said:
Pray let me run and bring-the-news to the king
that Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought justice for him from the hand of his enemies!"
Ii Samuel 27:20,"Yoav said to him:
You are not to be a man of news on this day;
you may bring-news on another day,
but on this day, you are not to bring-news,
since the king’s son is dead."
Ii Samuel 27:21,"Yoav said to a Cushite:
Go, tell the king what you have seen.
The Cushite bowed low to Yoav and ran off."
Ii Samuel 27:22,"But once again Ahimaatz son of Tzadok said to Yoav:
Come what may, pray let me run, me too, after the Cushite.
Yoav said:
Why should you run, my son,
when you have no news [that] will find [you favor]?

David Shaken and Restored to Power: Few scenes of grief in literature are as affecting as the one with which this chapter opens. The king’s emotions are conveyed largely through the use of sound (see note to v.1); the multiple repetitions of “my son” ring true, since grieving is by nature an obsessive process. While the reader’s sympathy is with the king, Yoav brings us back to brutal reality by emphasizing that this is no time for David to appear weak. With stinging words he reprimands the king for putting his own emotions above those of political necessity; in Yoav’s view, by excessively mourning his (unworthy) son, David is compromising his leadership and indeed ignoring his subjects’ own needs.
After finally composing himself, David attempts to repair the fractures in his kingdom. In order to placate the northerners, he appoints Avshalom’s erstwhile commander Amasa to replace Yoav. There may well be other motives at play here, given the troubled history between king and general; David must be aware that Yoav had dealt the initial blows to Avshalom as he hung from the tree. He assures Shim’i ben Gera, who had cursed him as a “bloodguilty man” in Chap. 16, that he will not be executed. Sha’ul’s grandson Mefiboshet appears, unkempt, and excuses his absence during the rebellion by pointing to his servant Tziva’s deception (see 16:1–4); subsequently, David reverses his earlier decision and restores to Mefiboshet at least some of his property. And a last piece of resolution takes place when Barzillai, the king’s faithful friend who had supported him materially during his flight, elects to remain at home rather than come to Jerusalem, citing his advanced age. His fatigue perhaps reflects the king’s own.
Yet the chapter still ends with conflict, at least of a verbal kind. The northerners are miffed at not being the ones to conduct David back across the Jordan. As the majority of Israel’s population, they feel entitled, but in the end, the Judahites’ “rougher” words prevail."
Ii Samuel 27:43,"… Come what may, I want to run!
So he said to him: Run!
And Ahimaatz ran by way of the Oval, and passed the Cushite."
Ii Samuel 27:44,"Now David was sitting between the two gateways,
and the watchman on the roof of the gate went over to the [city] wall;
he lifted up his eyes and saw: here, a man was running alone."
Ii Samuel 27:45,"The watchman called out and told the king,
and the king said:
If he is alone, [there is] news in his mouth.
And he went, going along and coming nearer,"
Ii Samuel 27:46,"but the watchman saw another man running;
the watchman called out to the gatekeeper
and said:
Here, [another] man is running alone!
The king said:
This one too is bringing-news."
Ii Samuel 27:47,"The watchman said:
I see [that] the running of the first-one is like the running of Ahimaatz son of Tzadok.
The king said:
He is a good man, and with good news he comes!"
Ii Samuel 27:48,"Ahimaatz called out and said to the king: Peace!
And he bowed low to the king, his nostrils to the ground,
and said:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
who has turned over the men who lifted their hand against my lord king!"
Ii Samuel 27:49,"The king said:
Is there peace with the lad, with Avshalom?
Ahimaatz said:
I saw a great commotion when Yoav sent off the king’s servant and your servant,
but I do not know what [it was]."
Ii Samuel 27:50,"The king said:
Turn around, station yourself here.
He turned around and stopped."
Ii Samuel 27:51,"And here, the Cushite came,
and the Cushite said:
Let my lord king receive-the-news
that Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought justice for you today from the hand of all those rising against you!"
Ii Samuel 27:52,"The king said to the Cushite:
Is there peace with the lad, with Avshalom?
The Cushite said:
May they be like that lad, my lord king’s enemies and all those who have risen against you for evil!"
Ii Samuel 28:1,"The king was shaken;
he went up to the upper-part of the gate and wept,
and thus he said as he went:
My son Avshalom,
my son, my son Avshalom!
Who will grant my dying, myself, in your place?
Avshalom, my son, my son!"
Ii Samuel 28:2,"And it was told to Yoav:
Here, the king is weeping and mourning over Avshalom."
Ii Samuel 28:3,"Now the victory became mourning on that day for all the people,
for the people heard on that day, saying:
The king is in pain over his son."
Ii Samuel 28:4,"So the people stole away on that day, while coming into the city
as humiliated fighting-people steal away when they flee in battle."
Ii Samuel 28:5,"Now the king wrapped his face,
and the king cried out in a loud voice:
My son Avshalom,
Avshalom, my son, my son!"
Ii Samuel 28:6,"Yoav came to the king in the palace-house,
and said:
Today you have shamed the face of all your servants
who helped you escape with your life today
and the life of your sons and your daughters, and the life of your wives, and the life of your concubines—"
Ii Samuel 28:7,"by loving those-who-hate-you, and by hating those-who-love-you!
For you have declared today that you have no commanders or servants;
for today I know that if Avshalom were alive, and all of us today were dead,
indeed, then it would be right in your eyes!"
Ii Samuel 28:8,"So-now, get up, go out
and speak to the heart of your servants,
for by Y<small>HWH</small> I swear, that [if] you do not go out,
no man will lodge with you tonight,
and this will be more evil for you
than all the evils that have come upon you from your youth until now!"
Ii Samuel 28:9,"So the king got up and sat at the gate,
while to all the people they declared, saying:
Here, the king is sitting at the gate!
And all the people came before the king.
Now Israel had fled, each one to his tent;"
Ii Samuel 28:10,"and it was that all the people were in strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying:
The king rescued us from the hand of our enemies,
and he himself helped us escape from the hand of the Philistines;
but now he had to run away from the land, from Avshalom,"
Ii Samuel 28:11,"while Avshalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle!
So-now,
why are you keeping silent about having the king return?"
Ii Samuel 28:12,"Now King David sent to Tzadok and Evyatar the priests, saying:
Speak to the elders of Judah, saying:
Why should you be the last to return the king to his house?
—For the words of all Israel had come to the king, to his house.—"
Ii Samuel 28:13,"You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh;
so why should you be the last to return the king?"
Ii Samuel 28:14,"And to Amasa, say:
Are you not my bone and my flesh?
Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add,
if you do not become commander of the armed-forces before me all the days [to come], in place of Yoav."
Ii Samuel 28:15,"Thus he inclined the heart of all the men of Judah, as one man;
they sent [word] to the king:
Return, you and all your servants!"
Ii Samuel 28:16,"So the king returned and came to the Jordan,
while Judah came to Gilgal to go and meet the king,
to conduct the king across the Jordan."
Ii Samuel 28:17,"And Shim’i son of Gera, the Binyaminite who was from Bahurim, hurried out;
he went down with the men of Judah to meet King David,"
Ii Samuel 28:18,"and a thousand men were with him from Binyamin,
along with Tziva, the retainer from the House of Sha’ul,
and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him;
they advanced to the Jordan ahead of the king,"
Ii Samuel 28:19,"while the river-crossing was being crossed, in order to conduct the king’s household across,
to do what was good in his eyes.
Now Shim’i son of Gera flung himself down before the king, as he was crossing the Jordan;"
Ii Samuel 28:20,"he said to the king:
Do not impute iniquity to me, my lord,
do not call-to-mind what your servant iniquitously-did on the day that my lord king went out from Jerusalem,
that the king should take it to heart!"
Ii Samuel 28:21,"For your servant knows that I myself sinned,
but here: I have come today, as the first of the entire House of Yosef,
going down to meet my lord king!"
Ii Samuel 28:22,"Avishai son of Tzeruya spoke up and said:
For that, should not Shim’i be put to death?
Indeed, he cursed Y<small>HWH</small>’s anointed one!"
Ii Samuel 28:23,"David said:
What is there between me and you, O sons of Tzeruya,
that you have become an adversary to me?
Today should a man be put to death in Israel?
Indeed, do I not know that today I am king over Israel?"
Ii Samuel 28:24,"The king said to Shim’i:
You will not die!
And the king swore-an-oath to him."
Ii Samuel 28:25,"Now Mefiboshet [grand]son of Sha’ul went down to meet the king
—he had not done his toenails, he had not done his mustache,
and his garments he had not scrubbed,
from the day of the king’s going away until the day that he came back in peace—"
Ii Samuel 28:26,"and it was, when he came from Jerusalem to meet the king
that the king said to him:
Why did you not go with me, Mefiboshet?"
Ii Samuel 28:27,"He said:
My lord king, my servant deceived me;
for your servant said [to himself]:
I will have my donkey saddled and ride it, and I will go to the king—
though your servant is lame."
Ii Samuel 28:28,"But he slandered your servant to my lord king;
yet my lord king is like a messenger of God—
so do as is good in your eyes."
Ii Samuel 28:29,"For all my father’s household were nothing but men [deserving] death from my lord king;
yet you have set your servant among those eating at your table!
So what right do I still have to cry out to the king?"
Ii Samuel 28:30,"The king said to him:
Why are you still speaking your words?
I have decided:
you and Tziva are to divide the fielded-property.

Ii Samuel 28:31,"<b>… Come what may:</b> It appears that a few words are missing, on the order of “He said/replied.” <b>the Oval:</b> The lower Jordan Valley."
Ii Samuel 28:32,"<b>between the two gateways:</b> Fokkelman (1981) takes this as a symbol of David’s ambivalence regarding Avshalom. It also recalls, as many have noted, one of the early scenes in Samuel, Eli awaiting news of the Coffer (I 4:13ff.)."
Ii Samuel 28:33,"<b>Is there peace …?:</b> Or “Is he well? Is it well with him?,” but, as the reader recalls, “peace” is part of the young man’s name. <b>when Yoav sent off the king’s servant …:</b> The Hebrew appears garbled here; it could be “to send off the king’s servant Yoav and your servant.” Alter (1999) suggests that it reflects emotional confusion in the messenger."
Ii Samuel 29:1,"<b>My son Avshalom, / my son, my son, Avshalom!:</b> The sound of the phrase is more memorable in Hebrew than in the usual English: Hebrew uses long vowels (<i>benEE avshaLOM / benEE benEE avshaLOM</i>), with last syllables accented, to echo the grief. <b>Who will grant my dying:</b> I.e., “if only I had died.”"

Second Rebellion: Avshalom’s revolt has once again exposed the historic rift between north and south, a divide which does not end with his death. A Binyaminite named Sheva starts another rebellion; when David asks his new commander Amasa to call the Judahites together to respond, he acts slowly, which is enough to convince his predecessor Yoav that he is betraying the king. Yoav’s brutal murder of Amasa dominates this chapter: the picture of the general wallowing in his blood by the side of the road is the first of two graphic images here strongly making the point that rebellion against David will not be countenanced, at least not by Yoav. The second example made of a rebel begins in v.14, and finds Sheva taking refuge up north in the town of Avel of Bet-Maakha. As Avshalom’s return to Jerusalem, and hence the seeds of the revolt, had begun with a story about a “wise woman” (Chap. 14), so the cycle of rebellion ends with one. Here the woman is able to fend off Yoav’s destructive urges and save her town by killing the rebel. What originated as an assault on the head of Israel draws to a close with the sight of a head flying off the ramparts of an Israelite town.
As the chapter ends, there is a second list of David’s officials (the first had capped Chap. 8). This time, in addition to a new Herald, we have a brand-new office: “[The One] Over the Labor-Gangs.” With the introduction of large-scale planning, Israel is moving from a fledgling state to something closer to the real thing, with institutions of centralized control. And with this “bureaucratic bookend” (Hamilton), we come to the end of the central account of David’s tenure as king."
Ii Samuel 29:10,"Mefiboshet said to the king:
Let him just take all of it,
seeing that my lord has come back in peace to his house!"
Ii Samuel 29:11,"Now Barzillai the Gil’adite had come down from Rogelim
and had crossed the Jordan with the king, to send him off at the Jordan."
Ii Samuel 29:12,"And Barzillai was exceedingly old, at eighty years;
he had provided for the king when he had stayed at Mahanayim,
for he was a man of exceedingly great-wealth."
Ii Samuel 29:13,"The king said to Barzillai:
You, cross over with me, and I will provide for you beside me in Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 29:14,"But Barzillai said to the king:
How many [more] are the days and years of my life,
that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
Ii Samuel 29:15,"I am eighty years old today;
do I know between good and evil?
Or does your servant taste what I eat or what I drink?
Or do I still hearken to the voice of male-singers or female-singers?
So why should your servant still be a burden to my lord king?"
Ii Samuel 29:16,"Scarcely could your servant cross the Jordan with the king,
so why does the king reward me with this reward?"
Ii Samuel 29:17,"Now let your servant return, that I may die in my town,
beside the burial-place of my father and my mother.
But here is your servant Kimham—
let him cross over with my lord king,
and then do for him that which is good in your eyes."
Ii Samuel 29:18,"The king said:
With me, Kimham shall cross,
and I myself will do for him what is good in your eyes;
whatever you choose for me, I will do for you!"
Ii Samuel 29:19,"So all the fighting-people crossed the Jordan,
and when the king was about to cross over,
the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him,
and he returned to his place."
Ii Samuel 29:20,"Then the king crossed over to Gilgal, and Kimham crossed over with him.
Now all the fighting-people of Judah had conducted the king across,
and also half the fighting-people of Israel."
Ii Samuel 29:21,"And here, all the men of Israel were coming to the king;
they said to the king:
Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, stolen you away
and conducted the king and his household across the Jordan,
and all of David’s men with him?"
Ii Samuel 29:22,"All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel:
Because the king is closely-related to me!
Why are you so agitated about this matter?
Have we eaten, yes, eaten any of the king[’s food]?
Or has any been carried, yes, carried off to us?"
Ii Samuel 29:23,"The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, they said:
I have ten shares in the king,
yes, in David, I more than you;
so why do you insult me?
Was not my word, mine, the first for having my king return?
But the words of Judah’s men were rougher than the words of Israel’s men."
Ii Samuel 30:1,"Now there chanced to be a base man there—his name was Sheva son of Bikhri, a Binyaminite man;
he gave-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i> and said:
We have no portion in David,
nor inheritance for us in the son of Yishai;
everyone to his tents, O Israel!"
Ii Samuel 30:2,"So all the men of Israel went up from [following] after David, [to following] after Sheva son of Bikhri,
while the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem."
Ii Samuel 30:3,"And David came to his palace-house in Jerusalem.
The king took the ten concubine women whom he had left to guard the house
and put them in a house under guard and provided for them,
but he did not come in to them,
for they were tied off until the day of their death in living widowhood."
Ii Samuel 30:4,"Then the king said to Amasa:
Summon to me the men of Judah, in three days,
then you—stop here."
Ii Samuel 30:5,"Amasa went to summon Judah,
but he delayed from the appointed-time that he had appointed."
Ii Samuel 30:6,"And David said to Avishai:
Now,
Sheva son of Bikhri will be more evil for us than Avshalom!
So you, take your lord’s servants and pursue after him,
lest he find himself fortified towns, and cast-shadows over our eye!"
Ii Samuel 30:7,"So Yoav’s men went out after him,
with the Kereitites and the Peleitites and all the mighty-men;
they went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Sheva son of Bikhri."
Ii Samuel 30:8,"When they were beside the great rock that is in Giv’on,
Amasa came up in front of them.
Now Yoav was girded in his garb, his [military] dress,
and on him was a girded sword bound on his loins, in its sheath;
when he went out, it fell down."
Ii Samuel 30:9,"And Yoav said to Amasa:
Are you in peace, my brother?
And Yoav’s right hand took hold of Amasa’s beard, to kiss him,"
Ii Samuel 30:10,"but Amasa did not guard himself from the sword that was in Yoav’s [other] hand,
and he struck him with it in the abdomen, so that his innards poured out on the ground;
—he did not [have to] do it to him a second-time—and so he died.
Now Yoav and Avishai his brother pursued after Sheva son of Bikhri,"
Ii Samuel 30:11,"while a man was standing by him from the serving-lads of Yoav;
he said:
Whoever desires Yoav, and whoever is for David—[follow] after Yoav!"
Ii Samuel 30:12,"Now Amasa was rolling in blood in the middle of the road;
and the man saw that all the people were stopping,
so he turned Amasa over from the road into the open-field, and threw a garment over him
—when anyone who came by saw him, he would stop."
Ii Samuel 30:13,"When he had pushed him out of the road,
all the men who were [following] after Yoav crossed over to pursue after Sheva son of Bikhri."
Ii Samuel 30:14,"They crossed throughout all the tribes of Israel to Avel of Bet-Maakha, to all the Bikhrites,
and assembled and came just after him."
Ii Samuel 30:15,"They came and besieged him, in Avel of Bet-Maakha:
they cast up a mound against the town, and stopped at the rampart,
while all the fighting-people who were with Yoav were bringing-ruin, to cause the wall to fall."
Ii Samuel 30:16,"But a wise woman called out from the town:
Hearken! Hearken!
Now say to Yoav:
Come near to here—I would speak with you!"
Ii Samuel 30:17,"He came near to her.
The woman said:
Are you Yoav?
He said:
I am.
She said to him:
Hearken to the words of your maidservant.
He said:
I am hearkening."
Ii Samuel 30:18,"She said, saying:
They used to speak, yes, speak formerly, saying:
When they inquired, yes, inquired in Avel,
thus they ended [the matter]!"
Ii Samuel 30:19,"<i>I</i> [am of] those most at peace, most trustworthy in Israel;
<i>you</i> seek to deal death to a town, a mother-city in Israel!
Why would you swallow up Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance?"
Ii Samuel 30:20,"Yoav answered and said:
[Heaven] forbid, forbid for me, if I cause it to be swallowed up, if I bring-ruin!"
Ii Samuel 30:21,"Not so is the matter,
but a man from the highlands of Efrayim, Sheva son of Bikhri his name,
has lifted his hand against the king, against David.
Give up him alone, and I will go from the town!
The woman said to Yoav:
Here, his head will be thrown to you by way of the wall."
Ii Samuel 30:22,"And the woman came to all the people with her wisdom,
and they cut off the head of Sheva son of Bikhri and threw it to Yoav;
then he sounded-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>,
and they scattered from the town, each one to his tents,
while Yoav returned to Jerusalem, to the king."
Ii Samuel 30:23,"Now Yoav was [The One] Over All the Armed-Forces of Israel,
while Benaya son of Yehoyada was [The One] Over the Kereitites and Over the Peleitites,"
Ii Samuel 30:24,"and Adoram was [The One] Over the Labor-Gangs,
and Yehoshafat son of Ahilud was the Herald,"
Ii Samuel 30:25,"and Sh’va was Scribe,
and Tzadok and Evyatar were priests,
while also ’Ira the Ya’irite was priest to David.

Revenge on the House of Sha’ul; Battles with the Philistines: After all the bloodshed that has occurred in Samuel, one piece of unfinished business remains. The text chooses this point to recount a symbolic execution—that of seven sons of Sha’ul—and uses the men of Giv’on (Gibeon) as the means to that end. In a story that does not appear elsewhere in the Bible, we are informed that Sha’ul, in contravention of the treaty with the Giv’onites that had been concluded in Josh. 9:15, had sought to destroy them. Now they demand a kind of blood vengeance, which David permits in order to stay the famine that is ravaging the land. One must again wonder at bloody deeds which benefit David but in which he does not wield the sword, and at the fact that he uses an oracle to shift the responsibility.
In an opposite vein, a final demonstration of David’s magnanimity concerns the bodies of the executed men. The action of Sha’ul’s concubine Ritzpa, who protects the corpses of both her own two sons and those of Sha’ul’s daughter Merav, is a deed of compassion and heroism, stretching as it does from spring to fall in the heart of the hot, dry season, and is met by David’s realization that all of Sha’ul’s family should be interred together in the family plot. This provides a closure which had been lacking since Sha’ul’s death, since he and the sons who had fallen in battle with him had remained buried under a tree in Yavesh-Gil’ad since I Sam. 31. But in truth, the burial is the final nail in the Saulide coffin.
The chapter concludes with four brief accounts of battle with the Philistines which appear to look back chronologically. In the first, David is actually taken captive, only to be rescued by Yoav’s brother Avishai. This episode is followed by Israelite victories over various foes—huge warriors with sometimes unusual physical characteristics (see v.20). Golyat is mentioned again; in this version he is slain not by the youthful David but by a certain Elhanan (see the Comments to I Sam. 17, above)."
Ii Samuel 32:1,"Now there was a famine in David’s days, for three years, year after year,
and David besought the face of Y<small>HWH</small>.
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Because of Sha’ul and because of the House of Bloodguilt,
because he caused the death of the Giv’onites … !"
Ii Samuel 32:2,"So the king called for the Giv’onites and said to them
—now the Giv’onites were not from the Children of Israel,
but rather from the remnant of the Amorites,
yet the Children of Israel had sworn [an oath] to them;
but Sha’ul had sought to strike them down, in his zeal for the Children of Israel and Judah—"
Ii Samuel 32:3,"David said to the Giv’onites:
What shall I do for you?
In what [way] may I effect-atonement,
so that they may bless Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance?"
Ii Samuel 32:4,"The Giv’onites said to him:
We have no [wish for] silver or gold with Sha’ul or with his house,
and we have no [wish to] put any man to death in Israel!
He said:
Whatever you say, I will do for you."
Ii Samuel 32:5,"They said to the king:
The man who [wanted to] destroy us,
who intended for us [that] we should be wiped out from remaining in all the territory of Israel:"
Ii Samuel 32:6,"let there be given to us seven men of his descendants,
and we will impale them to Y<small>HWH</small> at Giv’a of Sha’ul, the chosen one of Y<small>HWH</small>!
The king said:
I myself will give [them over]."
Ii Samuel 32:7,"But the king spared Mefiboshet son of Yehonatan son of Sha’ul,
because of the sworn-oath of Y<small>HWH</small> that was between them, between David and Yehonatan son of Sha’ul."
Ii Samuel 32:8,"So the king took the two sons of Ritzpa daughter of Aya, whom she had borne to Sha’ul, Armoni and Mefiboshet,
and the five sons of Merav daughter of Sha’ul, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholatite,"
Ii Samuel 32:9,"and gave them into the hand of the Giv’onites;
they impaled them on the hill, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and the seven of them fell together.
—Now they were put to death at the time of the harvest, the first
days, at the start of the barley harvest.—"
Ii Samuel 32:10,"And Ritzpa daughter of Aya took sackcloth

from the start of the harvest until water poured out on them from the heavens;
she did not allow the birds of the heavens to alight on them by day
or the wildlife of the open-field by night."
Ii Samuel 32:11,"And David was told what Ritzpa daughter of Aya, Sha’ul’s concubine, had done,"
Ii Samuel 32:12,"so David went
and took the bones of Sha’ul and the bones of Yehonatan his son from the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil’ad,
who had stealthily-taken them from the square of Bet-Shan,
where the Philistines had hung them up at the time that the Philistines struck down Sha’ul at Gilboa;"
Ii Samuel 32:13,"he brought up from there the bones of Sha’ul and the bones of Yehonatan his son,
and they gathered the bones of the impaled ones."
Ii Samuel 32:14,"Then they buried the bones of Sha’ul and of Yehonatan his son
in the land of Binyamin, in the side-chamber of the burial-place of Kish his father.
And when they had done all that the king had commanded them,
God let-himself-be-entreated for the land after that."
Ii Samuel 32:15,"Now there were battles again by the Philistines with Israel;
David went down, his servants with him,
and they did battle with the Philistines.
But David was weary,"
Ii Samuel 32:16,"and he was taken captive by Benov, who was of the descendants of the Shades
—the weight of his lance was three hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights of bronze,
while he was girded in new [armor]—
he intended to strike David down,"
Ii Samuel 32:17,"but Avishai son of Tzeruya came to his help:
he struck down the Philistine and put him to death.
Then David’s men swore [an oath] to him, saying:
You must not go out with us again into battle;
you must not extinguish the lamp of Israel!"
Ii Samuel 32:18,"It was [some time] after this
that there was battle again, in Gov, with the Philistines.
And Sibbekhai the Hushatite struck down Saf, who was of the descendants of the Shades."
Ii Samuel 32:19,"And there was battle again in Gov, with the Philistines,
and Elhanan son of Yaarei-Oregim the Bet-Lehemite struck down Golyat the Gittite

Ii Samuel 32:20,"And there was battle again in Gat:
and there was an immense man—

David’s Song of Deliverance: The placement of poetry toward the end of a long section or book occurs a number of times in the Bible (see, for instance, Gen. 49 and Exod. 15). This chapter also serves as a bracket for the entire book, as noted in the Comments to II 1, above. In fact, it echoes both vocabulary and themes from the earlier Song of Hanna (Fokkelman 1999), down to the detail that both conclude with mention of “his anointed one” (v.51 and 2:10) (Fishbane).
Additionally, this “song” is a virtual compendium of Israelite poetic ideas. The writer takes the time to build up the impressive manifestation of God in a manner that would have been familiar to many groups in the region; David’s God thunders in much the same manner as the Canaanite/Phoenician Baal. The divine appearance is in response to a beleaguered and despairing protagonist, who is so often the focus of biblical poetry from Jeremiah, Psalms, Lamentations, and Job, to cite just a few outstanding examples. Whether David was the writer or not, the poem’s imagery seems to fit him and his struggles nicely: from a state of being surrounded by enemies, he is able to triumph, especially militarily; he keeps faith with God in wholeness of heart (conveniently, the Bat-Sheva incident is ignored); and he is assured of God’s perpetual favor in the end.
Fishbane rightly stresses the “rock” imagery used here for God, and notes that, while it is used frequently in the Psalms, its appearance in this chapter focuses on hope rather than on a desperate plea for rescue."

David’s “Last Words”; His Warriors: A much briefer poem opens this chapter (vv.1–7). Strikingly, its initial words recall the prophet Bil’am’s inspired vision of a peaceful, secure Israel in Num. 22–24. The poem touts the theme of God’s reassurance, presenting mainly the natural imagery of light and growth for David himself, and concluding with a fiery portrayal of his enemies’ demise. The latter is a frequent theme in the book of Psalms.
The rest of the chapter concentrates on the names and exploits of David’s choice warriors, returning as it were to the end of Chap. 21. Some of the passages are difficult to interpret, but the intent is apparently to celebrate David as warrior king. The whole section would logically fit much earlier in the book, but it has probably been placed here because these final chapters of Samuel function to collect various traditions about David which are best served in isolation from the main narrative flow. They also have the effect of recovering some of David’s earlier heroic stature: he is a selfless military leader who refuses to profit from his soldiers’ fanatical loyalty (vv.13–17), and he heads a formidable group of warriors (vv.18–38) who are, significantly, remembered by name."

Plague and Purchase: The final chapter of Samuel begins on a puzzling note. We are not told why YHWH is angry at Israel, but David becomes an unwitting accomplice in a new sin, that of taking a census. What precisely is wrong with this act is not made explicit. Guesses range from some kind of ancient reluctance to count, at least outside of a religious context (see Exod. 30, where the counted Israelites must be monetarily “redeemed”), to a feeling that taking a military census shows a lack of trust in God. Already in ancient times interpreters were uncomfortable with the passage, and in the later book of Chronicles (I 21), the idea of the census is portrayed as stemming not from God but from a shadowy figure called “the satan,” whose literal meaning is “adversary” (and not the Devil figure of later times).
Be that as it may, by the midpoint of the chapter, it appears that the whole episode is functioning as an opportunity for David to exercise renewed leadership. First he gets to choose the form of punishment that Israel must undergo, and then he alone accepts blame for the plague, imploring God to have compassion on Israel. In that sense, both David and the very concept of kingship are at least partially redeemed as the book of Samuel draws to a close.
There is, however, a further reason for the existence of this narrative. In order to properly atone for the taking of a census, David is to purchase some property up the hill from his palace, so that he may build an altar. The location is none other than the future site of the Temple, which David had been desperate to build in Chap. 7 and which will be erected by his son Shelomo. The book of Samuel thus concludes on a note that looks forward to the establishing of a permanent dynasty, with its presence firmly anchored in the royal complex of Jerusalem, and draws attention away from David’s decline, which had been the narrative focus since Chap. 13. The indignities of his old age are left for the next two chapters, at the beginning of the book of Kings.

So-now, know and take-note: what kind of word shall I answer to the one sending me?"
Ii Samuel 37:14,"David said to Gad:
I am in exceedingly great distress;
now let us fall into Y<small>HWH</small>’s hand,
for great is his compassion;
but into human hands may I never fall!"
Ii Samuel 37:15,"So Y<small>HWH</small> gave forth a plague among Israel, from morning until the appointed-time,
and there died of the people, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,
seventy thousand men."
Ii Samuel 37:16,"But when the [divine] messenger stretched forth his hand against Jerusalem, to bring-it-to-ruin,
Y<small>HWH</small> relented concerning the evil,
and he said to the messenger, the one bringing-ruin among the people:
Enough now, slacken your hand!
Now Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was beside the threshing-floor of Aravna the Yevusite."
Ii Samuel 37:17,"And David said to Y<small>HWH</small>, when he saw the messenger, the one striking down the people,
he said:
Here, it is I who have sinned,
it is I who have done-iniquity,
but these sheep, what have they done?
Pray let your hand be against me and against my Father’s House!"
Ii Samuel 37:18,"Gad came to David on that day
and said to him:
Go up, erect an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>
at the threshing-floor of Aravna the Yevusite."
Ii Samuel 37:19,"So David went up, according to the word of Gad, as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him."
Ii Samuel 37:20,"And Aravna looked out
and saw the king and his servants crossing over to him;
Aravna went out and bowed low to the king, his nostrils to the ground,"
Ii Samuel 37:21,"and Aravna said:
For-what-reason does my lord come to his servant?
David said:
To acquire the threshing-floor from you, to build an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>,
so that the plague may be restrained from upon the people!"
Ii Samuel 37:22,"Aravna said to David:
May my lord king take and offer up whatever is good in his eyes!
See, an ox is for the offering-up
and the sledges and the gear of the oxen are for wood;"
Ii Samuel 37:23,"all [this] does Aravna give, O king, to the king!
And Aravna said to the king:
May Y<small>HWH</small> your God show-you-good-will!"
Ii Samuel 37:24,"The king said to Aravna:
No,
rather I will acquire, acquire it from you at fair-price;
I will not offer up to Y<small>HWH</small> my God offerings-up [obtained] for nothing!
So David acquired the threshing-floor and the ox for silver, fifty weights,"
Ii Samuel 37:25,"and David built there an altar to Y<small>HWH</small>;
he offered up offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings.
And Y<small>HWH</small> let-himself-be-entreated for the land,
so that the plague was restrained from upon Israel.

Ii Samuel 37:26,"<b>sons of Yashen, Yehonatan:</b> The syntax is garbled and difficult to untangle.
24:5 <b>Aro’er:</b> A town east of the Jordan, that sits on the border of the territory of Heshbon."
Ii Samuel 37:27,<b>visionary:</b> Another word for seer or prophet.
Ii Samuel 37:28,"<b>hold three [things] over you:</b> That is, give you a choice of three different punishments."
Ii Samuel 37:29,"<b>never fall:</b> LXX continues, “So David chose the plague …” The use of “falling” contrasts with the “fall” of Sha’ul at the end of I Samuel."
Ii Samuel 37:30,"<b>threshing-floor:</b> A common feature of biblical life, a threshing floor was used to process grain. It would typically be located on a flat, hard outdoor surface, where the grain would be broken down by heavy weights such as stone rollers or even oxen. The site in the present story lay higher than David’s palace at the top of Mount Zion, and eventually became the location of Solomon’s Temple. It appears to be identical to the site of the Dome of the Rock, the Muslim monument that has stood atop the Temple Mount for more than thirteen centuries. <b>Aravna:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-RAHV-nah;</i> trad. English “Araunah.” The name is spelled several ways in biblical passages; the confusion stems, according to some, from the fact that it may not be a name at all but a title, meaning “lord” in Hurrian, an ancient Near Eastern language. Aravna has also been thought to have been a priest, further indicating that the Temple Mount may have been a long-standing holy site."
Ii Samuel 37:31,"<b>all [this] does Aravna give, O king:</b> The phrase could also be read as “all [this] does Aravna the king give to the king,” identifying the former as a person of royal blood."
Ii Samuel 37:32,<b>he offered up offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings:</b> Foreshadowing the future role of the Jerusalem Temple—obtaining God’s forgiveness and turning away his anger. <b>Y<small>HWH</small> let-himself-be-entreated:</b> Echoing the end of Chap. 21 and thus providing a nice bracket for the final section of Samuel (Alter 1999).
