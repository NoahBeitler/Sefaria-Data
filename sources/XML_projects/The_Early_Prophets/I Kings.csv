I Kings 1:1,"Now King David was old, advanced in days,
and they covered him with garments, but he could not get warm."
I Kings 1:2,"So his servants said to him:
Let them seek for my lord king a nubile girl,
that she may stand [in waiting] before the king
and be a caregiver for him;
she will lie in your bosom, and my lord king will be warm."
I Kings 1:3,"So they sought out a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel,
and they found Avishag the Shunammite
and brought her to the king."
I Kings 1:4,"Now the girl was beautiful, exceedingly so;
she became a caregiver for the king, and attended him,
but the king did not know her."
I Kings 1:5,"Meanwhile, Adoniyya son of Haggit was exalting himself, saying:
<i>I</i> will be king!
And he provided himself with chariotry and steeds,
with fifty men running ahead of him."
I Kings 1:6,"Now his father had never scolded him in [all] his days, saying:
For-what-reason did you do thus?
And he was also exceedingly goodly in form;
it was he to whom she gave birth after Avshalom."
I Kings 1:7,"Now his [private] words were with Yoav son of Tzeruya, and with Evyatar the priest;
they provided help [to follow] after Adoniyya,"
I Kings 1:8,"while Tzadok the priest and Benayahu son of Yehoyada and Natan
the prophet and Shim’i and Re’i and the mighty-men who
belonged to David
were not with Adoniyyahu."
I Kings 1:9,"And Adoniyyahu sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings
beside Even Ha-Zohelet/The Serpent Stone that is near En-Rogel,
and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons,
and all the men of Judah, the king’s court-servants,"
I Kings 1:10,but Natan the prophet and Benayahu and the mighty-men and Shelomo his brother he did not invite.
I Kings 1:11,"So Natan said to Bat-Sheva mother of Shelomo, saying:
Have you not heard that Adoniyyahu son of Haggit has become king,
while our lord David does not know?"
I Kings 1:12,"So-now,
go, pray let me advise you with some advice:
save your life and the life of your son Shelomo!"
I Kings 1:13,"Come, go to King David and say to him:
Did not you yourself, my lord king, swear to your handmaid, saying:
Indeed, Shelomo your son will reign as king after me,
<i>he</i> will sit on my throne?
So for-what-reason has Adoniyyahu become king?"
I Kings 1:14,"Here,
[while] you are still speaking there with the king,
I myself will come in after you
and will confirm your words."
I Kings 1:15,"So Bat-Sheva came to the king, into the [inner] room
—now the king was exceedingly old, and Avishag the Shunammite was attending the king—"
I Kings 1:16,"and Bat-Sheva prostrated herself, and bowed low to the king,
and the king said: What is your [business]?"
I Kings 1:17,"She said to him:
My lord, you yourself swore by Y<small>HWH</small> your God to your handmaid:
indeed, Shelomo your son will reign as king after me,
<i>he</i> will sit on my throne!"
I Kings 1:18,"But now,
here, Adoniyyahu has become king,
yet you, my lord king, you do not know!"
I Kings 1:19,"He sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
and invited all the king’s sons, and Evyatar the priest,
and Yoav Commander of the Armed-Forces,
but Shelomo your servant he did not invite."
I Kings 1:20,"As for you, my lord king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you,
to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord king after him!"
I Kings 1:21,"Else it will be,
when my lord king lies beside his fathers,
that I and my son Shelomo will be guilty ones!"
I Kings 1:22,"Now here, while she was still speaking with the king,
Natan the prophet came,"
I Kings 1:23,"and they told the king, saying:
Here is Natan the prophet!
He came before the king and bowed low to the king, on his nostrils to the earth,"
I Kings 1:24,"and Natan said: My lord king,
<i>you</i> must have said: Adoniyyahu will reign as king after me,
<i>he</i> will sit on my throne!—"
I Kings 1:25,"for he went down today
and sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
and invited all the king’s sons and army commanders and Evyatar the priest—
now here, they are eating and drinking before him,
and they said: May King Adoniyyahu live!"
I Kings 1:26,"But as for me, myself your servant
and Tzadok the priest and Benayahu son of Yehoyada and Shelomo your servant he did not invite."
I Kings 1:27,"Is it from my lord king that this matter has come,
while you have not made known to your servant
who will sit on my lord’s throne after him?"
I Kings 1:28,"King David answered and said:
Call Bat-Sheva to me!
She came before the king and stood before the king,"
I Kings 1:29,"and the king swore and said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, who has redeemed my life from every trouble:"
I Kings 1:30,"indeed, as I swore to you by Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, saying:
indeed, Shelomo your son will be king after me,
<i>he</i> will sit on my throne in my place—
indeed, thus will I do this very day!"
I Kings 1:31,"And Bat-Sheva prostrated herself, nostrils to the earth, and bowed low to the king,
and said:
May my lord King David live, forever!"
I Kings 1:32,"King David said:
Call to me Tzadok the priest and Natan the prophet and Benayahu son of Yehoyada!
They came before the king."
I Kings 1:33,"And the king said to them:
Take your lord’s servants with you
and have Shelomo my son mount the mule that belongs to me,
and bring him down to the Gihon;"
I Kings 1:34,"Tzadok the priest is to anoint him there, along with Natan the prophet,
as king over Israel.
Then you are to sound-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>
and are to say: May King Shelomo live!"
I Kings 1:35,"You are to go up after him,
and he is to come in and sit on my throne;
<i>he</i> will be king in my place,
<i>him</i> I have charged to be <i>Nagid</i> over Israel and over Judah!"
I Kings 1:36,"And Benayahu son of Yehoyada answered the king and said: Amen!
So may Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of my lord king, declare!"
I Kings 1:37,"As Y<small>HWH</small> has been with my lord king,
so may he be with Shelomo,
and he may make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!"
I Kings 1:38,"So he went down, Tzadok the priest, with Natan the prophet and Benayahu son of Yehoyada,
and the Kereitites and the Peleitites;
they had Shelomo mount the mule of King David
and brought him to the Gihon."
I Kings 1:39,"Then Tzadok the priest took a horn of oil from the Tent
and anointed Shelomo,
and they sounded-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>;
and all the people said:
May King Shelomo live!"
I Kings 1:40,"And all the people went up after him;
the people were piping on pipes and rejoicing with great joy,
so that the earth split at their sound.

I Kings 2:13,<b>confirm:</b> Or literally “fill in” (Alter 1999).
I Kings 2:14,"<b>What is your [business]?:</b> The Heb. <i>ma-lakh</i> may be a pun on <i>malokh</i>, “reign as king” (Walsh)."
I Kings 2:15,"Y<small>HWH</small>: As explained above in “On Using This Book,” the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, whose pronunciation is not precisely known, is traditionally transcribed as “the Lord” and the like. Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it (for example, “The Eternal,” <i>“Adonai”</i>)."

Settling Scores, Securing the Throne: For a brief moment—the first part of this chapter—the old David returns, although he is not the hero and Psalmist beloved by tradition or the chastened monarch with which the book of Samuel ended. It is the canny and ruthless politician who makes his appearance here. His opening words to his son (vv.2–4) use classic Deuteronomistic language (“be strong,” “keep the keeping of YHWH,” “the teaching,” “prosper,” “with all their heart/being”), and are seen by many as a passage inserted later to soften what follows. For David proceeds to use the word “know,” which appeared in Chap. 1, as a prelude to political assassination. Even Yoav, David’s trusted but violent commander in chief, is not to be spared, for the new king must settle scores and begin afresh. That this advice and behavior sound like those of a Mafia don should not surprise us, given the violent period in which they are set and the literature, succeeding the books of Judges and Samuel, in which they appear. In the end, in contrast to his victims, David simply “lay beside his fathers” (v.10)—but this description is rather pale compared to the deaths of patriarchs (Avraham) and prophets (Moshe), figures with whom one might expect David to be grouped. There is, notably, no public mourning mentioned; thus ends the life of Israel’s greatest king and the measuring rod for all the Judean kings to come. In essence, the cheering we witnessed in I Sam. 18:7 has stopped. The only truly positive note in this chapter is that the dynasty will continue.
David’s successor Shelomo now sheds his passive image from Chap. 1 and emerges as a powerful force on his own. His brother Adoniyyahu, who had expected to be king and had been acting accordingly, finds himself at a disadvantage, but instead of cleverly countering the palace intrigue, he walks into a trap of his own making. In a move reminiscent of a previous usurper, Avshalom, he seeks to sleep with a royal concubine, a move which in the Bible is less of purely sexual import and more an indication that a son seeks to replace his father in power.
In the subsequent action, Bat-Sheva once again appears, and, as Walsh notes, we may wonder about her motivations in interceding for Adoniyyahu. Is she trying to bring about reconciliation between the brothers, or is she, like the audience, fully aware of how Shelomo will react to his brother’s request?
Shelomo’s rule is “firmly-established” at both the beginning (v.12) and end (v.46) of this sequence, but it is disturbing that in the middle, such extreme violence has to take place. Like the stereotyped violence of assassination in Samuel (four uses of the rare word “abdomen” to specify where the victims are stabbed), the murders here are described by means of a single verb, “attack.” Another key word provides one answer to the troubling question of whether the killing is justified: the bloodguilt and other crimes of Yoav and Shim’i “<i>return</i> [on their heads]” (vv.33 and 44; italics mine). And Adoniyyahu’s death as well is a kind of payback for his acts of usurpation. So by the end of the chapter all the loose ends have been tied up, albeit that the new king, whose name suggests “peace,” has achieved it through the usual and not very peaceful methods practiced by kings.
A nonviolent resolution of conflicts does occur in vv.26–27, where the last of the line of Eli the priest (see the opening chapters of Samuel) is relieved of a future priestly role. Thus the text has God’s word in history fulfilled, beginning a major pattern in the book of Kings."
I Kings 2:25,"Adoniyyahu heard it, and all those invited who were with him
—now they had just finished eating—
and [when] Yoav heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i>,
he said:
For-what-reason is the sound of the city [one of] panic?"
I Kings 2:26,"He was still speaking,
when here: Yonatan son of Evyatar the priest came.
Adoniyyahu said: Come in!
For you are a man of valor,
and you bring good news."
I Kings 2:27,"Yonatan spoke up and said to Adoniyyahu:
But—our lord King David has made Shelomo king!"
I Kings 2:28,"The king sent with him Tzadok the priest and Natan the prophet and Benayahu son of Yehoyada,
and the Kereitites and the Peleitites,
and they had him mount the king’s mule,"
I Kings 2:29,"and Tzadok the priest and Natan the prophet anointed him as king at the Gihon;
they went up from there rejoicing,
and the city was [as in a] panic!
That is the sound that you heard."
I Kings 2:30,"And even more, Shelomo is seated on the throne of the kingdom,"
I Kings 2:31,"and even more, the king’s servants have come to bless our lord King David, saying:
May your God make Shelomo’s name better than your name,
may he make his throne greater than your throne!
And the king bowed low on the couch."
I Kings 2:32,"And even more, thus did the king say:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
who has given [one] today to sit on my throne, and my eyes see it!"
I Kings 2:33,"Then they trembled and arose, all those invited who were for Adoniyyahu,
and each one went on his way."
I Kings 2:34,"And Adoniyyahu was in fear before Shelomo,
so he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the sacrificialaltar."
I Kings 2:35,"And it was told to Shelomo, saying:
Here, Adoniyyahu is in fear of King Shelomo,
and here, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying:
Let King Shelomo swear to me this [very] day that he will not put his servant to death by the sword!"
I Kings 2:36,"So Shelomo said:
If he behaves like a valiant one,
not a hair of his will fall to the ground;
but if any evil be found in him, then he shall die!"
I Kings 2:37,"King Shelomo sent, and they brought him down from the altar;
he came and bowed low to King Shelomo,
and Shelomo said to him:
Go back to your house!"
I Kings 3:1,"Now David’s days drew near to die,
so he charged Shelomo his son, saying:"
I Kings 3:2,"I am about to go the way of all the earth.
You are to be strong, and be a man!"
I Kings 3:3,"You are to keep the keeping of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
walking in his ways, keeping his laws, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies,
as it is written in the Instruction of Moshe,
in order that you may cause to prosper all that you do
and wherever you face,"
I Kings 3:4,"in order that Y<small>HWH</small> may fulfill his word that he spoke to me, saying:
If your sons will guard their way,
walking in my presence in truth,
with all their heart and with all their being,
no one will [ever] be cut off from you from the throne of Israel."
I Kings 3:5,"Now even more, you yourself know what Yoav son of Tzeruya did to me,
what he did to the two commanders of the armed-forces of Israel,
to Avner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Yeter—he killed them,
and he brought the blood of war into peacetime:
he put the blood of war on his belt that is on his loins and on his sandal that is on his feet."
I Kings 3:6,"So you are to act according to your worldly-wisdom:
you must not let his gray-hair go down in peace to Sheol!"
I Kings 3:7,"But to the sons of Barzillai the Gil’adite you are to show loyalty;
they should be among those eating at your table,
for thus they came near to me [in friendship] when I ran away from Avshalom your brother."
I Kings 3:8,"And here, with you is Shim’i son of Gera, the Binyaminite from Bahurim:
<i>he</i> cursed me with a grievous curse on the day of my going to Mahanayim.
But when <i>he</i> went down to meet me at the Jordan,
I swore to him by Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
If I should put you to death by the sword … !"
I Kings 3:9,"But now, do not hold him clear,
for you are a worldly-wise man:
you know what you must do to him,
so that you bring down his gray-hair in blood to Sheol!"
I Kings 3:10,"And David lay beside his fathers,
and was buried in the City of David."
I Kings 3:11,"Now the days that David reigned as king over Israel were forty years:
in Hevron he reigned as king for seven years, while in Jerusalem he reigned as king for thirty-three years."
I Kings 3:12,"And Shelomo sat on the throne of David his father,
and his kingdom was exceedingly firmly-established."
I Kings 3:13,"Adoniyyahu son of Haggit came to Bat-Sheva mother of Shelomo.
She said:
Is your coming in peace?
He said:
In peace."
I Kings 3:14,"And he said:
I have a word for you.
She said: Speak!"
I Kings 3:15,"He said:
You yourself know that mine was the kingdom,
and that toward me all Israel had set their faces to be king.
But the kingdom has been reversed and has become my brother’s,
since it was from Y<small>HWH</small> that it became his."
I Kings 3:16,"So-now,
there is one request that I request of you—
do not turn away my face!
She said to him: Speak!"
I Kings 3:17,"He said:
Pray talk to Shelomo the king
—for he will not turn away your face—
that he may give me Avishag the Shunammite as a wife."
I Kings 3:18,"Bat-Sheva said: Very well,
I myself will speak regarding you to the king."
I Kings 3:19,"So Bat-Sheva came to King Shelomo, to speak to him regarding Adoniyyahu.
And the king arose to meet her, and bowed low to her;
then he sat down on his throne,
and he prepared a throne for the king’s mother, and she sat down at his right."
I Kings 3:20,"She said:
There is one small request that I request of you;
do not turn away my face.
The king said to her:
Make request, mother,
for I will not turn away your face."
I Kings 3:21,"She said:
Let Avishag the Shunammite be given to Adoniyyahu your brother as a wife."
I Kings 3:22,"King Shelomo answered and said to his mother:
Now why are you requesting Avishag the Shunammite for Adoniyyahu?
Request the kingdom [itself] for him,
for he is my brother, the one older than I!
—for him and for Evyatar the priest and for Yoav son of Tzeruya!"
I Kings 3:23,"And King Shelomo swore by Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add:
indeed, at [the cost of] his life has Adoniyyahu spoken this word!"
I Kings 3:24,"So-now, Y<small>HWH</small>, who has established-me-firmly and seated me on the throne of David my father,
and who has made me a [dynastic] house, as he promised:
indeed, today Adoniyyahu will be put to death!"
I Kings 3:25,"So King Shelomo sent by the hand of Benayahu son of Yehoyada;
he attacked him, so that he died."
I Kings 3:26,"Now to Evyatar the priest, the king said:
To Anatot, go to your fields!
For you are a man [deserving] of death,
but on this day I will not put you to death,
since you carried the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> before my father David,
and since you suffered all that my father suffered."
I Kings 3:27,"So Shelomo drove out Evyatar from being priest to Y<small>HWH</small>,
so as to fulfill the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had spoken regarding the House of Eli at Shilo."
I Kings 3:28,"Now the report came to Yoav
—since Yoav had inclined after Adoniyya, though after Avshalom he had not inclined—
and Yoav fled to the Tent of Y<small>HWH</small> and took hold of the horns of the altar."
I Kings 3:29,"King Shelomo was told that Yoav had fled to the Tent of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and here: he was next to the altar,
so Shelomo sent Benayahu son of Yehoyada, saying:
Go, attack him!"
I Kings 3:30,"Benayahu came to the Tent of Y<small>HWH</small>
and said to him:
Thus says the king:
Come out!
He said:
No, for here I will die!
Benayahu returned word to the king, saying:
Thus spoke Yoav, and thus he answered me."
I Kings 3:31,"The king said to him:
Do as he spoke—
attack him and then bury him,
so that you may remove the causeless blood that Yoav shed
from me and from my Father’s House."
I Kings 3:32,"May Y<small>HWH</small> return his blood on his head—
[seeing] that he attacked two men more righteous and noble than he, and killed them with the sword,
while my father David did not know:
Avner son of Ner, Commander of the Armed-Forces of Israel,
and Amasa son of Yeter, Commander of the Armed-Forces of Judah."
I Kings 3:33,"Their bloodguilt will return on the head of Yoav and on the head of his seed, into the ages,
while for David, and for his seed, and for his house, and for his throne, there will be peace for the ages from Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Kings 3:34,"So Benayahu son of Yehoyada went up and attacked him, and put him to death;
he was buried in his house in the wilderness."
I Kings 3:35,"And the king put Benayahu son of Yehoyada in his place as [The One] Over the Armed-Forces,
while Tzadok the priest, the king put in place of Evyatar."
I Kings 3:36,"Then the king sent and summoned Shim’i
and said to him:
Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and stay there;
you are not to go out of there, [either] here or there."
I Kings 3:37,"For it will be, on the day of your going out and crossing Wadi Kidron:
know, yes, know that you will die, yes, die—
your blood will be on your [own] head!"
I Kings 3:38,"Shim’i said to the king:
The word is good;
as my lord king has spoken, thus will your servant do.
And Shim’i stayed in Jerusalem for many days."
I Kings 3:39,"But it was at the end of three years
that two of Shim’i’s servants ran off to Akhish son of Maakha, king of Gat,
and they told Shim’i, saying:
Here, your servants are at Gat!"
I Kings 3:40,"So Shim’i arose and saddled his donkey and went to Gat, to Akhish,
to seek his servants.
And Shim’i went and brought back his servants from Gat."
I Kings 3:41,"Shelomo was told that Shim’i had gone from Jerusalem to Gat, and had returned,"
I Kings 3:42,"so the king sent and called for Shim’i;
he said to him:
Did I not have you swear by Y<small>HWH</small>
—and I warned you—saying:
On the day of your going out, if you should go [either] here or there,
know, yes, know that you will die, yes, die!?
And you said to me:
The word is good—I hearken."
I Kings 3:43,"So why did you not keep the sworn-oath of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and the command that I commanded you?"
I Kings 3:44,"And the king said to Shim’i:
<i>You</i> know all the evildoing that your heart knew,
that you did to David my father.

I Kings 4:16,"<b>attacked:</b> The verb (Heb. <i>p-g-’</i>) is used four times in this chapter (parallel perhaps to the four occasions in Samuel when David’s enemies are stabbed in the abdomen).

I Kings 4:28,"<b><i>You</i> know all the evildoing that your heart knew:</b> This odd phraseology calls upon Shim’i to remember the past; his previous “evildoing” to David will now bring down the ultimate evil (or “disaster”) upon himself. <b>heart:</b> In the Hebrew Bible, it is often close to our concept of “mind.”
Shelomo the Wise: The bulk of this chapter deals with Shelomo’s acquisition of wisdom—the practical wisdom needed to govern—and a memorable demonstration of this quality (vv. 16–28). Yet these accounts are preceded by three verses of a Deuteronomistic kind, in which two discordant themes are introduced: marriage to a foreigner (in this case, the Egyptian king’s daughter) and Israel’s continuing use of local sanctuaries. Since at the end of Shelomo’s reign the worship of foreign gods and use of these local holy places are held to be responsible for the kingdom’s permanent split, this chapter, which also introduces some of the glories of the king’s rule, could be understood as yet another example of the Bible’s complex feelings about kingship.
Similarly, the site of the story produces complex reactions. Giv’on, according to I Chron. 16:39 and 21:29, housed the altar and Tent used in Israelite worship, and so is appropriate for a scene of sacrifice. But it is also associated with two tales of violence in Samuel: the military contest between Yoav’s and Avner’s troops in II 2 and the killing of Sha’ul’s remaining descendants in II 21 as revenge for his massacre of the Giv’onites. So it may reflect the dual image of Shelomo and his kingship that is presented in the book.
The dream sequence in vv.5–14 draws on well-established traditions in ancient lore: dreams as revelations of the divine and the folklore motif of the supernatural offering to grant a mortal’s wish. As usual, the offer functions as a kind of test, and in this case the hero passes it with flying colors. Seven times we hear the word “request,” which not only makes sense in context, but also harks back to the story of Israel’s clamoring for a king in I Sam. 8. The general vocabulary of the dialogue between God and Shelomo lays out the idealized role of the monarch: he should be a man of “understanding,” “wisdom,” and “discernment,” with “justice” as the ultimate goal.
The story of the two prostitutes and the contested baby follows immediately, a deeply human tale set amid a celebratory feast. It has become famous in Western art; the combination of a presumably opulent setting, the contrasting emotions of the two women, a baby (typically portrayed by artists as naked), and a fearsome sword have proven irresistible. That the women are prostitutes should not be surprising. In the ancient Near East, it was understood that ordinary folk should have access to the throne to air their grievances, and so the tale is the perfeet test case for Shelomo’s ability to govern his entire people wisely. He emerges as an astute assessor of human behavior, a ruler with “an understanding heart” (v.9) who, despite his inexperience, is now able “to discern between good and evil” (v.9) in people’s actions and motivations. The story is also our first encounter in Kings with anonymous women, who will play a major role in the book by throwing issues of power and character into sharp relief."
I Kings 5:1,"Shelomo became the son-in-law of Pharaoh of Egypt:
he took Pharaoh’s daughter [in marriage], and brought her to the City of David,
until he had finished building his house, and the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, and the wall of Jerusalem, all around."
I Kings 5:2,"However, the people were sacrificing at the sanctuaries,
since no house had been built for the name of Y<small>HWH</small> up until those days."
I Kings 5:3,"And Shelomo loved Y<small>HWH</small>,
walking in the practices of David his father;
however, at the sanctuaries he was offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke."
I Kings 5:4,"And the king went to Giv’on, to sacrifice there,
for it was the great sanctuary;
a thousand offerings-up would Shelomo offer up on that altar."
I Kings 5:5,"At Giv’on, Y<small>HWH</small> appeared to Shelomo in a dream of the night.
God said:
Make request: What shall I give you?"
I Kings 5:6,"Shelomo said:
You yourself have shown great loyalty to your servant, David my father,
as he walked before you in truth and in equity and in rightness of heart beside you,
and you have kept this great loyalty toward him, by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as is this day."
I Kings 5:7,"So-now, Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
you yourself have made your servant king in place of David my father,
but I am a young lad—
I do not know how to go out and to come in!"
I Kings 5:8,"And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen,
a people so many that it cannot be measured and cannot be numbered in abundance."
I Kings 5:9,"So give your servant an understanding heart
to judge your people, to discern between good and evil.
For who is able to judge this your weighty people?"
I Kings 5:10,"The word was good in the eyes of the Lord,
that Shelomo had requested this thing;"
I Kings 5:11,"God said to him:
Because you requested this thing
and did not request for yourself many days
and did not request for yourself riches
and did not request the life of your enemies,
but requested for yourself discernment to understand justice,"
I Kings 5:12,"here, I have done according to your words—
here, I am giving you a wise and discerning heart,
such that like you, none has been before you
and after you, none will arise like you."
I Kings 5:13,"And even what you did not request, I give you:
even riches, even honor,
such as none has been like you, as a man among kings, for all your days."
I Kings 5:14,"And if you walk in my ways, keeping my laws and my commandments,
as David your father walked,
I will prolong your days."
I Kings 5:15,"Shelomo awoke, and here: [It was] a dream!
He came to Jerusalem and stood before the Coffer of the Lord’s Covenant
and offered up offerings-up, and performed shalom-offerings,
and made a drinkfest for all his servants."
I Kings 5:16,"Then two whore women came to the king
and stood before him."
I Kings 5:17,"The one woman said:
Please, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house,
and I gave birth alongside her in the house."
I Kings 5:18,"And it was, on the third day after my giving birth,
that also this woman gave birth
—now we were together, there was no outsider with us in the house,
only the two of us in the house."
I Kings 5:19,"And this woman’s son died at night,
[seeing] that she had lain upon him,"
I Kings 5:20,"so she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from next to me
while your handmaid was sleeping,
and laid him in her bosom,
while her son, the dead one, she laid in my bosom."
I Kings 5:21,"I arose at daybreak to nurse my son,
and here: he was dead!
But when I examined him at daybreak,
now here, he was not my son whom I had borne!"
I Kings 5:22,"The other woman said:
No—indeed,
my son is the living one, and your son is the dead one!
And this one was saying:
No—indeed,
your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one!
Thus they spoke before the king.

I Kings 6:1,"<b>Pharaoh:</b> As usual, we are not told which king of Egypt is meant here. <b>the City of David:</b> Referring to the area south of the present Old City; Shelomo expanded the royal precinct northward, with the Temple atop what the ancients called Mount Zion (today’s Temple Mount). <b>his house:</b> The Hebrew word used for both “palace” and “Temple” are the same (<i>bayit</i>) in these texts. Note which of the two is mentioned first here—a possible suggestion as to their relative importance in Shelomo’s eyes."
I Kings 6:2,"<b>the sanctuaries:</b> Traditionally rendered “high places,” this is a technical term for shrines outside of Jerusalem (a more focused translation might be “platform shrines” or, according to some, “open-air sanctuaries”). Given the strong slant of the book toward centralized worship in Jerusalem, every king who tolerates or sacrifices at them is to some extent condemned. <b>for the name of</b> Y<small>HWH</small>: In Deut. 1 and I Kings 8, in contrast to earlier literature, the Temple becomes the residence of God’s “name” rather than of the deity himself."

I Kings 6:7,"<b>an understanding heart:</b> Lit., “a listening heart.” As with the term “wisdom,” here the point is not merely intellectual capacity but the practical ability to make wise decisions and administer justice."
I Kings 6:8,"<b>requested:</b> The verb pointed to a major theme in the Sha’ul (“The Requested One”) story; here, it comes from the king himself and is obviously viewed favorably, since it occurs five times in v.11 alone."
I Kings 6:9,"<b><i>shalom</i>-offerings:</b> A type of sacrifice that creates reconciliation and solidarity within the community. JPS and others use “offerings of well-being.”
Shelomo’s Bureaucracy: This short chapter mirrors II Sam. 8:15–18, which enumerated the officials of King David’s court. While it is impossible to verify the names historically (and, as Walsh says, they may be here simply to give the narrative a plausible flavor), the text does present both rulers as presiding over a developed bureaucracy, and thus suggests at least the beginnings of a centralized state. As we have noted above, the tensions that normally grow out of such a transition from a tribal to a cosmopolitan society are reflected throughout Samuel and Kings. In both this and the Samuel passage, “all Israel” is stressed, although the mention of “Judah and Israel” at the end here (v.20) does not allow us to forget that the strong identity of the two separate regions was the prevailing reality throughout most of Israelite history."
I Kings 6:10,"The king said:
This one says: This is my son, the living one, and your son is the dead one;
while this one says: No—indeed,
your son is the dead one, and mine is the living one!"
I Kings 6:11,"So the king said:
Fetch me a sword!
And they brought a sword before the king."
I Kings 6:12,"And the king said:
Cut the living child in two
and give half to the one and half to the [other] one!"
I Kings 6:13,"Then said the woman whose son was the living one to the king
—for her insides burned for her son—
she said:
Please, my lord, give her the living newborn,
but death, don’t put him to death!
But this one was saying:
Not mine and not yours will he be;

I Kings 6:14,"The king spoke up and said:
Give her the living newborn;
but death, do not put him to death—
she is his mother!"

Shelomo’s Wealth, Wisdom, and Fame; Preparations for Building the Temple: The splendor of Shelomo’s court now unfolds. The chapter is awash with details about the extent of the king’s territory, his provisions for a single day, and his horses, interspersed with a note of peace and security such as we rarely hear in this part of the Bible. Vv.9–14 describe Shelomo’s wisdom in glowing terms, so that in this account he surpasses other ancient sages and is universally admired.
From the sevenfold sounding of the root “wise/wisdom,” which in its appearance above meant the ability to govern well, the text moves toward the central aspect of Shelomo’s reign, the building of the Temple, which must also be done with wisdom of the practical kind—that is, with skill and craftsmanship. For the initial stages, the king contacts his father’s old northern ally, Hiram of Tyre, from whom he will procure the needed building materials. But the on-site work will be done by Israelites, who are now impressed into labor gangs. This massive organization of men, which would have been the only possible way to accomplish such a project, well symbolizes the concept of a burgeoning state, with all its attendant disruption, for thousands of men must be drawn from the fields where they normally toil. The text makes no direct complaints here, however. Its primary goal is no doubt to impress the audience."
I Kings 7:6,"Elihoref and Ahiyya sons of Shisha, [royal] Scribes,

they let nothing be wanting."
I Kings 8:8,"And as for the barley and the hay for the horses and for the pack-animals,
they would bring it to the place where he would be,
each one according to his turn."
I Kings 8:9,"And God gave wisdom to Shelomo,
and discernment, exceedingly much,
and breadth of mind
like the sand that is on the shore of the sea,"
I Kings 8:10,"so that much greater was Shelomo’s wisdom than the wisdom of all the Children of the East,
and than the wisdom of Egypt."
I Kings 8:11,"He was wiser than all [other] human beings—

from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom."
I Kings 8:15,"Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Shelomo,
for he had heard that it was he who had been anointed as king in place of his father
—for Hiram had loved David [in covenant] all the days."
I Kings 8:16,"And Shelomo sent word to Hiram, saying:"
I Kings 8:17,"You yourself know [regarding] David my father
that he was not able to build a House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small> his God,
because of the wars that surrounded him,
until Y<small>HWH</small> put them beneath the soles of my feet."
I Kings 8:18,"But now,
Y<small>HWH</small> my God has granted me rest round about;
there is no adversary and no evil circumstance."
I Kings 8:19,"So here, I intend to build a House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
as Y<small>HWH</small> promised to David my father, saying:
Your son whom I will put in your place on your throne,
<i>he</i> will build the House for my name!"
I Kings 8:20,"So-now,
command that they cut down cedars for me from the Levanon;
my servants will be beside your servants,
and your servants’ wage I will give you, according to whatever you say,
for you yourself know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut down trees like the Sidonians."
I Kings 8:21,"It was, when Hiram heard Shelomo’s words,
that he rejoiced exceedingly;
he said:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small> today,
who has given David a wise son over this numerous people!"
I Kings 8:22,"And Hiram sent to Shelomo, saying:
I have heard [the message] that you sent to me;
I myself will do whatever you desire
regarding cedar trees and regarding juniper trees."
I Kings 8:23,"My servants will bring them down from the Levanon to the Sea,
and <i>I</i> will make them into rafts at the Sea, for any place that you send to me;
then I will break them up there, so that <i>you</i> may carry them away.
As for you, you will do my desire, to give food for my household."
I Kings 8:24,"So Hiram would give Shelomo cedar trees and juniper trees, whatever he desired,"
I Kings 8:25,"while Shelomo gave Hiram twenty thousand <i>cors</i> of wheat as food for his household,

Building the Temple I: The first chapter on the construction of the Temple concentrates initially on its outer dimensions and ends with a description of the walls and sacred “Rear-Chamber,” along with their decorations. In between (vv.11–13) has been inserted a Deuteronomistic pledge by God that, contingent on Israel keeping the stipulations of the covenant, he will maintain his presence among the Israelites and not abandon them. The Bible understands this as a key goal of the Temple, which mimics the role of the Tabernacle (“Dwelling”) in the presettlement period, as described especially in Exodus.
A more detailed description of the inner furnishings of the Temple has been left to the next chapter."
I Kings 9:1,"Now it was in year four hundred and eighty of the years of the Children of Israel’s going out from the land of Egypt,
in the fourth year—in the month of Ziv, that is the second month—of Shelomo’s reign as king over Israel,
that he [began] building the House to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 9:2,"And the House that King Shelomo built for Y<small>HWH</small> was:
sixty cubits its length, twenty its width, and thirty cubits its height."
I Kings 9:3,"As for the portico at the front of the Great-Hall of the House:
twenty cubits was its length, along the width of the House,
and ten by the cubit its depth, in front of the House."
I Kings 9:4,"And he made windows for the House, framed [and] latticed,"
I Kings 9:5,"and he built an extension against the wall of the House, all around,
namely, along the walls of the House,
round about the Great-Hall and the Rear-Chamber,
and he made side-chambers all around."
I Kings 9:6,"The lowest side-chamber was five by the cubit its width,
with the middle one, six by the cubit its width,
and the third one, seven cubits its width,
for he placed offsets for the House, all around, on the exterior,
so as not to fasten [them] to the walls of the House."
I Kings 9:7,"And the House as it was being built,
of complete quarry stone it was built,
and [neither] hammers nor pickax—any tool of iron—
was heard in the House as it was being built."
I Kings 9:8,"The entrance to the lowest side-chamber was on the right shoulder of the House,
while winding-stairs went up to the middle one from the lower one, and from the middle one to the third one."
I Kings 9:9,"So he built the House and finished it:
he covered the House with hollow-squares and beam-projections, of cedar."
I Kings 9:10,"He built the extension along the entire House, five cubits its height,
and secured the House with cedar wood."
I Kings 9:11,"Now the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Shelomo, saying:"
I Kings 9:12,"[Regarding] this House that you are building:
if you walk in my ways, and my practices you observe,
and you keep my commandments, walking in them,
I will fulfill my word with you which I promised to David your father:"
I Kings 9:13,"I will dwell in the midst of the Children of Israel,
and I will not abandon my people Israel!"
I Kings 9:14,So Shelomo built the House and finished it;
I Kings 9:15,"he built the walls of the House on the interior with cedar planks,
from the floor of the House up to the beams of the ceiling;
he overlaid it with wood on the interior,
and overlaid the floor of the House with juniper planks."
I Kings 9:16,"And he built twenty cubits from the flanks of the House with cedar planks,
from the floor up to the beams,
and built it on the interior as a Rear-Chamber, the Holiest Holy-Place."
I Kings 9:17,"Forty by the cubit [long] was the House—
that was the Great-Hall in front [of it]."
I Kings 9:18,"Now the cedarwork of the interior of the House was carving of gourds and open flowers;
all was cedar, no stone was to be seen."
I Kings 9:19,"Now the Rear-Chamber within the House, in the interior, he prepared for placing there the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant."
I Kings 9:20,"And in the forepart of the Rear-Chamber were twenty cubits of length, twenty cubits of width, and twenty cubits its height,
and he overlaid it with refined gold.
And he overlaid the sacrificial-altar with cedar."
I Kings 9:21,"And Shelomo overlaid the House on the interior with refined gold;
he passed chains of gold across the front of the Rear-Chamber
and overlaid it with gold,"
I Kings 9:22,"and the entire House he overlaid with gold, until the entire House was done,
while the entire altar that belonged to the Rear-Chamber he overlaid with gold."
I Kings 9:23,"And in the Rear-Chamber he made two winged-sphinxes of oleaster wood,
ten cubits its height."
I Kings 9:24,"Five cubits was the wing of the one sphinx,
and five cubits was the wing of the second sphinx—
ten cubits from the tips of its wing to the tips of its [other] wing."
I Kings 9:25,"And ten by the cubit was the second sphinx,
a single measure and a single shape for the two winged-sphinxes."
I Kings 9:26,"The height of the one sphinx was ten by the cubit,
and thus for the second sphinx."
I Kings 9:27,"And he placed the winged-sphinxes in the middle of the inner House;
the wings of the sphinxes were spread out

I Kings 10:1,"<b>four hundred and eighty:</b> Interpreters have spent centuries trying to calculate the date of the Exodus from this, but it seems much more likely that this is another ‘’meaningful” biblical number, equaling forty times twelve or four times ten times twelve, and indicating the orderliness of God’s plan for Israel. <b>Ziv:</b> Pronounced <i>zeev</i>, the “Blossom Month,” in the spring.

The Palace; Building the Temple II: Shelomo’s palace, whose construction takes almost twice as long as that of the Temple, includes five structures, most notably the “House of the Forest of Levanon,” an apt metaphor for a stunning, multicolumned structure. From v.13 on, the text returns to the Temple, beginning with an identification of Hiram, the chief craftsman—-just as the account of the Tabernacle (“Dwelling”) in Exodus had identified its own, Betzalel. It proceeds to provide descriptions of architectural features (such as the two great columns in front of the Temple, along with their capitals), ritual appurtenances (for example, the huge basin known as the “Sea,” and the washing-stands for the priests), and the elaborate wall decorations.
As the chapter moves toward the completion of these buildings (vv.40–50), the pace quickens, again resembling the final chapters of Exodus. Significantly, the whole account ends with an emphasis on silver, gold, and vessels—which, as explained in the Introduction to Kings, will be systematically looted at moments throughout the book, culminating in the final despoiling in the last chapter of Kings.

I Kings 10:16,And he overlaid the winged-sphinxes with gold.
I Kings 10:17,"Now all the walls of the House, round about, he carved with engraved carvings of winged-sphinxes and palmettes and open flowers,
on the inside and out."
I Kings 10:18,"And the floor of the House he overlaid with gold,
inside and out."
I Kings 10:19,"Now the entrance to the Rear-Chamber he made as doors of oleaster wood;

I Kings 10:20,"As for the two doors of oleaster wood,
he carved on them carvings of winged-sphinxes, palmettes, and open flowers,
and overlaid them with gold,
and he hammered the gold over the winged-sphinxes and over the palmettes."
I Kings 10:21,"And so [too] he made for the entrance to the Great-Hall: posts of oleaster wood, a fourth [of the wall-length],"

I Kings 11:2,"And he built the House of the Forest of the Levanon:

I Kings 11:3,"And it was covered with cedar from above, atop the planks that were on the columns,
forty-five: fifteen per row."
I Kings 11:4,"And the window-frames were of three rows,
with sight line toward sight line, three times."
I Kings 11:5,"And all the entrances and posts were square of frame, opposite,

I Kings 11:6,"And the Portico of Columns he made: fifty cubits its length
and twenty cubits its width,
with a portico in front of them,
with columns and a cornice in front of them."
I Kings 11:7,"And the Portico of the Throne, where he would pronounce judgment, the Portico of Justice, he made;
it was covered with cedar, from floor to floor."
I Kings 11:8,"And his housing where he would reside, in the other courtyard within the portico,
was like this [same] pattern;
and he was [also] to make a house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Shelomo had taken [in marriage], like this portico."
I Kings 11:9,"All these were of costly stones, hewn according to measure,
smoothed with a smoothing-tool, within and without,

I Kings 11:10,"It was founded [on] costly stones, large stones,
stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits."
I Kings 11:11,"And above were costly stones, hewn to measure, and cedar."

he was filled with practical-wisdom, discernment, and technical-knowledge
to make all kinds of work in bronze.
He came to King Shelomo and made all his work:"
I Kings 11:15,"he fashioned the two columns, of bronze—
eighteen cubits the height of the one column,
with a cord of twelve cubits [able to] go around it, and so the second column."
I Kings 11:16,"And two capitals he made
to put on the tops of the columns, cast in bronze—

I Kings 11:20,"And the capitals on the two columns were also above, close to the bulging-section that was across from the netting,
and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows, all around the second capital."
I Kings 11:21,"He set up the columns for the portico of the Great-Hall:
he set up the right column, and called its name <i>Yakhin</i>/He Establishes,
and he set up the left column, and called its name <i>Boaz/</i> In Him, Strength."
I Kings 11:22,"And on the top of the columns was a pattern of lilies.
Then the work of the columns was done."
I Kings 11:23,"He made the Sea-Basin, cast: ten by the cubit from its lip to its [other] lip, circular, all around,
five cubits its height,

I Kings 11:28,"And this was the pattern of the standwork:
they had enclosures,
and enclosures between the crosspieces—"
I Kings 11:29,"and on the enclosures that were between the crosspieces
were lions, oxen, and sphinxes,
and on the crosspieces were thus;
above and below the lions and the oxen were spirals of hammered making."
I Kings 11:30,"And four wheels of bronze were for each one stand, and axles of bronze,
and its four legs had shoulder-pieces under the basin;
the shoulder-pieces were cast across from each one in spirals."
I Kings 11:31,"And its mouth, within the capital, and above [it] for one cubit,
its mouth was circular, in the pattern of a pedestal,
a cubit and half a cubit,
and even on the mouth there were carvings.
Now their frames were square, not circular."
I Kings 11:32,"And four wheels were beneath the enclosures;
the supports of the wheels were in the stand, with the height of the one wheel a cubit and half a cubit.

Shelomo’s Prayer of Dedication: This long speech, beginning with a statement about Shelomo’s intent to build a Temple and culminating in a remarkable series of prayers, appears to have a complicated textual history. Some of it presupposes exile, while other parts hint at a later return; however, the bulk seems to belong to a time after the destruction of the Northern Kingdom in 722 (Sweeney 2007). Its wordiness is almost ceremonial, reminiscent of II Sam. 7, where God had made dramatic promises to David about his dynasty. And the opening fits well into an ancient Near Eastern pattern: a king solidifies his rule by dedicating or rededicating a temple in the name of the god who put him on the throne.
Beginning with v.31, the chapter enumerates seven cases in which people may petition God in the Temple. They involve mainly internal crises, but also shift, after v.44, to situations outside the land of Israel, such as war and captivity. These do not necessarily put this part of the chapter in a Babylonian Exile setting, although they undoubtedly came to be read that way. All square nicely with the Deuteronomistic view that Israel’s security and prosperity come from keeping the covenant with Y<small>HWH</small>.
As Sweeney (2007) points out, the blessing uttered by Shelomo (vv.54–60) likewise encapsulates Deuteronomistic ideas, including divine promises to the ancestors and emphasis on the covenant, encompassing both Y<small>HWH</small>’s faithfulness and Israel’s need to obey. Indeed, the verb “promise” (literally, “speak”) occurs eight times in the chapter, six in vv. 15–26 and then twice at the end (v.56)."

and the basins, ten, on the stands,"
I Kings 11:66,"and the one Sea,

I Kings 11:67,"and the pots, and the shovels, and the sprinkling-bowls—
all these vessels that Hiram made for King Shelomo, for the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
were of polished bronze."
I Kings 11:68,"In the round-plain of the Jordan the king had cast them, in thick soil,
between Sukkot and Tzaretan."
I Kings 11:69,"And Shelomo left all the vessels [unweighed], out of their exceeding, exceeding abundance;
the weight of the bronze could not be ascertained."
I Kings 11:70,"And Shelomo made all the vessels that were for the House of Y<small>HWH</small>:
the golden sacrificial-altar,
and the table on which was the Bread of the Presence, of gold,"
I Kings 11:71,"and the lampstands, with five to the right and five to the left,
in front of the Rear-Chamber, of refined gold,
and the flowerwork, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,"
I Kings 11:72,"and the bowls, the snuffers, the sprinkling-bowls, the ladles, and the incense-pans, of refined gold,
and the hinge-pieces for the doors to the inner house, the Holiest Holy-Place,
[and] for the doors of the House, for the Great-Hall, of gold."
I Kings 11:73,"And all the work that King Shelomo had made on the House of Y<small>HWH</small> was completed;
Shelomo brought the holy-objects of David his father:
the silver, the gold, and all the [other] vessels,
and he put them in the treasuries of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 12:1,"Then Shelomo assembled the elders of Israel,
all the heads of the tribes, the ancestral leaders of the Children of Israel, to King Shelomo in Jerusalem,
to bring up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH’s</small> Covenant from the City of David—that is Zion."
I Kings 12:2,"And every man of Israel assembled to King Shelomo, in the month of Etanim/Ever-Flowing, at the Festival—that is the seventh month."
I Kings 12:3,"And all the elders of Israel came,
and the priests carried the Coffer;"
I Kings 12:4,"they brought up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> along with the Tent of Appointment and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent;
the priests and the Levites brought them up."
I Kings 12:5,"Meanwhile, King Shelomo and the entire community of Israel who were present with him before the Coffer
were offering-sacrifices of sheep and oxen
which could not be numbered or measured in abundance."
I Kings 12:6,"And the priests brought the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant to its place, to the Rear-Chamber of the House, to the Holiest Holy-Place,
beneath the wings of the sphinxes."
I Kings 12:7,"For the sphinxes were spreading [their] wings to the place of the Coffer,
so that the sphinxes were sheltering the Coffer and its poles from above."
I Kings 12:8,"And the poles were so long that the heads of the poles could be seen from the Holy-Place in front of the Rear-Chamber, but could not be seen outside;
they have been there until this day."
I Kings 12:9,"There is nothing in the Coffer
save the two stone tablets that Moshe had put there at Horev,
when Y<small>HWH</small> had cut [a covenant] with the Children of Israel, at their going out from the land of Egypt."
I Kings 12:10,"And it was, at the priests’ going out from the Holy-Place,
that the cloud filled the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Kings 12:11,"and the priests were not able to stand to attend because of the cloud,
for the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> had filled the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 12:12,"Then Shelomo said:
Y<small>HWH</small> has determined to dwell in thick darkness."
I Kings 12:13,"I have built, yes, built a lofty House for you,
a fixed-place for your [royal] seat, for the ages."
I Kings 12:14,"And the king turned his face and blessed the entire assembly of Israel
while the entire assembly of Israel was standing;"
I Kings 12:15,"he said:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
who promised David my father with his own mouth,
and with his own hand confirmed, saying:"
I Kings 12:16,"From the day that I brought out my people Israel from Egypt,
I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel
[in which] to build a House, to have my name be there.
But I chose David to be over my people Israel,"
I Kings 12:17,"and it was in the heart of David my father to build a House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
I Kings 12:18,"so Y<small>HWH</small> said to David my father:
Because it was in your heart to build a House for my name,
you have done well, for it was in your heart."
I Kings 12:19,"However: <i>you</i> shall not build the House,
rather, your son, the one going out of your loins,
<i>he</i> shall build the House for my name."
I Kings 12:20,"And Y<small>HWH</small> has fulfilled his word which he promised:
I have arisen in the place of David my father,
and have taken seat on the throne of Israel, as Y<small>HWH</small> promised;
I have built the House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
I Kings 12:21,"and I have put there a place for the Coffer, in which is Y<small>HWH</small>’s covenant
that he cut with our fathers, when he brought them out from the land of Egypt."
I Kings 12:22,"Then Shelomo stood in front of the altar of Y<small>HWH</small>, opposite the entire assembly of Israel,
and he spread his palms heavenward"
I Kings 12:23,"and said:
O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel,
there is none like you as a god
in the heavens above or on the earth beneath,
keeping the covenant, loyalty with your servants, those who walk in your presence with all their heart,"
I Kings 12:24,"who has kept regarding your servant David my father what you promised him;
you promised with your own mouth and with your own hand confirmed, as is this day."
I Kings 12:25,"So-now, Y<small>HWH</small> God of Israel,
keep for your servant David my father what you promised him, saying:
There will never be a man cut off from you in my presence,
sitting on the throne of Israel—
if only your sons keep their way, walking in my presence
as you have walked in my presence!"
I Kings 12:26,"So-now, O God of Israel,
pray let your word be confirmed that you promised to your servant David my father."
I Kings 12:27,"But will God really reside on earth?
Here, the heavens and the heavenmost heavens cannot contain you,
how much less this House that I have built!"
I Kings 12:28,"Yet turn your face to the prayer of your servant, and to his plea, O Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
to hearken to the cry-of-praise and to the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence today,"
I Kings 12:29,"that your eyes may be open toward this House, night and day,
toward the place about which you said: My name will be there,
to hearken to the prayer that your servant will pray toward this place."
I Kings 12:30,"And when you hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel
that they will pray toward this place—
then may <i>you</i> hearken at the place of your [royal] seat in the heavens;
may you hearken and may you forgive!"
I Kings 12:31,"Should a person sin against his neighbor
and he lifts up an oath-curse upon him, to put him under a curse,
and he comes with the oath-curse before your altar, in this House—"
I Kings 12:32,"then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens
and may you act and judge your servants,
to bring punishment on the guilty, by putting his way on his head,
and to vindicate the innocent, by giving him according to his innocence."
I Kings 12:33,"When your people Israel is defeated before an enemy, because
they have sinned against you,
and then they return to you and praise your name,
and they pray and plead to you in this House,"
I Kings 12:34,"then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens
and may you forgive the sin of your people Israel,
and return them to the soil that you gave to their fathers."
I Kings 12:35,"When the heavens are held back, and there is no early-rain,
because they have sinned against you,
and they pray toward this place, and praise your name,
and from their sin they turn, since you afflicted them—"
I Kings 12:36,"then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens,
and may you forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel,
so that you instruct them the good way in which they should walk,
and may you give rain upon your land which you gave to your people as heriditary-property."
I Kings 12:37,"A famine—if it should come upon the land;
pestilence—if it should come;
blight, green-mildew, ravaging locust, grasshopper—if it should come;
if his enemy should put him in straits in one of his gates;
whatever the affliction, whatever the sickness:"
I Kings 12:38,"[for] any prayer, any plea that any person might have among any of your people Israel
who knows the affliction in his heart, and spreads his palms toward this House—"
I Kings 12:39,"then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens, the fixed-place of your [royal] seat;
may you forgive and act, giving to each according to all his ways,
[seeing] that you know his heart,
for you yourself know the heart of every human being,"
I Kings 12:40,in order that they may hold you in awe all the days that they live on the face of the ground that you have given to our fathers.
I Kings 12:41,"And also to the foreigner, who is not from your people Israel,
but comes from a land far off for the sake of your name,"
I Kings 12:42,"for he hears of your great name
and your strong hand and your outstretched arm,
and comes and prays toward this House—"
I Kings 12:43,"may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens, the fixed-place of your [royal] seat,
and may you act,
in accordance with all that the foreigner calls out to you,
in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name,
holding you in awe as your people Israel [does],
and acknowledging that your name is called over this House that I have built."
I Kings 12:44,"When your people goes out to battle against its enemy, on the road that you send them,
and they pray to Y<small>HWH</small>, toward the city that you have chosen
and the House that I have built for your name—"
I Kings 12:45,"then may you hearken in the heavens to their prayer and to their plea,
and may you act justly toward them."
I Kings 12:46,"When they sin against you
—for there is no human being who does not sin—
and you rage against them, and give them before the enemy,
and they lead them captive, their captors, to the land of their enemy, far or near,"
I Kings 12:47,"but then they turn their heart in the land to which they were led captive,
and return and plead to you in the land of their captivity, saying:
We have sinned and we have done perversely, we have done wickedly!,"
I Kings 12:48,"and they return to you with all their heart and with all their being, in the land of their enemies who led them captive,
and they pray to you toward their land that you gave their fathers,
the city that you chose and the House that I have built to your name—"
I Kings 12:49,"then may you hearken in the heavens, the fixed-place of your [royal] seat,
to their prayer and to their plea;
may you act justly toward them"
I Kings 12:50,"and forgive your people who have sinned against you
for all the rebellious acts through which they have rebelled against you,
and grant them compassion before their captors, that they may have compassion on them."
I Kings 12:51,"For they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out from Egypt, from amid the iron furnace,"
I Kings 12:52,"so that your eyes may be open to the plea of your servant, and to the plea of your people Israel,
to hearken to them whenever they call out to you."
I Kings 12:53,"For <i>you</i> have set them apart for yourself as an inheritance
from all the peoples of the earth,
as you promised by the hand of Moshe your servant, when you brought out our fathers from Egypt, O Y<small>HWH</small> God!"
I Kings 12:54,"Now it was, when Shelomo had finished praying to Y<small>HWH</small> all this prayer and plea,
that he arose from in front of the altar of Y<small>HWH</small>, from bending down on his knees, with his palms spread toward the heavens,"
I Kings 12:55,"and he stood
and he blessed
the entire assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying:"
I Kings 12:56,"Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>,
who has given rest to his people Israel, exactly as he promised;
not one thing has failed of all his good words which he promised by the hand of Moshe his servant!"
I Kings 12:57,"May Y<small>HWH</small> our God be with us
as he was with our fathers
—may he not abandon us, may he not leave us!—"
I Kings 12:58,"inclining our heart toward him
to walk in all his ways and to keep all his commandments, his laws, and his judgments
which he commanded our fathers.

The Warning; Labor; Shelomo’s Accomplishments: Just as the building of the Temple was preceded by a description of forced labor and accompanying dealings with Hiram king of Tyre, these return in Chap. 9, with some subtle variations. Hiram is not fully content with his payment of twenty Galilee towns in vv.11–14, though in vv.26–28 he does give Shelomo gold from Ofir. In between we are told how Shelomo impressed into service remnants of the Canaanites, whom the Israelites had not been able to totally drive out (see both Joshua and Judges); this, combined with mention of his wife, Pharaoh’s daughter, imparts to the chapter a slightly ominous tone, given that in the Bible Canaanite presence and intermarriage most often bring with them the danger of idolatry.
This feeling is further amplified by the opening section of the chapter (vv.2–9), in which the king, in a second dream at Giv’on, is given a classic Deuteronomistic warning: following in the faithful ways of David will lead to a permanent dynasty, but failing to do so will lead to destruction and exile, with the Temple, so central over the previous four chapters, in ruins. After the glorious description and prayer of Chaps. 6–8, it is a sobering ending—written, perhaps, from the perspective of Israel in exile."
I Kings 13:26,"And may these words of mine which I have pleaded in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
be near to Y<small>HWH</small> our God, day and night,
to render justice [for] his servant and justice [for] his people Israel,
each day’s need in its day,"
I Kings 13:27,"in order for all the peoples of the earth to know
that Y<small>HWH</small>, he is God, there is none else!"
I Kings 13:28,"And may your heart be complete with Y<small>HWH</small> our God,
to walk in his laws and to keep his commandments, as is this day!"
I Kings 13:29,"Now the king and all Israel with him were sacrificing sacrifices in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Kings 13:30,"and Shelomo sacrificed as the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that he sacrificed to Y<small>HWH</small>
twelve thousand oxen and a hundred twenty thousand sheep;
thus they inaugurated the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
the king and all the Children of Israel."
I Kings 13:31,"On that day
the king hallowed the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
for he performed there the offerings-up and the grain-gifts
and the fat parts of the <i>shalom-</i>offerings,
since the bronze altar that was in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> was too small for containing the offerings-up, the grain-gifts, and the fat parts of the <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
I Kings 13:32,"So Shelomo observed the Festival at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assemblage,
[coming] from Levo-Hamat to the Wadi of Egypt,
in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> our God, for seven days and seven days [more],
fourteen days."
I Kings 13:33,"On the eighth day he sent the people off,
and they gave the king farewell-blessing and went back to their tents,
rejoicing and [feeling] good at heart
over all the good things that Y<small>HWH</small> had done for David his servant and for Israel his people."
I Kings 14:1,"Now it was, when Shelomo had finished building the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, and the House of the King,
and every desire of Shelomo that he wished to do,"
I Kings 14:2,"that Y<small>HWH</small> appeared to Shelomo a second time, [just] as he had appeared to him at Giv’on."
I Kings 14:3,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
I have hearkened to your prayer and to your plea which you have pleaded before me—
I have hallowed this House that you have built in which to set my name there throughout the ages;
my eyes and my heart will be there all the days [to come]."
I Kings 14:4,"As for you, if you walk before me
as David your father walked—in wholeness of heart and in uprightness,
doing exactly what I commanded you,
and if my laws and my judgments you will keep,"
I Kings 14:5,"I will establish your kingly throne Israel for the ages,
as I promised regarding David your father, saying:
No one will be cut off from you on the throne of Israel!"
I Kings 14:6,"[But] if you should turn, yes, turn, you and your children, from [following] after me
and do not keep my commandments and my laws that I have placed before you,
but go and serve other gods and bow down to them,"
I Kings 14:7,"I will cut off Israel from the face of the ground that I have given them,
while the House that I have hallowed to my name
I will send away from my presence,
and Israel will become a proverb and a reproach among all peoples."
I Kings 14:8,"And this House will become a ruin;
all who cross by it will be appalled and will whistle, and they will say:
Why did Y<small>HWH</small> do thus to this land and to this House?"
I Kings 14:9,"And they will say:
Because they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small> their God, who brought their fathers out from the land of Egypt;
they held fast to other gods, they bowed down to them and served them—
therefore has Y<small>HWH</small> brought all this evil upon them!"
I Kings 14:10,"Now it was at the end of twenty years during which Shelomo built the two houses,
the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and the House of the King,"
I Kings 14:11,"—Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Shelomo with trees of cedar and trees of juniper, and gold, as much as he desired—
[that] then King Shelomo gave Hiram twenty towns in the region of the Galilee;"
I Kings 14:12,"but when Hiram went out from Tyre, to see the towns that Shelomo had given him,
they were not right in his eyes."
I Kings 14:13,"He said:
What are these towns that you have given me, brother?
So they called them the Region of Cavul/ As Nothing, until this day."
I Kings 14:14,And Hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.
I Kings 14:15,"Now this was the matter of the forced-labor that King Shelomo raised
for building the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, his own House, the Earthfill, the wall of Jerusalem,

I Kings 14:25,"<b>Earthfill:</b> This reference, which occurs a number of times in Samuel and Kings, seems to be to a supporting structure used by Israel’s kings in the building up of Jerusalem. It is often identified with the “Stepped Stone Structure” unearthed just south of the present Old City of Jerusalem. <b>Hatzor:</b> Pronounced <i>hah-TZOR;</i> trad. English “Hazor,” a city north of the Sea of Galilee, on two major trade routes. Its ruins have recently been the site of considerable archaeological activity. <b>Megiddo:</b> Pronounced <i>meh-gee-DOE.</i> Situated at a pass which gives access to major movements of traders and troops from eastern empires down through the Coastal Plain, this was the site of crucial battles throughout antiquity. Its name of the “Hill of Megiddo,” <i>Har Megiddo</i>, has entered the English language as ‘Armageddon”—the Final Battle mentioned in the New Testament (Rev. 16:16) and a general catchword for the end of the world. <b>Gezer:</b> Pronounced <i>GEH-zer.</i> In the foothills west of Jerusalem, not far from modern Ramleh, it controlled yet another route of access: to the Coastal Plain from Jerusalem and the highlands. Thus the three cities mentioned in this verse were of signal strategic importance, and all three have left evidence of almost identical massive buildings, containing chambered gates with casemate walls. Many archaeologists connect these with the period of Shelomo (tenth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), although some date them later.
The Queen’s Visit; Shelomo’s Opulence: In an encounter made famous through legend and art, Shelomo is now visited by the exotic Queen of Sheba. Interpreters have spent centuries speculating on the nature of their relationship, and the last emperor of Ethiopia, the colorful Haile Selassie (ruled 1930–1974), claimed descent from their union. But the text gives no hint of a romantic relationship, and focuses instead on how overwhelmed the queen is by the magnificence of Shelomo and his court. While the meeting (vv.4–9) cites “wisdom” as the thing that makes the greatest impression upon her, it is in fact “gold,” mentioned ten times in vv. 14–25, which dominates the chapter once she has departed. Thus material splendor threatens to overcome the wisdom motif. And the chapter ends with a description of Shelomo’s holdings in horses, exactly the item whose acquisition was warned against in Deut. 17:16, along with a prohibition against amassing too much gold in the very next verse. What we may well have here, then, is a good example of how a tradition originally intended to be a positive one (Shelomo’s splendor) comes, in the context of the next chapter and Deuteronomistic History (DH) overall, to take on a negative tone. The text has its own life, as it were.
The chapter abounds in numbers—not surprising, given that it seeks to impress both the royal visitor and the reader—and makes use mostly of multiples of three and six, beginning with 666 in v.14. Such patterned numbers in many ancient cultures point to the ideas of abundance and perfection. Also notable throughout the chapter is the repetition, from the very first verse, of the Hebrew letter <i>shin</i>; the <i>sh</i>-sounds punctuate the text, as if to echo the queen’s feeling of being overwhelmed by King <i>Sh</i>elomo and his accomplishments."
I Kings 14:26,"—Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up
and had taken Gezer and burned it with fire,
while the Canaanites who were settled in the city he had killed,
and he had given it as a sendoff-gift to his daughter, Shelomo’s wife—"
I Kings 14:27,"Shelomo built Gezer and Lower Bet-Horon,"
I Kings 14:28,"Baalat and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land [of Judah],"
I Kings 14:29,"and all the storage towns that belonged to Shelomo and the chariot towns and the steeds’ towns,
and the desirable things that Shelomo desired to build in Jerusalem and in the Levanon,
and throughout all the land of his rule."
I Kings 14:30,"All the people left from the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites,
the Hivvites, and the Yevusites,
who were not of the Children of Israel,"
I Kings 14:31,"their children who were left after them in the land,
whom the Children of Israel were not able to devote-to-destruction—
Shelomo raised them up for slave labor, until this day."
I Kings 14:32,"But from the Children of Israel Shelomo did not make a slave,
for they were the men of battle, namely, his servants, his commanders, his officers, his chariot commanders, and his steed-riders."
I Kings 14:33,"[And] these were the prefect commanders, Those Over Shelomo’s Work:
fifty and five hundred,
who were supervising the people who were doing the work."
I Kings 14:34,"Nevertheless, Pharaoh’s daughter went up from the City of David to her house which he had built for her;
then he built the Earthfill."
I Kings 14:35,"Now Shelomo would offer up, three times a year, offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings
on the altar that he had built to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and would send up smoke with it, on the one in the presence of Y<small>HWH;</small>
thus he kept the House [in] complete [repair]."
I Kings 14:36,"Now Shelomo made a fleet-of-ships at Etzyon-Gever that is by Elat, next to the Reed Sea in the land of Edom."
I Kings 14:37,"And Hiram sent by ship his servants, the men for ships, those knowing the sea,
along with the servants of Shelomo."
I Kings 14:38,"They came to Ofir and took away gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents,
and they brought it to King Shelomo."
I Kings 15:1,"Now the Queen of Sheba had been hearing the reports of Shelomo, for the fame of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and so she came to test him with riddles."
I Kings 15:2,"She came to Jerusalem with an exceedingly heavy array:
camels carrying spices and gold, in exceeding abundance, and precious stones.
She came to Shelomo and spoke to him all that was on her mind,"
I Kings 15:3,"and Shelomo told her [the answer to] all her words;
there was no matter so hidden from the king that he could not tell her."
I Kings 15:4,"And the Queen of Sheba saw all Shelomo’s wisdom,
and the House that he had built,"
I Kings 15:5,"and the food at his table, the seating of his court-servants, his attendants’ standing and their attire, and his cupbearers,
and his offering[s]-up that he would offer up in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and she was left breathless."
I Kings 15:6,"She said to the king:
True was the word that I heard in my land about your way-with-words, about your wisdom!"
I Kings 15:7,"Now I did not believe the words until I came [here] and my own eyes saw it,
but here: I had not been told the half [of it]:
you have more wisdom and bounty than the report that I had heard!"
I Kings 15:8,"O the happiness of your men, O the happiness of these your servants who stand [in attendance] before you regularly,
who hear your wisdom!"
I Kings 15:9,"May Y<small>HWH</small> your God be blessed,
who has taken pleasure in you,
to place you on the throne of Israel.
Because of Y<small>HWH’s</small> love for Israel, for the ages,
he has made you king, to render justice and equity!"
I Kings 15:10,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold
and an exceeding abundance of spices, and precious stones;
such spices never came again in abundance
that the Queen of Sheba gave King Shelomo."
I Kings 15:11,"And also Hiram’s ships, which carried gold from Ofir,
brought <i>almug</i> wood from Ofir, exceedingly much, and precious stones."
I Kings 15:12,"And the king made from the <i>almug</i> wood railings for the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and for the House of the King,
and lyres and harps for the singers;
no such <i>almug</i> wood had come [before],
and none has been seen until this day."
I Kings 15:13,"Now King Shelomo gave the Queen of Sheba whatever she wished, that she had requested,
aside from what had been given her according to the capacity of King Shelomo.
Then she faced about and went back to her land, she and her servants."
I Kings 15:14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Shelomo in a single year
was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,"
I Kings 15:15,"besides [what came] from the tradesmen and from the commerce of the merchants
and all the kings of Arabia and governors of the land."
I Kings 15:16,"And King Shelomo made two hundred [large] shields of hammered gold,
—six hundred gold pieces would go for each one shield—"
I Kings 15:17,"and three hundred bucklers of hammered gold
—three <i>minas</i> of gold would go for each one buckler—
and the king put them in the House of the Forest of the Levanon."
I Kings 15:18,"And the king made a great throne of ivory,
and he overlaid it with refined gold."
I Kings 15:19,"There were six steps for the throne,
with a rounded top to the throne, on its back,
with armrests on this-side and on that-side at the place of sitting,
and two lions standing beside the armrests,"
I Kings 15:20,"and twelve male-lions standing there on the six steps, on this-side and on that-side;
none such was made in any [other] kingdom."
I Kings 15:21,"Now all of King Shelomo’s drinking vessels were of gold,
while all the vessels of the House of the Forest of the Levanon were of fine gold;
there were none of silver—it was not reckoned of any [value] in the days of Shelomo."
I Kings 15:22,"For the king had a shipping-fleet of Tarshish on the sea,
along with Hiram’s ships;
once out of every three years, a ship of Tarshish would come
carrying gold and silver,
tusks, monkeys, and peacocks."
I Kings 15:23,"So King Shelomo was greater than all the kings of the earth, in riches and in wisdom,"
I Kings 15:24,"and all the earth was seeking Shelomo’s face
to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart;"
I Kings 15:25,"they brought, each one, his tribute:
vessels of silver and vessels of gold,
clothing and weaponry and spices,
horses and mules—
each year’s due in its year."
I Kings 15:26,"And Shelomo gathered chariots and steeds:
he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand steeds,
and he put them in chariot towns and with the king in Jerusalem."
I Kings 15:27,"And the king made the silver in Jerusalem like stones,
while the cedars he made like sycamores that are in the lowlands, in abundance."
I Kings 15:28,"And the import-source of horses for Shelomo was from Egypt and from Kue;
the king’s merchants would get them from Kue at a fixed-price."
I Kings 15:29,"So a chariot imported from Egypt would go for six hundred silver pieces, and a horse for fifty and a hundred.
Thus it was for all the Hittite kings and the Amorite kings;
by their [own] hand they exported them.

Shelomo’s Last Years: Foreign Wives and the Beginnings of Revolt: Despite all the previous emphasis on the king’s wisdom, the Temple, and the glory of the court, the biblical traditions about Shelomo end on an unabashedly negative note. As is usual in Deuteronomistic texts, the eventual collapse of Shelomo’s unified kingdom is attributed to idolatry, brought on by his marriage to foreign women. This is in keeping with the warnings registered in Deut. 7 and 17.
Several motifs which will recur in Kings appear for the first time in this chapter. One is the postponement of punishment until the next generation (v.12), while another is the prophet’s reporting of God’s word to a king (although in this case it is a king-to-be, Yorov’am). That speech, in vv.31–39, is typical of the Deuteronomistic passages in Kings, concentrating as it does on the reason for specific future events.
So Shelomo dies, with his great accomplishments overshadowed for the moment by the imminent dissolution of his kingdom. The rebel Yorov’am waits in the wings, and Shelomo is powerless to eliminate him before his death, unlike the ruthless successes against potential rivals that had marked the beginning of his reign."
I Kings 17:1,"Now King Shelomo loved many foreign women, along with Pharaoh’s daughter:
Moavites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites,"
I Kings 17:2,"from the nations of which Y<small>HWH</small> had said to the Children of Israel:
You are not to come among them and <i>they</i> are not to come among you—
surely, they will incline away your heart after their gods.
To them Shelomo clung in love."
I Kings 17:3,"He had princess wives, seven hundred,
and concubines, three hundred,
and his wives inclined away his heart."
I Kings 17:4,"So it was at the time of Shelomo’s old age:
his wives inclined away his heart after other gods,
and his heart was not complete with Y<small>HWH</small> his God,
like the heart of David his father."
I Kings 17:5,"Shelomo went [following] after Astarte godhead of the Sidonians
and after Milkom the Detestable One of the Ammonites."
I Kings 17:6,"So Shelomo did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH;</small>
he did not fully-follow after Y<small>HWH</small>, like David his father."
I Kings 17:7,"And Shelomo built a sanctuary to Kemosh the Detestable-One of Moav,
on the hill that faces Jerusalem,
and to Molekh, the Detestable One of the Children of Ammon."
I Kings 17:8,"Thus did he do for all his foreign wives,
those sending up smoke and offering-sacrifices to their gods."
I Kings 17:9,"So Y<small>HWH</small> was enraged at Shelomo,
for he had inclined his heart away from Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
who had appeared to him twice,"
I Kings 17:10,"and had commanded him about this matter, not to walk after other gods,
but he had not kept what Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him."
I Kings 17:11,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shelomo:
Because this was your [intention],
namely, you have not kept my covenant and my laws which I commanded you,
I will tear, yes, tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant!"
I Kings 17:12,"However, in your own days I will not do it,
for the sake of David your father;
from the hand of your son I will tear it away."
I Kings 17:13,"Yet I will not tear away the entire kingdom:
one tribe I will give to your son, for the sake of David my servant,
and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."
I Kings 17:14,"So Y<small>HWH</small> raised up an adversary to Shelomo,
Hadad the Edomite, who was from the royal seed in Edom."
I Kings 17:15,"Now it was, when David struck Edom, when Yoav Commander of the Armed-Forces had gone up to bury [all] the slain—
he struck down all the males in Edom,"
I Kings 17:16,"since for six months Yoav and all Israel stayed there, until he had cut off all the males in Edom—"
I Kings 17:17,"that Hadad ran away, he and his fighting-men, Edomites from among his father’s servants with him, to come to Egypt,
and Hadad was [then] a young lad."
I Kings 17:18,"They proceeded from Midyan and came to Pa’ran,
and took fighting-men with them from Pa’ran
and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt;
he gave him a house, and food he assigned for him,
and land he gave him."
I Kings 17:19,"And Hadad found exceeding favor in the eyes of Pharaoh,
so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of the <i>Tah’penes</i>, the queen-mother."
I Kings 17:20,"The sister of the <i>Tah’penes</i> bore him Genuvat his son, and the <i>Tah’penes</i> weaned him amid the house of Pharaoh.
And Genuvat remained in the house of Pharaoh, amid Pharaoh’s sons."
I Kings 17:21,"Now when Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay beside his fathers,
and that Yoav Commander of the Armed-Forces was dead,
Hadad said to Pharaoh:
Send me off, that I may go back to my land."
I Kings 17:22,"Pharaoh said to him:
What do you lack with me
that here, you seek to go back to your land?
He said:
No[thing], but send, send me off!"
I Kings 17:23,"And God raised up against him an[other] adversary,
Rezon son of Elyada,
who had run away from Hadad’ezer king of Tzova, his lord."
I Kings 17:24,"He gathered fighting-men to himself
and became commander of a raiding-band,
when David was killing them,
and he went to Damascus and settled in it, and he became king in Damascus."
I Kings 17:25,"He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Shelomo, along with the evil that Hadad … ;
he felt loathing at Israel,
and he reigned as king over Aram."
I Kings 17:26,"Now Yorov’am son of Nevat the Efratite, from Tzereda,
—his mother’s name was Tzerua, a widow woman—
was a servant of Shelomo,
but he raised a hand against the king."
I Kings 17:27,"And this is the matter in which he raised a hand against the king:
when Shelomo built the Earthfill,
he closed up the breach of the City of David his father."
I Kings 17:28,"Now the man Yorov’am was a mighty-man of valor;
Shelomo saw the lad,
that he was a [skilled] doer of work,
so he appointed him over all the burden-force of the House of Yosef."
I Kings 17:29,"It was at [about] that time,
when Yorov’am went out of Jerusalem,
that Ahiyya the Shilonite, the prophet, encountered him on the road
—he had covered himself with a new cloak—
and the two of them were alone in the open-field."
I Kings 17:30,"And Ahiyya seized the new cloak that was on him
and tore it into twelve torn-pieces;"
I Kings 17:31,"he said to Yorov’am:
Take yourself ten torn-pieces,
for thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Here, I am about to tear away the kingdom from the hand of Shelomo
and will give you the ten tribes,"
I Kings 17:32,"while the one tribe will remain his,
for the sake of my servant David
and for the sake of Jerusalem,
the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel—"
I Kings 17:33,"because he has abandoned me and bowed down to Astarte goddess of the Sidonians,
to Kemosh god of Moav,
and to Milkom god of the Children of Ammon,
and has not walked in my ways,
to do what is right in my eyes—my laws and my judgments,
like David his father."
I Kings 17:34,"But I will not take away the entire kingdom from his hand;
indeed, I will make him exalted-leader all the days of his life,
for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose,
who kept my commandments and my laws."
I Kings 17:35,"But I will take away the kingdom from the hand of his son
and will give it to you,
the ten tribes."
I Kings 17:36,"Yet to his son I will give one tribe,
in order that there may be a lamp for David my servant all the days [to come] in my presence in Jerusalem,
the city that I chose for myself to put my name there."
I Kings 17:37,"And you I will take,
that you may reign as king over all that you crave,
and you shall be king over Israel."
I Kings 17:38,"Now it will be:
if you hearken to all that I command you,
and walk in my ways,
and do what is right in my eyes,
keeping my laws and my commandments
as David my servant did,
then I will be with you;
I will build you a firm house, as I built for David,
and I will give you Israel."
I Kings 17:39,"And I will afflict the seed of David on account of this,
yet not for all the days [to come]."
I Kings 17:40,"Shelomo sought to put Yorov’am to death,
so Yorov’am arose and ran away to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt,
and remained in Egypt until Shelomo’s death."
I Kings 17:41,"Now the rest of the events of Shelomo, and all that he did, and his wisdom—
are they not written in the Record of the Events of Shelomo?"
I Kings 17:42,"Now the days that Shelomo reigned as king in Jerusalem, over all Israel, were forty years;"
I Kings 17:43,"then Shelomo lay beside his fathers,
and he was buried in the City of David his father,
and Rehav’am his son reigned as king in his place.

I Kings 18:21,"<b>exalted-leader:</b> Or “chief” (Heb. <i>nasi</i>). Since this old term is not exactly synonymous with “king,” our verse may be a subtle demoting of Shelomo (Gray 1970)."
I Kings 18:22,"<b>lamp:</b> Found also in 15:4 and II Kings 8:19, this term (Heb. <i>ner</i>) is taken to indicate either dynasty continuity or dominion (<i>nir</i>) in recent scholarship."
I Kings 18:23,"<b>this:</b> Presumably, Shelomo’s deeds."

I Kings 18:26,<b>forty:</b> The standard “magical” number again.
I Kings 18:27,"<b>Rehav’am:</b> Pronounced <i>reh-hav-AHM;</i> meaning either “God [the Kinsman] Has Caused Expansion” or “The People [Kin] Has Expanded”; trad. English “Rehoboam.” Cogan (2001) notes how both his and Yorov’am’s names may point to the prosperity of the Solomonic era.
Rehav’am and the Split; Yorov’am and the Calves: The division of the kingdom is recounted, not by a humdrum description of events, but by a dramatic narrative. We are presented with the age-old clash between the old, to whom experience has taught political wisdom, and the young, who think they know better. The text raises the issue of “serving,” but the real problem is ironically posed here by the ten-time repetition of the word “return”: Will the kingdom be returned to its previous state of wholeness?
In order to prevent the restoration of the newly independent north to the control of Jerusalem, Yorov’am takes the fateful step of constructing two golden calves, in a move that textually echoes the Israelites’ apostasy in Exod. 32. While it is possible, as mentioned above, that this action did not constitute idolatry—the calves, in this view, would have served simply as Y<small>HWH’s</small> symbolic footstool—it certainly was seen that way by subsequent biblical writers/editors, who trace all of the kingdom of Israel’s troubles back to this moment. Thus every northern king will be compared to Yorov’am, “who made Israel to sin.” To compound his central crime in the eyes of southern writers, Yorov’am makes priests of non-Levites and establishes a new holy day on the calendar. In Walsh’s words, “he celebrates at the wrong time, in the wrong place, on the wrong altar, in honor of the wrong gods.”"
I Kings 19:1,"Rehav’am went to Shekhem,
for to Shekhem all Israel came to make him king."
I Kings 19:2,"And it was, when Yorov’am son of Nevat heard—he was still in Egypt, where he had run away from before King Shelomo—
that Yorov’am returned from Egypt."
I Kings 19:3,"They sent and called for him, and Yorov’am and the entire assembly of Israel came
and spoke to Rehav’am, saying:"
I Kings 19:4,"Your father made our yoke hard,
but <i>you</i> now, lighten your father’s hard servitude
and the heavy yoke that he placed upon us,
and we will serve you!"
I Kings 19:5,"He said to them:
Go off for three days, and [then] return to me.
So the people went off."
I Kings 19:6,"And King Rehav’am sought advice from the elders who had stood before Shelomo his father when he was alive, saying:
How do you advise returning word to this people?"
I Kings 19:7,"They spoke to him, saying:
If today you would be servant to this people, and would serve them,
then answer them and speak good words to them,
and they will be servants to you all the days [to come]."
I Kings 19:8,"But he abandoned the advice of the elders which they had advised him;
he sought advice from the youngsters who had grown up with him, who were standing [in service] before him."
I Kings 19:9,"He said to them:
What do you advise that we return as word to this people,
who spoke to me, saying:
Lighten the yoke that your father placed upon us!?"
I Kings 19:10,"The youngsters who had grown up with him said:
Say thus to this people who spoke to you, saying:
Your father made our yoke heavy,
but you—lighten [it] from upon us!
Thus should you speak to them:
My little-thing is thicker than my father’s loins!"
I Kings 19:11,"So-now:
my father loaded a heavy yoke upon you,
but <i>I</i> will add to your yoke;
my father disciplined you with whips,
but <i>I</i> will discipline you with “scorpions”!"
I Kings 19:12,"So when Yorov’am and the people came to Rehav’am on the third day,
as the king had spoken to them, saying: Return to me on the third day."
I Kings 19:13,"And the king answered the people roughly;
he abandoned the advice of the elders that they had advised"
I Kings 19:14,"and spoke to them according to the advice of the youngsters, saying:
My father made your yoke heavy,
but <i>I</i> will add to your yoke;
my father disciplined you with whips,
but <i>I</i> will discipline you with “scorpions”!"
I Kings 19:15,"Now the king did not hearken to the people,
for it was a reversal-of-events from Y<small>HWH</small>,
in order that he might fulfill his word that Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken by the hand of Ahiyya the Shilonite to Yorov’am son of Nevat."
I Kings 19:16,"And all Israel saw that the king had not hearkened to them,
so the people returned word to the king, saying:
What portion do we have in David?
No inheritance in the son of Yishai!
To your tents, O Israel!
Now—see to your own house, O David!
And Israel went back to their tents."
I Kings 19:17,"But as for the Children of Israel who were settled in the towns of Judah,
Rehav’am reigned as king over them."
I Kings 19:18,"And King Rehav’am sent Adoram, [The One] Over the Forced-Labor,
but all Israel pelted him with stones, so that he died,
while King Rehav’am managed to go up into a chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
I Kings 19:19,So Israel rebelled against the House of David—until this day.
I Kings 19:20,"Now it was, when all Israel heard that Yorov’am had returned,
that they sent and called him to the Community
and made him king over all Israel;
there was no one [following] after the House of David except for the tribe of Yehuda alone."
I Kings 19:21,"Rehav’am came to Jerusalem, and he assembled the entire House of Judah, along with the tribe of Binyamin,
a hundred eighty thousand chosen ones, ready for battle,
to do battle with the House of Israel,
to return the kingship to Rehav’am son of Shelomo."
I Kings 19:22,"But the word of God [came] to Shema’ya, the man of God, saying:"
I Kings 19:23,"Say to Rehav’am son of Shelomo, king of Judah, and to the entire House of Judah, and Binyamin
and the rest of the people, saying:"
I Kings 19:24,"Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
You are not to go up, you are not to do battle with your brothers, the Children of Israel;
return, each one to his house, for from me is this matter!
They hearkened to the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and they turned back, going in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 19:25,"Yorov’am built up Shekhem in the highlands of Efrayim, and held seat in it;
then he went out from there and built up Penuel."
I Kings 19:26,"And Yorov’am said in his heart:
Now the kingdom may [well] return to the House of David;"
I Kings 19:27,"if this people should go up to make sacrifices at the House of Y<small>HWH</small> in Jerusalem,
the heart of the people will turn back to their lord, to Rehav’am king of Judah,
and they will kill me
and return to Rehav’am king of Judah!"
I Kings 19:28,"So the king sought advice,
and made two calves of gold.
He said to them:
Enough for you, going up to Jerusalem!
Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!"
I Kings 19:29,"He put the one at Bet-El,
while the [other] one he placed at Dan."
I Kings 19:30,"So this matter became a sin.
And the people went before the one, as far as Dan."
I Kings 19:31,"He made a temple-house [for] the sanctuaries,
and made priests from [all] quarters of the people who were not from the Sons of Levi."
I Kings 19:32,"And Yorov’am made a pilgrimage-festival in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month,
like the Festival that is in Judah,
and he went up on the sacrificial-altar;
thus did he make at Bet-El,
to offer-sacrifices to the calves that he had made,

The North: Prophets and Predictions: The Yorov’am story continues in an unprecedented and directly Deuteronomistic way: a prophet, here termed a “man of God,” predicts that a purge conducted by King Yoshiyyahu (Josiah), fully three centuries hence, will undo the results of Yorov’am’s terrible idolatry. When the king stretches out his hand against the prophet, it withers, and is restored (lit. “returned”) only after the king requests the prophet’s intercession. And the recurrence of the verb “return” is once again the key here. The man of God is told by God to go home by another route, and he refuses hospitality from both Yorov’am and another prophet living in Bet-El. But eventually he relents, eating and drinking with the old prophet, and the result is his death, seen as a punishment from God. The end (and, to my mind, the main point) of the matter is that Yorov’am does not “return” from his wicked path, but instead “returns” to the appointing of illegitimate priests. Things will not go back to the way they were. The north and the south have split forever.
Simon (1997) focuses on the other main theme in this chapter, which is a significant one in the Early Prophets: the divine word will be fulfilled, even if the messenger (the “man of God”) does not obey as he is told. It may take centuries, but the “signs” and “portents” will come to pass. In v.26, the old prophet understands his colleague’s death as fulfilling God’s word; v.32 equally points ahead to Yoshiyyahu’s time, when the earlier prophecy regarding the altar will also come to fruition.
The enduring image in the last section is reminiscent of fairy tales. We are treated to the sight of the man of God’s corpse, the lion who has killed him, and his unharmed donkey standing in the road. Walsh sees the animals as a kind of “honor guard,” and indeed, the whole story has a kind of tragic nobility. The old prophet recognizes the truth of the man of God’s word, and seeks fellowship with his colleague (Walsh notes the play on <i>shuv</i>, “return,” accomplished through multiple occurrences of <i>yashov</i>, “sit/settle”) in death just as he had, with disastrous results, in life. For Walsh, the fate of the two prophets who have gone astray mirrors the eventual fate of the two kingdoms from which they hail.
and he had them stand at Bet-El [to officiate], the priests of the sanctuaries that he had made."
I Kings 20:20,"And he went up on the altar that he had made at Bet-El
on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the month that he had devised of his own heart;
so he made a festival for the Children of Israel.
And he went up on the altar, to send-up-smoke,"
I Kings 21:1,"when here, a man of God was coming from Judah by the word of Y<small>HWH</small> to Bet-El.
As Yorov’am was standing by the altar to send up smoke,"
I Kings 21:2,"he called over the altar with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,
he said:
O Altar! Altar!
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Here, a son will be born to the House of David, Yoshiyyahu his name;
he will slay upon you
the priests of the sanctuaries who are sending up smoke upon you,
and human bones will he burn upon you!"
I Kings 21:3,"And he gave a portent on that day, saying:
This is the portent that Y<small>HWH</small> has spoken:
Here, the altar will be torn apart,
and spilled out will be the ash-heap that is on it!"
I Kings 21:4,"And it was, when the king heard the word of the man of God which he called out over the altar at Bet-El,
that Yorov’am stretched out his hand from over the altar, saying:
Seize him!
But his hand dried up, the one that he stretched out against him,
and he was not able to return it to himself."
I Kings 21:5,"And the altar was torn apart,
and the ashes spilled from the altar,
in accordance with the portent that the man of God had given him by the hand of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 21:6,"Then the king spoke up and said to the man of God:
Now soothe the face of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
and pray on my behalf, that my hand may be returned-in-health to me!
And the man of God soothed the face of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so that the king’s hand was returned-in-health to him,
and became as at the beginning."
I Kings 21:7,"The king spoke to the man of God:
Come back with me to the house and be refreshed,
so that I may give you a gift."
I Kings 21:8,"But the man of God said to the king:
If you were to give me half your house
I would not come back with you,
I would not eat food, I would not drink water in this place,"
I Kings 21:9,"for thus I was commmanded by the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
You are not to eat food, you are not to drink water,
and you are not to return by the way that you went!"
I Kings 21:10,"So he went off by another way,
and did not return by the way that he had come to Bet-El."
I Kings 21:11,"Now an old prophet was settled at Bet-El.
And his sons came and recounted to him all the doings that the man of God had done that day in Bet-El;
the words that he had spoken to the king,
they recounted them to their father."
I Kings 21:12,"Their father spoke to them:
By which way did he go?
—His sons had seen the way by which the man of God had gone, who had come from Judah.—"
I Kings 21:13,"He said to his sons:
Saddle a donkey for me.
So they saddled a donkey for him, and he mounted it,"
I Kings 21:14,"and he went after the man of God;
he found him sitting under an oak
and said to him:
Are you the man of God who came from Judah?
He said:
I am."
I Kings 21:15,"He said to him:
Go back with me to the house and eat [some] food."
I Kings 21:16,"He said:
I am not able to return with you, to come back with you,
and I will not eat food, I will not drink water with you in this place,"
I Kings 21:17,"for the word [came to me] by the word of Y<small>HWH:</small>
You are not to eat food, you are not to drink water there;
you are not to return, going by the way on which you went!"
I Kings 21:18,"He said to him:
I too am a prophet like you,
and a messenger spoke to me by the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Have him return with you to your house,
that he may eat food and drink water!
—He was lying to him."
I Kings 21:19,"So he returned with him
and ate food in his house, and drank water."
I Kings 21:20,"Now it was:

I Kings 21:21,"and he called out to the man who had come from Judah, saying:

Because you have revolted against Y<small>HWH</small>’s order
and have not kept the command that Y<small>HWH</small> your God commanded,"
I Kings 21:22,"but have returned and eaten food and drunk water in the place of which he spoke to you:
Do not eat food and do not drink water!—
your corpse shall not come to the burial-place of your fathers!

Yorov’am and Rehav’am: Instead of merely focusing on events and policies of the kings’ reigns, the narrative now keeps the events on a personal level. As with the story of the “Wise Woman of Tekoa” in II Sam. 14, a deception is initially practiced through a female messenger, but the truth manages to come out. Ahiyya the prophet, using strident, colorful language that will recur in reference to King Ah’av (Ahab), foretells the downfall of Yorov’am’s dynasty and the eventual exile of Israel. It is jarring to hear this so early in the book, but it has the effect of setting up a pattern of prophecy and fulfillment that is very much at the ideological center of the book of Kings (Walsh).
Almost nothing is attributed to Rehav’am’s reign except for Judah’s idolatrous practices. The Egyptian invasion that follows in vv.25ff. therefore feels not merely political but punitive. And Rehav’am’s death notice departs from the usual formula in that his mother is mentioned again (see v.21), perhaps because she is an Ammonite—emphasizing Shelomo’s sin of intermarriage once more."
I Kings 21:30,"And it was,
after his eating food and after his drinking,
that the donkey was saddled for him, belonging to the prophet who had had him return."
I Kings 21:31,"He went off, and a lion encountered him on the way, and caused his death,
and his corpse was [left] thrown into the way,
with the donkey standing near him,
while the lion was standing near the corpse."
I Kings 21:32,"Now here, some men were crossing by,
and they saw the corpse thrown into the way, with the lion standing near the corpse,
so they came and spoke [of it] in the town where the old prophet was settled."
I Kings 21:33,"And he heard, the prophet who had had him return from the way, and he said:
He is the man of God who revolted against Y<small>HWH’s</small> order,
so Y<small>HWH</small> gave him to the lion, so that he mangled him and put him to death,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had spoken to him."
I Kings 21:34,"And he spoke to his sons, saying:
Saddle me the donkey!
And they saddled it."
I Kings 21:35,"He went and found the corpse thrown in the way,
with the donkey and the lion standing near the corpse—
the lion had not eaten the corpse, and had not mangled the donkey!"
I Kings 21:36,"And the prophet lifted up the corpse of the man of God and put it on the donkey, and had him return;
then he came to the town of the old prophet, to beat [the breast] and to bury him."
I Kings 21:37,"He put his corpse in his [own] burial-place
and they beat [the breast] over him: Alas, my brother!"
I Kings 21:38,"And it was, after he buried him, that he said to his sons, saying:
When I die, you are to bury me in the burial-place where the man of God is buried;
near his bones put my bones."
I Kings 21:39,"For it will come, come-to-pass, the word that he called out by the word of Y<small>HWH</small>
concerning the altar that is in Bet-El and concerning all the sanctuary buildings that are in the towns of Shomeron."
I Kings 21:40,"After this matter, Yorov’am did not return from his evil way,
but he returned to making priests from [all] quarters of the people for the sanctuaries;
[to] whoever desired, he would give mandate, and he became a priest at the sanctuaries."
I Kings 21:41,"So this matter became a sin by the House of Yorov’am,
for effacing, for erasing [it] from the surface of the ground."
I Kings 22:1,"At [about] that time,
Aviyya son of Yorov’am became sick."
I Kings 22:2,"Yorov’am said to his wife:
Now arise and change your [appearance],
so that they will not know that you are Yorov’am’s wife,
and go to Shilo
—there is Ahiyya the prophet; it was he [who] declared me as king over this people—"
I Kings 22:3,"and take in your hand ten bread-loaves and biscuits and a bottle of honey
and come to him;
<i>he</i> will tell you what will happen to the lad."
I Kings 22:4,"Yorov’am’s wife did thus:
she arose and went to Shilo, and came to the house of Ahiyya.
Now Ahiyyahu was not able to see,
for his eyes were set from his hoary-age."
I Kings 22:5,"But God had said to Ahiyyahu:
Here, Yorov’am’s wife is coming
to search out a word through you concerning her son, for he is sick;
like this and like that you are to speak to her.
And it will be that when she comes, she will act-like-a-stranger."
I Kings 22:6,"Now it was, when Ahiyyahu heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the entrance,
that he said:
Come in, Yorov’am’s wife,
why now do you act-like-a-stranger?
I myself am sent to you with a hard [message]:"
I Kings 22:7,"Go, say to Yorov’am:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Because I exalted you from the midst of the people,
and made you <i>Nagid</i> over my people Israel,"
I Kings 22:8,"and tore the kingdom away from the House of David and gave it to you
—but you have not been like my servant David,
who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart,
doing only what was right in my eyes;"
I Kings 22:9,"you have done evil, more than all who were before you,
you have gone and made yourself other gods, namely molten ones, to provoke me,
and me you have thrown behind your back—"
I Kings 22:10,"therefore:
here, I am bringing evil upon the House of Yorov’am:
I will cut off from Yorov’am he who pisses against the wall,
[even] those fettered and forsaken in Israel,
and I will eradicate after [you] the House of Yorov’am
as a ball of dung is burned, until it is gone."
I Kings 22:11,"He who dies of Yorov’am in the city, the dogs will eat,
while he who dies in the open-field, the birds of the heavens will eat;

I Kings 22:16,"He will give Israel up, on account of Yorov’am’s sins which he sinned, and which he caused Israel to sin."
I Kings 22:17,"Yorov’am’s wife arose
and went back to Tirtza;
[just as] she was coming in to the threshold of the house,
the child died."
I Kings 22:18,"They buried him and all Israel beat [the breast] for him,
according to the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had spoken by the hand of his servant Ahiyyahu the prophet."
I Kings 22:19,"Now the rest of the events of Yorov’am,
how he waged battle and how he reigned as king—
here, they are written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel."
I Kings 22:20,"Now the days that Yorov’am reigned as king were twenty and two years;
then he lay beside his fathers,
and Nadav his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 22:21,"Now Rehav’am son of Shelomo reigned as king in Judah:
forty-one years old was Rehav’am at his becoming king,
and for seventeen years he reigned as king in Jerusalem,
the city that Y<small>HWH</small> had chosen to put his name there from all the tribes of Israel;
his mother’s name was Naama the Ammonite."
I Kings 22:22,"And Judah did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH:</small>
they aroused his zealous-indignation more than all their fathers had done, in the sins that they sinned."
I Kings 22:23,"They too built for themselves sanctuaries and standing-pillars and Ashera-poles
on every lofty hill and under every luxuriant tree."
I Kings 22:24,"And there were even [male] prostitutes in the land;
they did according to all the abominable deeds of the nations that Y<small>HWH</small> had dispossessed before the Children of Israel."
I Kings 22:25,"Now it was
in the fifth year of King Rehav’am,
that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem."
I Kings 22:26,"He took away the treasures of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and the treasures of the king’s house
—he took everything.
He [even] took all the gold bucklers that Shelomo had made,"
I Kings 22:27,"so King Rehav’am made, in their place, bronze bucklers;
he would entrust them to the hand of the Commanders of the Outrunners, those on watch at the entrance to the king’s house.

The accession of a relatively “good” king in the south, Asa, whose religious reforms mildly foreshadow the notable ones of later Judean kings, is tempered by his failure to remove the “sanctuaries,” a serious shortcoming from the Deuteronomistic point of view, which advocates centralized worship in Jerusalem.
Two important messages come through by the end of the chapter: the introduction of assassination as a normal means of succession in the Northern Kingdom, and the concomitant end of Yorov’am’s dynasty.

Northern Kings: Continuing the instability manifest in the last chapter, there are two coups subsequent to Ba’sha’s twenty-four-year rule, a reign about which the text again reports next to nothing. The result is the accession of Omri, whose dynasty will last for four decades and will appear by name in Assyrian records. Ominously, v.25 characterizes him as the most evil king to date, but the same will later be said of his son Ah’av (twice, in vv.30 and 34). The latter’s great offense consists in his marrying a Phoenician princess and thus greatly furthering the worship of the fertility god Baal in Israel."

Eliyyahu Makes His Appearance: Once we have been introduced to the arch northern king, Ah’av, the great prophetic figure of Eliyyahu appears, as if from nowhere. This suddenness will characterize his persona throughout. Unlike previous prophets, he is thoroughly associated with the miraculous from the very beginning: ravens feed him, he produces an abundance of food from a skimpy amount, and he brings a child who has died back to life. In the larger context, it is the phrase and concept of the “word of God” that echoes here, and the chapter ends with the widow’s ringing affirmation that Eliyyahu possesses it."

and a little oil in a jug …,
for here, I have been gathering two pieces-of-wood;
I will come home and make it for me and for my son,
and we will eat it and die."
I Kings 27:13,"Eliyyahu said to her:
Do not be afraid;
go, do according to your words,
but make me a small baked-cake from there first, and bring it out to me,
while for you and for your son, make [some] afterward."
I Kings 27:14,"For thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
The jar of meal will not be finished
and the jug of oil will not be lacking
until the day of Y<small>HWH’s</small> giving showers upon the face of the ground!"
I Kings 27:15,"She went and did according to the word of Eliyyahu,
and she ate, she and he and her household, for some days."
I Kings 27:16,"The jar of meal was not finished
and the jug of oil was not lacking,
according to the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had spoken by the hand of Eliyyahu.

I Kings 27:20,"<b>Izevel:</b> The name (pronounced <i>ee-ZEH-vel</i>), like I-Khavod in I Sam. 4:21, may be a negative judgment in Hebrew (lit., “Where is the Exalted One?”).

I Kings 28:5,"<b>a palmful of meal:</b> A similar lack of food is noted in the Ugaritic epic of Kirta, as Mann remarks. In our story in general, the question concerns which god, Y<small>HWH</small> or Baal (who is featured in Ugaritic texts), will provide for the people. <b>two:</b> Or “a few.”
Eliyyahu and Ovadyahu; The Contest at Mount Carmel: The transition of Eliyyahu from a mysterious, isolated prophet to a significant public figure is facilitated by the introduction of a secondary character, Ovadyahu, literally “Servant of YHWH,” who in an earlier persecution of YHWH’s prophets had heroically hidden them. By v.17, Eliyyahu confronts the king, and sets up the famous contest between himself and the prophets of Baal—or, more properly, between YHWH and Baal. The setting is striking: the great promontory overlooking the Mediterranean, the upper part of today’s Haifa, still called the Carmel. Down the coast from Sidon, it continues to serve as the backdrop for Eliyyahu’s mission in Baal country, so to speak. The contest itself is as theatrical as anything in the Bible. At the center are contrasts: the lone Eliyyahu against the 450 prophets of Baal; Eliyyahu’s dialoguing with the people versus the purely ritual behavior of his opponents; and, most notably, his calm demeanor, contrasted with their “ranting” and self-mutilation. The latter, of course, produces no results, whereas Eliyyahu’s heart-felt words in vv.36–37, punctuated by a twofold “know” (the motif of the public acknowledgment of God), lead to the miraculous descent of fire onto the altar. The special effects are spectacular: the fire consumes not only the sacrifice but the altar itself, and the stones and dust, and the water which Eliyyahu had previously poured over the altar. Moreover, the behavior of the prophets of Baal is mocked, mirroring a treatment of other religious systems that appears frequently in the Bible. In the end, therefore, after the slaughter of those prophets, we should not be surprised that the rains, which had been hitherto withheld, burst out of the sky. Their suddenness is not only reflective of Middle Eastern reality, but is also an indication of where the power really lies. Baal was worshipped in the region chiefly as a storm god, so the polemic is unmistakable."
I Kings 28:6,"Now after these events it was
that he became sick,
the son of the woman, the mistress of the house.
And his sickness was exceedingly strong,
until no breath was left in him."
I Kings 28:7,"She said to Eliyyahu:
What have I to do with you, O man of God?
You have come to me to bring my iniquity to mind, to cause the death of my son!"
I Kings 28:8,"He said to her:
Give me your son.
And he took him from her bosom and brought him up to the upper room, where he was staying,
and had him lie on his bed;"
I Kings 28:9,"then he called out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and said:
O Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
upon the very widow with whom I am lodging
will you bring evil, to cause the death of her son?"
I Kings 28:10,"And he measured himself out upon the child, three times,
and called out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and said:
O Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
pray let the life of this child return within him!"
I Kings 28:11,"And Y<small>HWH</small> hearkened to the voice of Eliyyahu;
the life of the child returned within him, so that he lived."
I Kings 28:12,"Then Eliyyahu took the child
and brought him down from the upper-room into the house,
and gave him to his mother.
Eliyyahu said:
See, your son is alive!"
I Kings 28:13,"The woman said to Eliyyahu:
Now indeed I know
that you are a man of God,
and that the word of Y<small>HWH</small> in your mouth is truth!"
I Kings 29:1,"Now it was many days [later]
that the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Eliyyahu
in the third year, saying,
Go, appear to Ah’av,
that I may give rain upon the face of the ground."
I Kings 29:2,"So Eliyyahu went to appear to Ah’av.
—Now the famine was strong in Shomeron.—"
I Kings 29:3,"And Ah’av called for Ovadyahu/Servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, [The One] Over the Household,
—now Ovadyahu held Y<small>HWH</small> in awe exceedingly;"
I Kings 29:4,"it was, when Izevel cut off the prophets of Y<small>HWH</small>,
that Ovadyahu had taken a hundred prophets
and had hidden them, fifty men in a cave, and sustained them with bread and water—"
I Kings 29:5,"and Ah’av said to Ovadyahu:
Come, let us cross through the land, to all the springs of water and to all the wadis.
Perhaps we will find some green grass, that we may keep horse and mule alive,
and will not have to cut off [any] of the animals."
I Kings 29:6,"So they divided the land between them, to cross through it:
Ah’av went on one road alone,
and Ovadyahu went on another road alone."
I Kings 29:7,"Now when Ovadyahu was on the road:
here was Eliyyahu, [coming] to meet him!
He recognized him, flung himself on his face and said:
Is it really you, my lord Eliyyahu?"
I Kings 29:8,"He said to him:
[It is] I.
Go, say to your lord: Eliyyahu is here!"
I Kings 29:9,"But he said:
How have I sinned,
that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ah’av, to cause my death?"
I Kings 29:10,"By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
if there be a nation or a kingdom where my lord has not sent there to seek you … ,
and when they say: He is not [here],
he makes the kingdom or the nation swear that they did not find you."
I Kings 29:11,"But now <i>you</i> say:
Go, say to your lord: Eliyyahu is here!"
I Kings 29:12,"It will be
that <i>I</i> will go from you,
and the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> will carry you to I know not where,
and I will come to tell Ah’av, and he will not find you—
so he will kill me!
Yet your servant has held Y<small>HWH</small> in awe since my youth."
I Kings 29:13,"Has it not been told to my lord what I did when Izevel was killing the prophets of Y<small>HWH:</small>
how I hid a hundred men of the prophets of Y<small>HWH</small>,
fifty men, fifty men [each] in a cave,
and sustained them with bread and water?"
I Kings 29:14,"But now <i>you</i> say:
Go, say to your lord: Eliyyahu is here!
So he will kill me!"
I Kings 29:15,"Eliyyahu said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, before whom I stand,
indeed, today I will appear to him!"
I Kings 29:16,"So Ovadyahu went to meet Ah’av, and he told him,
and Ah’av went to meet Eliyyahu."
I Kings 29:17,"And it was, when Ah’av saw Eliyyahu,
that Ah’av said to him:
Is this you, bringer-of-disaster on Israel?"
I Kings 29:18,"He said:
I have not brought-disaster on Israel,
but rather you and your Father’s House,
in that you have abandoned Y<small>HWH’s</small> commandments
and have walked after the Baals!"
I Kings 29:19,"So-now,
send [messengers], gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel,
along with the prophets of Baal, four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of Ashera, four hundred,
those eating at Izevel’s table."
I Kings 29:20,"Ah’av sent [messengers] among all the Children of Israel
and gathered the prophets at Mount Carmel."
I Kings 29:21,"And Eliyyahu came close to all the people and said:
How long will you hop on two branches?
If Y<small>HWH</small> is God, walk after him,
and if Baal, walk after him!
But the people did not answer him a word."
I Kings 29:22,"Eliyyahu said to the people:
<i>I</i> am left of the prophets of Y<small>HWH</small>, myself alone,
while the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men."
I Kings 29:23,"Let two bulls be given us,
and let them choose one bull for themselves,
and let them section it and put it atop the wood,
but fire they shall not put [on it].
<i>I</i> will prepare the other bull
and place it atop the wood,
but fire I will not put [on it]."
I Kings 29:24,"And you are to call on the name of your god,
while <i>I</i> will call on the name of Y<small>HWH</small>.
And it will be:
the god who answers with fire, he is God.
All the people answered, they said: The matter is good!"
I Kings 29:25,"Then Eliyyahu said to the prophets of Baal:
Choose yourselves the one bull and prepare [it] first, for you are the many,
and call upon the name of your god,
but fire you are not to put [on it]."
I Kings 29:26,"So they took the bull that he gave them and prepared [it],
and they called upon the name of Baal, from daybreak until noon, saying:
O Baal, answer us!
But there was no voice, and no one answering.
And they hopped all around the altar that they had prepared."
I Kings 29:27,"Now it was at noon, that Eliyyahu taunted them; he said:
Call out in a great voice, for he is a god!
Maybe he is busy—maybe “doing his business”—or maybe on the road for himself;
perhaps he is asleep and will wake up!"
I Kings 29:28,"So they called out in a great voice
and gashed themselves after their practice with swords and lances,
until blood spilled out over them."
I Kings 29:29,"And it was, when noon had passed, that they ranted on until the [time of the] offering up of the grain-gift,
but there was no voice, no one answering, and no attention."
I Kings 29:30,"Then Eliyyahu said to all the people:
Come close to me!
And all the people came close to him.
He mended the wrecked altar of Y<small>HWH;</small>"
I Kings 29:31,"then Eliyyahu took twelve stones, like the number of tribes of the Children of Yaakov,
to whom the word of Y<small>HWH</small> had [come], saying:
Israel shall be your name!,"
I Kings 29:32,"and he built the stones [into] an altar, to the name of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and made a channel [big enough] to house two <i>sei’as</i> of seed all around the altar;"
I Kings 29:33,"then he arranged the wood
and sectioned the bull
and placed it atop the wood,"
I Kings 29:34,"and said:
Fill four jugs with water
and pour it on the offering-up and on the wood.
And he said:
Double it! And they doubled it.
And he said:
Triple it! And they tripled it,"
I Kings 29:35,"so that water went all around the altar,
and also the channel filled up with water."
I Kings 29:36,"And it was, at the [time of] offering-up the grain-gift,
that Eliyyahu the prophet came close and said:
Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yisrael,
today let it be known
that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant,
and that it is by your word that I have done all these things."
I Kings 29:37,"Answer me, O Y<small>HWH</small>, answer me,
that this people may know that you, O Y<small>HWH</small>, are God,
that you yourself have reversed their heart!"
I Kings 29:38,"And fire of Y<small>HWH</small> fell
and consumed the offering-up and the wood
and the stones and the dust,
and the water that was in the channel it licked up."
I Kings 29:39,"All the people saw,
and they fell upon their faces, and said:
Y<small>HWH</small>, he is God! Y<small>HWH</small>, he is God!"
I Kings 29:40,"Eliyyahu said to them:
Seize the prophets of Baal!
Let not one of them escape!
They seized them,
and Eliyyahu brought them down to Wadi Kishon
and slaughtered them there."
I Kings 29:41,"Then Eliyyahu said to Ah’av:
Go up, eat and drink,
for hark! Roaring showers!"
I Kings 29:42,"So Ah’av went up to eat and to drink,
while Eliyyahu went up to the top of the Carmel and crouched down to the ground
and put his face between his knees."
I Kings 29:43,"Then he said to his serving-lad:
Now go up and look in the direction of the sea.
He went up and looked, and said:
There is nothing.
He said:
Again, seven times."
I Kings 29:44,"And it was, at the seventh, that he said:
Here, a small cloud like a man’s palm is coming up from the sea!

Eliyyahu’s Flight to Sinai; Elisha Appointed: At the moment of his greatest triumph, Eliyyahu has to take to flight. God’s stunning victory over the prophets of Baal, while it wins over the hearts of the people for the moment, cannot prevent the pagan queen Izevel from forcing the prophet into a long journey. It takes place in miraculously quick fashion, and he winds up where he began in Chap. 17: alone in the wilderness, fed at divine command. But this time there is a sense of deep despair which we have not seen previously. The theme of death echoes through Eliyyahu’s multiple negative references to the Hebrew term nefesh, here meaning “life” (Fishbane). In the midst of his torment, the prophet finds himself at Sinai, in “the cave,” perhaps the site where Moshe had communed with God in Exod. 33. In one of the Bible’s greatest revelation scenes, God speaks to Eliyyahu, but not by means of the usual Sinai pyrotechnics which were so characteristic of the Exodus stories, and which in Ugaritic literature are often connected to the god Baal. Instead, after wind, earthquake, and fire, God addresses the prophet in a “still small voice.” The message is both consoling (he is to be relieved of duty, so to speak) and concentrated: he must go back into the world and set up future events, by appointing his successor and anointing not only the next king of Israel but the king of Aram as well.
The portrait of a prophet as an isolated, persecuted, and self-doubting figure is characteristic of the Hebrew Bible’s understanding of the role. Moshe begins the pattern in his initial refusal to serve (Exod. 3) and continues in the many moments when he alone stands between an angry God and the erring people. But the pattern continues elsewhere, especially in the person of Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) (see, for instance, Jer. 1 and 20). The nature of the prophet’s role is to stand against “nations and kingdoms: / to uproot and to pull down, / to destroy and to overthrow, / to build and to plant” (Jer. 1:10). Despite the terrible personal price to be paid by the prophet in his personal and communal life, however, he is exhorted, “Do not break down before them, / lest I break you before them… . They will attack you, / but they shall not overcome you; / for I am with you—declares Y<small>HWH</small>—to save you” (Jer. 1:17,19).
There is pathos in Eliyyahu’s loneliness, which stands out in contrast to his mastery of the miraculous elsewhere; the wonder-worker cannot overcome his destiny. And so it is that he finds one over whom he can literally throw his mantle, a successor (Elisha) who will surpass his master in textual space and miraculous deeds, but not in force of personality.
Go up, say to Ah’av:
Get harnessed and go down,
so that the showers do not stop you!"
I Kings 30:26,"And it was by then, by then
that the heavens became gloomy with clouds and wind,
and there were heavy showers;
so Ah’av mounted up and went to Yizre’el."
I Kings 30:27,"And the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was upon Eliyyahu:
he bound up his loins and ran ahead of Ah’av
as far as where you come to Yizre’el."
I Kings 31:1,"And Ah’av told Izevel
all that Eliyyahu had done,
and above all, that he had killed all the prophets with the sword."
I Kings 31:2,"So Izevel sent a messenger to Eliyyahu, saying:
Thus may the gods do, and thus may they add,
for by this time tomorrow I will make your life like the life of one of them!"
I Kings 31:3,"He was afraid, so he arose and went away for his life,
and he came to Be’er-Sheva that belongs to Judah,
and left his serving-lad there,"
I Kings 31:4,"while he himself went into the wilderness, a day’s journey.
He came and sat down under a broom tree,
and wished for his life to die;
he said:
Enough!
Now, O Y<small>HWH</small>,
take my life,
for I am no better than my fathers!"
I Kings 31:5,"He lay down and fell asleep under a broom tree.
And here, there was a messenger touching him!
He said to him:
Get up, eat!"
I Kings 31:6,"He looked,
and here, at his head was a cake [baked on] glowing coals, and a jug of water.
So he ate and drank, and returned to lie down."
I Kings 31:7,"And the messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> returned a second-time and touched him,

when you come [there], you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram,"
I Kings 31:16,"and Yehu son of Nimshi you are to anoint as king over Israel,
while Elisha son of Shafat, from Evel-Mehola, you are to anoint as prophet in your place.

I Kings 31:17,"<b>ran ahead of Ah’av:</b> Medieval commentators, and Cogan (2001), see this as a mark of respect for the king, with Eliyyahu acting like one of the outrunners. But it should also be noted that from Carmel to Yizre’el is a hefty run, perhaps eighteen miles. So Eliyyahu outraces the king’s chariot horses, again acting almost supernaturally (Cantrell)."
I Kings 32:1,"<b>and above all:</b> Following ancient versions; MT has “and all that,” which makes no sense."
I Kings 32:2,<b>He was afraid:</b> Ancient versions and manuscripts; MT has “he saw.” <b>Be’er-Sheva that belongs to Judah:</b> Some two hundred miles from Eliyyahu’s usual haunts in the north.
I Kings 32:3,"<b>a broom tree:</b> Others, “a single/lone broom tree,” but Heb. <i>ahat</i> may simply be the indefinite article in northern biblical speech. As for the tree, commentators differ over whether this is a different bush than the one above, or some kind of textual error."
I Kings 32:4,"<b>messenger:</b> From God; our “angel’’ is derived from Greek <i>angelos</i>, “messenger.” <b>touching:</b> Perhaps even with the nuance of “punching” (Mann) or “poking.”"
I Kings 32:5,<b>too much:</b> Or “more than enough” (Walsh).
I Kings 32:6,"<b>a cave:</b> The definite article in biblical Hebrew can often be understood as indefinite in English. Nevertheless, some take it as <i>the</i> cave of revelation to Moshe (see the “cleft of the rock” in Exod. 33:22)."
I Kings 32:7,"<b>Y<small>HWH</small> was not in the … :</b> The unusual form here seems to break out of narrative and belong almost to the realm of incantation, or at least oral performance, making the scene even more vivid. Before each phrase, virtually all translations insert “but,” which, however, is not in the text."
I Kings 32:8,"<b>a still, small voice:</b> Heb. <i>kol demama dakka.</i> Levine suggests a usage of <i>d-m-m</i> that describes mourning or the like, and Simon (1997) notes a similar meaning in ancient versions; I therefore contemplated using “a mild murmuring voice.” But the King James Version’s “a still, small voice” has never been surpassed, and retains much of the mystery and ambiguity of the Hebrew, in which the prophetic experience encompasses both awestruck silence and speech. The genius of the King James translators is also on display here, since what they inherited from their great predecessor, WilliamTyndale (whose translation informs the bulk of their text), was “a small, still voice.”"
I Kings 32:9,"<b>way:</b> Translated as “journey” in v.7. <b>the Wilderness of Damascus:</b> East of Lake Tiberias, and a region well-known as a place of refuge (Gray 1970). <b>anoint Hazael:</b> This action will actually be done by Eliyyahu’s disciple Elisha, so Eliyyahu will accomplish it only indirectly (Fishbane)."
I Kings 32:10,"<b>Elisha:</b> Pronounced <i>eh-lee-SHAH.</i> The name means “My God Delivers.” <b>Evel-Mehola:</b> Southeast of Bet-She’an, near the Jordan River. <b>anoint:</b> In the case of Elisha, some commentators see the act as indicating “appointing,” and not literally pouring oil on his head.
Ah’av/Israel and Aram: The book of Kings is highly interested in neighboring nations, as in Aram here; but typically that interest stems less from a desire to report detailed historical events and more from a need to teach about God, kings, and prophets. And so this chapter presents Ah’av as defiant of the Aramean king—a stance that is supported by God through a prophet—but he also releases the defeated Ben-Hadad following the battle, much to the chagrin of YHWH. This last is perhaps a hint of the historical record as found outside the Bible; Assyrian sources characterize Israel and Aram as close allies in the Battle of Qarqar in 853 B.C.E.
Aram covers the large area to the northeast of Israel, substantially today’s Syria. It thus became, in the early centuries of the first millennium <small>B.C.E</small>., a border or buffer state between Assyria and those peoples living on the Mediterranean coast. Aram was not destined to become a great empire like those to the east and southeast, although it attained some prominence in the ninth century; throughout much of its history it was in fact disunified, never possessing a central government. Its chief contributions to the world were, first, its adaptation of Phoenician writing into a more functional alphabet, with the innovation of several letters coming to serve as vowels; and, second, its status as the birthplace of the Aramaic language, which first served as a major diplomatic language in the ancient Near East and later became the daily tongue of Jews for well over a thousand years, including of Jesus and of the Roman-period Rabbis.
From the vantage point of narrative continuity, this chapter would be most fruitfully paired with Chap. 22, and indeed, in LXX the chapter order is 21–20–22."
I Kings 32:11,"Now it shall be: he who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Yehu will put to death,
and he who escapes from the sword of Yehu, Elisha will put to death!"
I Kings 32:12,"But I will allow seven thousand to remain in Israel—
every [one of] the knees that has not bent to Baal
and every mouth that has not kissed him!"
I Kings 32:13,"He went from there and found Elisha son of Shafat,
—now he was plowing with twelve teams [of oxen] in front of him,
while he was with the twelfth—
and Eliyyahu crossed over to him and threw his mantle over him."
I Kings 32:14,"He left the oxen and ran after Eliyyahu,
and said:
Now let me kiss my father and my mother [good-bye];
then I will go after you.
He said to him:
Go, turn back!
For what have I done to you?"
I Kings 32:15,"He turned back from [going] after him
and took a team of oxen and slaughtered it,
and in the vessel [intended] for the oxen he boiled them, the meat;
he gave it to the people and they ate it.
Then he arose and went after Eliyyahu, and attended him."
I Kings 33:1,"Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered his entire army
—thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots—
and went up and besieged Shomeron, and did battle against it."
I Kings 33:2,He sent messengers to Ah’av king of Israel in the city;
I Kings 33:3,"he said to him:
Thus says Ben-Hadad:
Your silver and your gold—it is mine,
your women and your children, the best ones—they are mine!"
I Kings 33:4,"The king of Israel answered, he said:
According to your word, my lord king:
I am yours and all that I have."
I Kings 33:5,"The messengers returned and said:
Thus says Ben-Hadad, saying:
Indeed, I sent to you, saying:
Your silver and your gold, your women and your children, to <i>me</i> you must give them!"
I Kings 33:6,"But at this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you;
they will search your house and the houses of your servants,
and it will be: everything delightful in your eyes
they will put in their hand and they will take."
I Kings 33:7,"The king of Israel called for all the elders of the land
and said:
Now know and take-note that this one is seeking evil,
for he sent to me for my women and for my children, for my silver and for my gold,
yet I kept back nothing from him!"
I Kings 33:8,"Then all the elders and all the people said to him:
Do not listen,
you must not consent!"
I Kings 33:9,"So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad:
Say to my lord king:
Every matter about which you first sent to your servant, I will do,
but this matter I am not able to do!
So the messengers went off, and returned word to him."
I Kings 33:10,"And Ben-Hadad sent to him
and said:
Thus may the gods do to me, and thus may they add,
if the dust of Shomeron suffices for handfuls for all the fighting-people who are behind me!"
I Kings 33:11,"The king of Israel answered,
he said: Speak on;
let not the one who buckles on boast like the one who strips off!"
I Kings 33:12,"Now it was, when he heard this word
—he was drinking, he and the [other] kings at Sukkot—
that he said to his servants: Set [the attack]!
So they set upon the city."
I Kings 33:13,"Now here, a prophet came close to Ah’av king of Israel, and said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
Do you see all this great throng?
Here, I am giving it into your hand today,
so that you may know that I am Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Kings 33:14,"Ah’av said:
Through whom?
He said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Through the squire-lads of the district commanders.
He said:
Who will bind up the battle-array?
He said:
You."
I Kings 33:15,"So he counted [for war] the squire-lads of the provincial commanders
—they were two hundred two and thirty—
and after them he counted all the fighting-people, all the Children of Israel: seven thousand."
I Kings 33:16,"And they went out at noon.
Now Ben-Hadad was drinking himself drunk at Sukkot,
he and the kings, thirty-two kings helping him."
I Kings 33:17,"And the squire-lads of the provincial commanders went out first;
they sent [to] Ben-Hadad
and told him, saying:
Men have gone out from Shomeron!"
I Kings 33:18,"He said:
If they have gone out for peace, seize them alive,
and if it is for battle that they have gone out, alive seize them [too]!"
I Kings 33:19,"But these went out from the city, the squires of the provincial commanders,
along with the army that was behind them;"
I Kings 33:20,"each man struck his man down,
and they fled to Aram, while Israel pursued them.
And Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse, with cavalry."
I Kings 33:21,"The king of Israel went out and struck down horse and chariot;
he struck Aram, a great striking-down."
I Kings 33:22,"And the prophet came close to the king of Israel and said to him:
Go, strengthen yourself;
know and take-note of what you must do,
for at the turn of the year, the king of Aram will go up against you."
I Kings 33:23,"Now the servants of the king of Aram said to him:
A god of the hills is their god,
therefore they were stronger than we;
but we should do battle with them in the plain
[and see] if we aren’t stronger than they!"
I Kings 33:24,"And this thing, do:
Remove the kings, each one from his place,
and put governors in their steads;"
I Kings 33:25,"while you, you are to number yourself an army
like the army fell away from you,
horse like horse, chariot like chariot,
that we may battle them in the plain,
[and see] if we aren’t stronger than they!
He hearkened to their voice, and did thus."
I Kings 33:26,"So it was, at the turn of the year,
that Ben-Hadad counted Aram [for war],
and he went up to Afek for battle with Israel,"
I Kings 33:27,"while the Children of Israel were mustered and provided [with food]
and went to meet them;
the Children of Israel encamped over against them
like two bare flocks of goats,
while Aram filled up the land."
I Kings 33:28,"And the man of God came close and said to the king of Israel, he said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Because Aram said: A god of the hills is Y<small>HWH</small>,
he is not a god of the valleys—
I will give all this great throng into your hand,
so that you may know that I am Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Kings 33:29,"They encamped, these opposite those, for seven days,
and it was on the seventh day, that the battle came near;
the Children of Israel struck down of Aram a hundred thousand foot-soldiers in one day."
I Kings 33:30,"Those left fled to Afek, to the town,
and the wall fell upon the twenty-seven thousand fighting-men who were left.
Ben-Hadad [too] had fled, and he came into the town, into a room within a room."
I Kings 33:31,"His servants said to him:
Now here, we have heard that the kings of the House of Israel—indeed, they are kings [who keep] loyalty;
now let us put sackcloth on our loins and cords on our heads,
and let us go out [to surrender] to the king of Israel
—perhaps he will spare your life.

Navot’s Vineyard: This story, which might be titled “The Framing of Navot,” appears to have been inserted in the middle of two accounts of Israel’s relationship with Aram. It has been made to connect to the first by means of an aural association: the description of Ah’av’s mood in 20:43 as “sullen and enraged” is repeated verbatim in v.4. The story is a high point in the biblical narrator’s art, and tells us more about a situation and an ideology than it does about the prophet himself. Eliyyahu’s ringing condemnation of Ah’av is a classic prophetic trope, rather removed from his usual miracle-working behavior. Indeed, structurally the story is almost a clone of the David and Bat-Sheva tale of II Sam. 11–12. In both instances, a king takes what is rightfully another’s; he has the owner murdered; as he is about to get away with the dual crime, a prophet confronts and condemns him; the king immediately repents; and aspects of the punishment are deflected or put off until the next generation. A message beyond specific historical circumstances is presented here, namely, that the king may not trespass on certain sacred rights, especially regarding the family inheritance of land. And Mann notes that the king and queen even break most of the Ten Commandments in this brief story. In a broader sense, then, the story exposes the unresolved tension between small community and monarchy, a tension which applies not only to Eliyyahu’s era but probably to an extended period of change, whenever it may have occurred historically. It is all the more ironic that Izevel makes use of the social mechanisms of small community, a council of elders and freemen, to bring about Navot’s murder.
Of particular interest are the portraits of Izevel and Ah’av painted in the text. The Phoenician princess who becomes queen of Israel is the epitome of connivance and control, more paralleling the David of the Bat-Sheva story than her husband does. Upon hearing Ah’av’s complaint, without missing a beat she uses her power to get what he cannot, as if she has a plan already drawn up. He, on the other hand, appears utterly tentative—whether out of weakness of character or respect for ancient institutions, we are not told. But when confronted by Eliyyahu, Ah’av is transformed into the model sinner, repenting even more strongly than did his predecessor David.
The chapter gives the writer the opportunity to include a Deuteronomistic note (vv.24–26) about how terrible Ah’av was, and sets up the next major section of Kings, which will recount how the Omride dynasty (and Izevel) meets its downfall. The narrative will take its time getting there; the prophecy’s fulfillment will occur only during the career of Eliyyahu’s successor Elisha. The fact that this chapter seems to be modeled on the earlier story from Samuel may indicate that the writers/editors felt so strongly about the theme of kingly usurpation that they made sure to include a separate parallel story about the north, whenever our chapter was actually written.
The narrator makes use of several key words in repetition. Five times in vv.13–16 we hear the root “die,” which hammers in the seriousness of the crime (just as both David’s murder of Uriyya and the finality of David’s punishment, the death of his newborn child, are stressed through the same root in II Sam. 11:17–24 and 12:18–19). The fourfold “take possession” later in the story turns our attention to the second stage of Ah’av’s crime. Above all, however, is the signal use of the commonplace verb “give,” occurring fully nine times in the first seven verses of the story. If the David/Bat-Sheva narrative was about “sending,” the present story is about who has the power to give over what is not theirs. And the dynasty is condemned in just those terms—v.22’s “I will give your house to be” like the other defunct dynasties of the Northern Kingdom. While the Hebrew verb <i>n-t-n</i> in such passages usually signifies “make” or “place,” here it may be meant to echo the earlier theme word “give.” The same verb can also connote “to sell,” so we have here a rich use of language."
I Kings 33:54,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins and cords on their heads
and came to the king of Israel
and said:
Your servant Ben-Hadad says:
Pray spare my life!
He said:
Is he still alive? He is my brother!"
I Kings 33:55,"Now the men were practicing divination and quickly seized upon it,
and said:
Ben-Hadad is your brother!
And he said:
Come, fetch him!
So Ben-Hadad went out to him, and he pulled him up into the chariot."
I Kings 33:56,"He said to him:
The towns that my father took from your father, I return,
and you may put bazaars in operation for yourself in Damascus,
just as my father put in operation in Shomeron;
while I, under [this] covenant I will send you free.
So he cut a covenant with him, and sent him off."
I Kings 33:57,"Now a man from the Sons of the Prophets said to his neighbor:
By the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, pray strike me!
But the man refused to strike him,"
I Kings 33:58,"so he said to him:
Because you did not hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>,
here, when you go from me, a lion will strike you down!
He went from beside him, and a lion found him and struck him down."
I Kings 33:59,"Then he found another man and said: Pray strike me!
And the man struck him, striking and wounding [him]."
I Kings 33:60,"Then the prophet went and stood [waiting] for the king, by the road,
and he disguised himself with a covering over his eyes."
I Kings 33:61,"It was, as the king was crossing by,
that he cried out to the king;
he said:
Your servant went out into the midst of the battle,
when here, a man turned aside and brought a man to me,
and he said: Guard this man—
if he is counted-missing, yes, missing [later],
it will be your life in place of his life,
or else you will have to weigh out a talent of silver!"
I Kings 33:62,"Now it was: your servant was facing here and there,
and then he was no more!
The king of Israel said to him:
Correct is your judgment: you yourself have decided."
I Kings 33:63,"Quickly he removed the covering from over his eyes,
and the king of Israel recognized him,
that he was of the prophets."
I Kings 33:64,"He said to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Because you sent free the man, one devoted-to-destruction by me, from [your] hand,
it will be your life in place of his life,
and your people in place of his people!"
I Kings 33:65,"The king of Israel went back to his house sullen and enraged;
thus he came to Shomeron."
I Kings 34:1,"Now after these events it was:
A vineyard belonged to Navot the Yizre’elite that was in Yizre’el,
next to the Great-House of Ah’av king in Shomeron."
I Kings 34:2,"And Ah’av spoke to Navot, saying:
Give me your vineyard, that it may be a garden of greens for me
—for it is nearby, next to my house—
and I will give you, in its place, a vineyard better than it;
[or] if it is better in your eyes,
I will give you silver for the price of this one."
I Kings 34:3,"But Navot said to Ah’av:
Y<small>HWH</small> forbid for me
from my giving over the inheritance of my fathers to you!"
I Kings 34:4,"Ah’av came back to his house sullen and enraged
over the word that Navot the Yizre’elite had spoken to him
when he said: I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers!
He lay down on his couch and turned away his face and would not eat food."
I Kings 34:5,"And Izevel his wife came to him
and spoke to him:
Now why is your spirit so sullen
that you do not eat food?"
I Kings 34:6,"He spoke to her:
Because I spoke to Navot the Yizre’elite;
I said to him:
Give me your vineyard for silver,
or, if you like,
I will give you a vineyard in its place—
yet he said: I will not give you my vineyard!"
I Kings 34:7,"Izevel his wife said to him:
Do <i>you</i>, now, exercise kingship over Israel?
Arise, eat food, that your heart may be in good-humor;
<i>I</i> will give you the vineyard of Navot the Yizre’elite!"
I Kings 34:8,"So she wrote letters in Ah’av’s name
and sealed [them] with his seal,
and sent the letters to the elders and the freemen who were in his town, those settled with Navot."
I Kings 34:9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying:
Proclaim a fast
and seat Navot at the head of the people;"
I Kings 34:10,"then seat two base men in front of him;
have them testify against him, saying:
You cursed God and the king!
Then bring him out and pelt him, so that he dies."
I Kings 34:11,"So they did, the men of his town
—the elders and the freemen that were settled in his town—
as Izevel had sent to them,
as was written in the letters that she had sent to them:"
I Kings 34:12,"they proclaimed a fast
and seated Navot at the head of the people,"
I Kings 34:13,"and the two base men came and sat in front of him;
the base men testified against Navot, in front of the people,
saying:
Navot cursed God and the king!
So they took him outside the town
and pelted him with stones, and he died."
I Kings 34:14,"Then they sent to Izevel, saying:
Navot has been pelted, and has died."
I Kings 34:15,"Now it was, when Izevel heard that Navot had been pelted, and had died,
that Izevel said to Ah’av:
Arise, take possession
of the vineyard of Navot the Yizre’elite
which he refused to give to you for silver,
for Navot is not alive,
for he is dead!"
I Kings 34:16,"It was, when Ah’av heard that Navot was dead,
that Ah’av arose to go down to the vineyard of Navot the Yizre’elite, to take possession of it."
I Kings 34:17,"But the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Eliyyahu the Tishbite, saying:"
I Kings 34:18,"Arise, go down
to meet Ah’av king of Israel who is in Shomeron:
here, [he is] at the vineyard of Navot,
where he has gone down to take possession of it.

I Kings 35:6,"<b>freemen:</b> A different root than the one used as “free” in v.21. Others, “nobles.”"
I Kings 35:7,<b>cursed:</b> Lit. “blessed”; ancient scribes did not wish to use the direct word for “cursed” in reference to God. The same construction occurs in the first two chapters of Job. <b>pelt him:</b> With stones.
I Kings 35:8,"<b>pelted him:</b> The mention of the incident in II Kings 9:25-26 includes Navot’s sons as well, thus solving Ah’av’s problem of heirs surviving to claim the property."
I Kings 35:9,"<b>meet:</b> Or “confront.”
War with Aram and the Death of Ah’av: In an earlier stage of the development of Kings, this chapter undoubtedly followed Chap. 20. In addition, the use of the term “king of Israel” instead of “Ah’av” or “King Ah’av” has led some scholars to theorize that the figure described here originally referred to another monarch. This is further supported by v.40’s description of Ah’av’s death in normal terms, as opposed to his falling in battle.
In our discussion of the structure of Kings above (p. 551), we noted that this section of the book is concerned with the relationship between kings and prophets. Chap. 22 introduces a whole new cast of the latter, both in plural and in singular, and poses a question that is raised a number of times in the Bible: How does one know if a prophet is a “true” one or a false one? The Judahite king Yehoshafat’s initial query about the outcome of the imminent battle meets with enthusiastic predictions from a large group of professional prophets, but their answer somehow does not satisfy the king; perhaps he understands their function as “yes men.” He summons instead a prophet known to be contrary—not Eliyyahu, but a certain Mikhayhu—who proceeds first to lie, but finally reveals that Ah’av will die in the battle. The result of this revelation is Mikhayhu’s receiving a slap from one of the onlooking court prophets, and then his imprisonment.
In the second part of the chapter (vv.29ff.), Ah’av meets his fate. Despite a desperate attempt to outwit the enemy by discarding his royal garb while encouraging his Judahite ally not to do so, he is hit by an Aramean arrow. Propped up in the chariot in the heat of the battle, he bleeds to death.
The Ah’av who may be teased from history appears to have been more accomplished than the Bible gives him credit for. While the text hints at some building projects (v.39), archaeology credits him with more, including probably the so-called stables at Megiddo. Of equal significance is the fact that he was a participant in the important battle at Qarqar, where the burgeoning Assyrian Empire apparently suffered a temporary setback. For the book of Kings, however, the account of Navot’s framing is of much greater import, and there is no hint there of Qarqar, in an excellent example of the Bible’s attitude toward what we call history. Thus Ah’av is judged by standards other than political ones, and, regardless of his actual accomplishments, he has been effectively frozen for all time as the Baal-tolerating king of Israel, Izevel’s husband, and Eliyyahu’s opponent. It is intriguing, but not entirely unexpected, that Melville appropriated his name for the captain of the <i>Pequod</i>, who makes a virtual idol of his desire for revenge."
I Kings 35:10,"You are to speak to him, saying:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Murdered have you, and dispossessed too?
And you are to speak to him, saying:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
In the place where the dogs have licked up the blood of Navot
the dogs will lick up your blood, even yours!"
I Kings 35:11,"Ah’av said to Eliyyahu:
Have you found me, my enemy?
He said:
I have found [you]!
Because you have sold yourself
to do what is evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Kings 35:12,"here, I will bring evil upon you
and will eradicate [those coming] after you
and will cut off from Ah’av he who pisses against the wall,
[even] the fettered and forsaken in Israel!"
I Kings 35:13,"I will give your house to be
like the House of Yorov’am son of Nevat,
like the House of Ba’sha son of Ahiyya,
because of the provocation by which you have provoked [me]
and caused Israel to sin."
I Kings 35:14,"And also about Izevel Y<small>HWH</small> has spoken, saying:
The dogs will eat Izevel
at the rampart of Yizre’el!"
I Kings 35:15,"He who dies of Ah’av in the town
the dogs shall eat,
while he who dies in the open-field
the birds of the heavens shall eat!"
I Kings 35:16,"—Surely there was never [another] like Ah’av,
who sold himself to do what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
whom Izevel his wife incited;"
I Kings 35:17,"he did exceedingly abominably in walking after the Illicit-Things,
exactly as the Amorites had done,
whom Y<small>HWH</small> had dispossessed before the Children of Israel.—"
I Kings 35:18,"Now it was, when Ah’av heard these words,
that he tore his garments and put sackcloth upon his flesh
and fasted,
and lay down in sackcloth,
and went around softly."
I Kings 35:19,"And the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Eliyyahu the Tishbite, saying:"
I Kings 35:20,"Do you see that Ah’av is humbling himself before me?
Because he is humbling himself before me,
I will not bring the evil in his days;
in the days of his son I will bring the evil on his house."
I Kings 36:1,"They stayed put for three years,
[since] there was no war between Aram and Israel."
I Kings 36:2,"But it was in the third year
that Yehoshafat king of Judah went down to the king of Israel."
I Kings 36:3,"The king of Israel said to his servants:
Do you know that Ramot-Gil’ad is ours?
Yet we keep silent about taking it from the king of Aram!"
I Kings 36:4,"So he said to Yehoshafat:
Will you go with me in battle to Ramot-Gil’ad?
Yehoshafat said to the king of Israel:
I am as you are: my fighting-people as your fighting-people, my horses as your horses!"
I Kings 36:5,"And Yehoshafat said to the king of Israel:
Pray inquire of the word of Y<small>HWH</small> here-and-now."
I Kings 36:6,"So the king of Israel gathered the prophets, some four hundred men,
and said to them:
Shall I go against Ramot-Gil’ad in battle, or shall I refrain?
They said:
Go up—Y<small>HWH</small> will give it into the hand of the king!"
I Kings 36:7,"Yehoshafat said:
Is there not a prophet of Y<small>HWH</small> here, yet another, that we may inquire through him?"
I Kings 36:8,"The king of Israel said to Yehoshafat:
There is yet another man through whom one may inquire of Y<small>HWH</small>,
but I myself hate him,
for he never prophesies for good concerning me, but only for evil:
Mikhayhu son of Yimla.
Yehoshafat said:
Let not the king say thus!"
I Kings 36:9,"So the king of Israel called an officer and said:
Quickly! Mikhayhu son of Yimla!"
I Kings 36:10,"Now the king of Israel and Yehoshafat king of Judah were sitting, each one on his throne
clothed in [royal] garments,
at the threshing floor at the entrance to the Gate of Shomeron,
while all the prophets were prophesying before them."
I Kings 36:11,"And Tzidkiyya son of Kenaana made himself horns of iron
and said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
With these you shall gore Aram, until they are finished off!"
I Kings 36:12,"And all the prophets prophesied thus, saying:
Go up to Ramot-Gil’ad, and triumph,
for Y<small>HWH</small> will give [it] into the hand of the king!"
I Kings 36:13,"Then the messenger who had gone to call Mikhayhu spoke to him, saying:
Now here, the words of the prophets are as one mouth for good regarding the king;
pray may your word be like the word of one of them, so that you speak for good!"
I Kings 36:14,"But Mikhayhu said:
As Y<small>HWH</small> lives!
Indeed, whatever Y<small>HWH</small> says to me, that [alone] may I speak."
I Kings 36:15,"He came to the king, and the king said to him:
Mikhayhu, shall we go to Ramot-Gil’ad in battle,
or shall we refrain?
He said to him:
Go up and triumph;
Y<small>HWH</small> will give it into the hand of the king."
I Kings 36:16,"The king said to him:
How many times must I make you swear
that you are not to speak to me anything but truth in the name of Y<small>HWH?</small>"
I Kings 36:17,"So he said:
I saw all Israel scattered on the hills
like sheep that have no herder,
and Y<small>HWH</small> said: There are no masters for these.
Let each return to his house in peace!"
I Kings 36:18,"The king of Israel said to Yehoshafat:
Did I not say to you:
He never prophesies for good concerning me, but only for evil?"
I Kings 36:19,"He said:
Therefore, hearken to the word of Y<small>HWH:</small>
I saw Y<small>HWH</small> sitting on his throne,
with all the Forces of the Heavens standing over against him, on his right and on his left;"
I Kings 36:20,"and Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Who will entice Ah’av
so that he will go up and fall at Ramot-Gil’ad?
And this one said thusly, while that one said thusly."
I Kings 36:21,"Then a spirit came out and stood in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
and said:
<i>I</i> will entice him.
Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
In what [way]?"
I Kings 36:22,"He said:
I will go out and be a false spirit
in the mouth of all his prophets.
He said:
You will entice [him], aye, you will prevail.
Go out and do thus!"
I Kings 36:23,"So-now, here: Y<small>HWH</small> has placed a false spirit
in the mouth of all these your prophets,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has spoken evil regarding you!"
I Kings 36:24,"Then Tzidkiyyahu son of Kenaana approached and struck Mikhayhu on the cheek,
and said:
Which way did the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> cross over from me to speak with you?"
I Kings 36:25,"Mikhayhu said:
Here, you will see on that day,
when you enter a room within a room to hide!"
I Kings 36:26,"The king of Israel said:
Take Mikhayhu
and turn him over to Amon, commander of the town, and to Yoash, the son of the king;"
I Kings 36:27,"you are to say:
Thus says the king:
Put this one in the prison house and have him eat meager bread and meager water,
until I return in peace."
I Kings 36:28,"Mikhayhu said:
If you return, yes, return in peace,
Y<small>HWH</small> has not spoken through me!
And he said:
Hearken, O peoples, all of them …"
I Kings 36:29,The king of Israel and Yehoshafat king of Judah went up to Ramot-Gil’ad.
I Kings 36:30,"And the king of Israel said to Yehoshafat:
[I] will disguise [myself] and come to battle,
but you, clothe yourself in your [royal] garments.
So the king of Israel disguised himself and came to battle."
I Kings 36:31,"Now the king of Aram had charged the chariot officers belonging to him,
thirty-two, saying:
You are not to engage in battle with anyone from small to great,
except with the king of Israel alone!"
I Kings 36:32,"And it was, when the chariot officers saw Yehoshafat,
that they said:
Surely he is the king of Israel!
So they turned toward him, to do battle,
and Yehoshafat cried out [for help]."
I Kings 36:33,"But it was, when the chariot officers saw that he was not the king of Israel,
that they turned away from him."
I Kings 36:34,"Now a man drew his bow in his innocence
and struck the king of Israel between the connecting-plates and the armor.
He said to his chariot driver:
Reverse your hand and take me out of the camp,
for I have been wounded!"
I Kings 36:35,"The battle heightened on that day,
and the king was stood up in the chariot, facing Aram.
He died at sunset, with the blood of his wound pouring into the lap of the chariot."
I Kings 36:36,"And a ringing-cry passed through the camp as the sun was coming in, saying:
Each one to his town! Each one to his land!"
I Kings 36:37,"So the king died and was brought to Shomeron,
and they buried the king in Shomeron."
I Kings 36:38,"The chariot was rinsed off by the Pool of Shomeron;
the dogs licked up his blood,
and whores bathed [in it],
according to the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had spoken."
I Kings 36:39,"Now the rest of the events of Ah’av, and all that he did,
and the house of ivory that he built
and all the towns that he built—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
I Kings 36:40,"Ah’av lay beside his fathers,
and Ahazyahu his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 36:41,"Now Yehoshafat son of Asa became king over Judah
in year four of Ah’av king of Israel."
I Kings 36:42,"Yehoshafat was thirty-five years old at his becoming king,
and for twenty-five years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Azuva daughter of Shilhi."
I Kings 36:43,"And he walked in all the way of Asa his father;
he did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 36:44,"However, the sanctuaries were not removed—
the people were still offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke at the sanctuaries."
I Kings 36:45,And Yehoshafat made peace with the king of Israel.
I Kings 36:46,"Now the rest of the events of Yehoshafat and his mighty-deeds that he did, and how he waged battle—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
I Kings 36:47,"And the rest of the [male] prostitutes who were left in the days of Asa his father
he eradicated from the land."
I Kings 36:48,"Now king there was none in Edom;
a prefect reigned as king."
I Kings 36:49,"And Yehoshafat had made ships of Tarshish for going to Ofir, for gold,
but they did not go,
because the ships broke apart at Etzyon-Gever."
I Kings 36:50,"It was then that Ahazyahu son of Ah’av had said to Yehoshafat:
Let my servants go with your servants aboard the ships!
But Yehoshafat had not consented."
I Kings 36:51,"Yehoshafat lay beside his fathers;
he was buried with his fathers
in the city of David his father,
and Yehoram his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 36:52,"Ahazyahu son of Ah’av became king over Israel in Shomeron
in year seventeen of Yehoshafat king of Judah;
he reigned as king over Israel for two years."
I Kings 36:53,"And he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH:</small>
he walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother,
and in the way of Yorov’am son of Nevat,
who had caused Israel to sin;"
I Kings 36:54,"he served Baal and bowed down to him
and provoked Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel,
exactly as his father had done.
