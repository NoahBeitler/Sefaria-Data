I Kings 1:1,"Now King David was old, advanced in days,
and they covered him with garments, but he could not get warm."
I Kings 1:2,"So his servants said to him:
Let them seek for my lord king a nubile girl,
that she may stand [in waiting] before the king
and be a caregiver for him;
she will lie in your bosom, and my lord king will be warm."
I Kings 1:3,"So they sought out a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel,
and they found Avishag the Shunammite
and brought her to the king."
I Kings 1:4,"Now the girl was beautiful, exceedingly so;
she became a caregiver for the king, and attended him,
but the king did not know her."
I Kings 1:5,"Meanwhile, Adoniyya son of Haggit was exalting himself, saying:
<i>I</i> will be king!
And he provided himself with chariotry and steeds,
with fifty men running ahead of him."
I Kings 1:6,"Now his father had never scolded him in [all] his days, saying:
For-what-reason did you do thus?
And he was also exceedingly goodly in form;
it was he to whom she gave birth after Avshalom."
I Kings 1:7,"Now his [private] words were with Yoav son of Tzeruya, and with Evyatar the priest;
they provided help [to follow] after Adoniyya,"
I Kings 1:8,"while Tzadok the priest and Benayahu son of Yehoyada and Natan
the prophet and Shim’i and Re’i and the mighty-men who
belonged to David
were not with Adoniyyahu."
I Kings 1:9,"And Adoniyyahu sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings
beside Even Ha-Zohelet/The Serpent Stone that is near En-Rogel,
and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons,
and all the men of Judah, the king’s court-servants,"
I Kings 1:10,but Natan the prophet and Benayahu and the mighty-men and Shelomo his brother he did not invite.
I Kings 1:11,"So Natan said to Bat-Sheva mother of Shelomo, saying:
Have you not heard that Adoniyyahu son of Haggit has become king,
while our lord David does not know?"
I Kings 1:12,"So-now,
go, pray let me advise you with some advice:
save your life and the life of your son Shelomo!"
I Kings 1:13,"Come, go to King David and say to him:
Did not you yourself, my lord king, swear to your handmaid, saying:
Indeed, Shelomo your son will reign as king after me,
<i>he</i> will sit on my throne?
So for-what-reason has Adoniyyahu become king?"
I Kings 1:14,"Here,
[while] you are still speaking there with the king,
I myself will come in after you
and will confirm your words."
I Kings 1:15,"So Bat-Sheva came to the king, into the [inner] room
—now the king was exceedingly old, and Avishag the Shunammite was attending the king—"
I Kings 1:16,"and Bat-Sheva prostrated herself, and bowed low to the king,
and the king said: What is your [business]?"
I Kings 1:17,"She said to him:
My lord, you yourself swore by Y<small>HWH</small> your God to your handmaid:
indeed, Shelomo your son will reign as king after me,
<i>he</i> will sit on my throne!"
I Kings 1:18,"But now,
here, Adoniyyahu has become king,
yet you, my lord king, you do not know!"
I Kings 1:19,"He sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
and invited all the king’s sons, and Evyatar the priest,
and Yoav Commander of the Armed-Forces,
but Shelomo your servant he did not invite."
I Kings 1:20,"As for you, my lord king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you,
to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord king after him!"
I Kings 1:21,"Else it will be,
when my lord king lies beside his fathers,
that I and my son Shelomo will be guilty ones!"
I Kings 1:22,"Now here, while she was still speaking with the king,
Natan the prophet came,"
I Kings 1:23,"and they told the king, saying:
Here is Natan the prophet!
He came before the king and bowed low to the king, on his nostrils to the earth,"
I Kings 1:24,"and Natan said: My lord king,
<i>you</i> must have said: Adoniyyahu will reign as king after me,
<i>he</i> will sit on my throne!—"
I Kings 1:25,"for he went down today
and sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
and invited all the king’s sons and army commanders and Evyatar the priest—
now here, they are eating and drinking before him,
and they said: May King Adoniyyahu live!"
I Kings 1:26,"But as for me, myself your servant
and Tzadok the priest and Benayahu son of Yehoyada and Shelomo your servant he did not invite."
I Kings 1:27,"Is it from my lord king that this matter has come,
while you have not made known to your servant
who will sit on my lord’s throne after him?"
I Kings 1:28,"King David answered and said:
Call Bat-Sheva to me!
She came before the king and stood before the king,"
I Kings 1:29,"and the king swore and said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, who has redeemed my life from every trouble:"
I Kings 1:30,"indeed, as I swore to you by Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, saying:
indeed, Shelomo your son will be king after me,
<i>he</i> will sit on my throne in my place—
indeed, thus will I do this very day!"
I Kings 1:31,"And Bat-Sheva prostrated herself, nostrils to the earth, and bowed low to the king,
and said:
May my lord King David live, forever!"
I Kings 1:32,"King David said:
Call to me Tzadok the priest and Natan the prophet and Benayahu son of Yehoyada!
They came before the king."
I Kings 1:33,"And the king said to them:
Take your lord’s servants with you
and have Shelomo my son mount the mule that belongs to me,
and bring him down to the Gihon;"
I Kings 1:34,"Tzadok the priest is to anoint him there, along with Natan the prophet,
as king over Israel.
Then you are to sound-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>
and are to say: May King Shelomo live!"
I Kings 1:35,"You are to go up after him,
and he is to come in and sit on my throne;
<i>he</i> will be king in my place,
<i>him</i> I have charged to be <i>Nagid</i> over Israel and over Judah!"
I Kings 1:36,"And Benayahu son of Yehoyada answered the king and said: Amen!
So may Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of my lord king, declare!"
I Kings 1:37,"As Y<small>HWH</small> has been with my lord king,
so may he be with Shelomo,
and he may make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!"
I Kings 1:38,"So he went down, Tzadok the priest, with Natan the prophet and Benayahu son of Yehoyada,
and the Kereitites and the Peleitites;
they had Shelomo mount the mule of King David
and brought him to the Gihon."
I Kings 1:39,"Then Tzadok the priest took a horn of oil from the Tent
and anointed Shelomo,
and they sounded-a-blast on the <i>shofar</i>;
and all the people said:
May King Shelomo live!"
I Kings 1:40,"And all the people went up after him;
the people were piping on pipes and rejoicing with great joy,
so that the earth split at their sound."
I Kings 1:41,"Y<small>HWH</small>: As explained above in “On Using This Book,” the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, whose pronunciation is not precisely known, is traditionally transcribed as “the Lord” and the like. Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it (for example, “The Eternal,” <i>“Adonai”</i>)."
I Kings 1:42,"Adoniyyahu heard it, and all those invited who were with him
—now they had just finished eating—
and [when] Yoav heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i>,
he said:
For-what-reason is the sound of the city [one of] panic?"
I Kings 1:43,"He was still speaking,
when here: Yonatan son of Evyatar the priest came.
Adoniyyahu said: Come in!
For you are a man of valor,
and you bring good news."
I Kings 1:44,"Yonatan spoke up and said to Adoniyyahu:
But—our lord King David has made Shelomo king!"
I Kings 1:45,"The king sent with him Tzadok the priest and Natan the prophet and Benayahu son of Yehoyada,
and the Kereitites and the Peleitites,
and they had him mount the king’s mule,"
I Kings 1:46,"and Tzadok the priest and Natan the prophet anointed him as king at the Gihon;
they went up from there rejoicing,
and the city was [as in a] panic!
That is the sound that you heard."
I Kings 1:47,"And even more, Shelomo is seated on the throne of the kingdom,"
I Kings 1:48,"and even more, the king’s servants have come to bless our lord King David, saying:
May your God make Shelomo’s name better than your name,
may he make his throne greater than your throne!
And the king bowed low on the couch."
I Kings 1:49,"And even more, thus did the king say:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
who has given [one] today to sit on my throne, and my eyes see it!"
I Kings 1:50,"Then they trembled and arose, all those invited who were for Adoniyyahu,
and each one went on his way."
I Kings 1:51,"And Adoniyyahu was in fear before Shelomo,
so he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the sacrificialaltar."
I Kings 1:52,"And it was told to Shelomo, saying:
Here, Adoniyyahu is in fear of King Shelomo,
and here, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying:
Let King Shelomo swear to me this [very] day that he will not put his servant to death by the sword!"
I Kings 1:53,"So Shelomo said:
If he behaves like a valiant one,
not a hair of his will fall to the ground;
but if any evil be found in him, then he shall die!"
I Kings 1:54,"King Shelomo sent, and they brought him down from the altar;
he came and bowed low to King Shelomo,
and Shelomo said to him:
Go back to your house!"
I Kings 2:1,"Now David’s days drew near to die,
so he charged Shelomo his son, saying:"
I Kings 2:2,"I am about to go the way of all the earth.
You are to be strong, and be a man!"
I Kings 2:3,"You are to keep the keeping of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
walking in his ways, keeping his laws, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies,
as it is written in the Instruction of Moshe,
in order that you may cause to prosper all that you do
and wherever you face,"
I Kings 2:4,"in order that Y<small>HWH</small> may fulfill his word that he spoke to me, saying:
If your sons will guard their way,
walking in my presence in truth,
with all their heart and with all their being,
no one will [ever] be cut off from you from the throne of Israel."
I Kings 2:5,"Now even more, you yourself know what Yoav son of Tzeruya did to me,
what he did to the two commanders of the armed-forces of Israel,
to Avner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Yeter—he killed them,
and he brought the blood of war into peacetime:
he put the blood of war on his belt that is on his loins and on his sandal that is on his feet."
I Kings 2:6,"So you are to act according to your worldly-wisdom:
you must not let his gray-hair go down in peace to Sheol!"
I Kings 2:7,"But to the sons of Barzillai the Gil’adite you are to show loyalty;
they should be among those eating at your table,
for thus they came near to me [in friendship] when I ran away from Avshalom your brother."
I Kings 2:8,"And here, with you is Shim’i son of Gera, the Binyaminite from Bahurim:
<i>he</i> cursed me with a grievous curse on the day of my going to Mahanayim.
But when <i>he</i> went down to meet me at the Jordan,
I swore to him by Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
If I should put you to death by the sword … !"
I Kings 2:9,"But now, do not hold him clear,
for you are a worldly-wise man:
you know what you must do to him,
so that you bring down his gray-hair in blood to Sheol!"
I Kings 2:10,"And David lay beside his fathers,
and was buried in the City of David."
I Kings 2:11,"Now the days that David reigned as king over Israel were forty years:
in Hevron he reigned as king for seven years, while in Jerusalem he reigned as king for thirty-three years."
I Kings 2:12,"And Shelomo sat on the throne of David his father,
and his kingdom was exceedingly firmly-established."
I Kings 2:13,"Adoniyyahu son of Haggit came to Bat-Sheva mother of Shelomo.
She said:
Is your coming in peace?
He said:
In peace."
I Kings 2:14,"And he said:
I have a word for you.
She said: Speak!"
I Kings 2:15,"He said:
You yourself know that mine was the kingdom,
and that toward me all Israel had set their faces to be king.
But the kingdom has been reversed and has become my brother’s,
since it was from Y<small>HWH</small> that it became his."
I Kings 2:16,"So-now,
there is one request that I request of you—
do not turn away my face!
She said to him: Speak!"
I Kings 2:17,"He said:
Pray talk to Shelomo the king
—for he will not turn away your face—
that he may give me Avishag the Shunammite as a wife."
I Kings 2:18,"Bat-Sheva said: Very well,
I myself will speak regarding you to the king."
I Kings 2:19,"So Bat-Sheva came to King Shelomo, to speak to him regarding Adoniyyahu.
And the king arose to meet her, and bowed low to her;
then he sat down on his throne,
and he prepared a throne for the king’s mother, and she sat down at his right."
I Kings 2:20,"She said:
There is one small request that I request of you;
do not turn away my face.
The king said to her:
Make request, mother,
for I will not turn away your face."
I Kings 2:21,"She said:
Let Avishag the Shunammite be given to Adoniyyahu your brother as a wife."
I Kings 2:22,"King Shelomo answered and said to his mother:
Now why are you requesting Avishag the Shunammite for Adoniyyahu?
Request the kingdom [itself] for him,
for he is my brother, the one older than I!
—for him and for Evyatar the priest and for Yoav son of Tzeruya!"
I Kings 2:23,"And King Shelomo swore by Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add:
indeed, at [the cost of] his life has Adoniyyahu spoken this word!"
I Kings 2:24,"So-now, Y<small>HWH</small>, who has established-me-firmly and seated me on the throne of David my father,
and who has made me a [dynastic] house, as he promised:
indeed, today Adoniyyahu will be put to death!"
I Kings 2:25,"So King Shelomo sent by the hand of Benayahu son of Yehoyada;
he attacked him, so that he died."
I Kings 2:26,"Now to Evyatar the priest, the king said:
To Anatot, go to your fields!
For you are a man [deserving] of death,
but on this day I will not put you to death,
since you carried the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> before my father David,
and since you suffered all that my father suffered."
I Kings 2:27,"So Shelomo drove out Evyatar from being priest to Y<small>HWH</small>,
so as to fulfill the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had spoken regarding the House of Eli at Shilo."
I Kings 2:28,"Now the report came to Yoav
—since Yoav had inclined after Adoniyya, though after Avshalom he had not inclined—
and Yoav fled to the Tent of Y<small>HWH</small> and took hold of the horns of the altar."
I Kings 2:29,"King Shelomo was told that Yoav had fled to the Tent of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and here: he was next to the altar,
so Shelomo sent Benayahu son of Yehoyada, saying:
Go, attack him!"
I Kings 2:30,"Benayahu came to the Tent of Y<small>HWH</small>
and said to him:
Thus says the king:
Come out!
He said:
No, for here I will die!
Benayahu returned word to the king, saying:
Thus spoke Yoav, and thus he answered me."
I Kings 2:31,"The king said to him:
Do as he spoke—
attack him and then bury him,
so that you may remove the causeless blood that Yoav shed
from me and from my Father’s House."
I Kings 2:32,"May Y<small>HWH</small> return his blood on his head—
[seeing] that he attacked two men more righteous and noble than he, and killed them with the sword,
while my father David did not know:
Avner son of Ner, Commander of the Armed-Forces of Israel,
and Amasa son of Yeter, Commander of the Armed-Forces of Judah."
I Kings 2:33,"Their bloodguilt will return on the head of Yoav and on the head of his seed, into the ages,
while for David, and for his seed, and for his house, and for his throne, there will be peace for the ages from Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Kings 2:34,"So Benayahu son of Yehoyada went up and attacked him, and put him to death;
he was buried in his house in the wilderness."
I Kings 2:35,"And the king put Benayahu son of Yehoyada in his place as [The One] Over the Armed-Forces,
while Tzadok the priest, the king put in place of Evyatar."
I Kings 2:36,"Then the king sent and summoned Shim’i
and said to him:
Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and stay there;
you are not to go out of there, [either] here or there."
I Kings 2:37,"For it will be, on the day of your going out and crossing Wadi Kidron:
know, yes, know that you will die, yes, die—
your blood will be on your [own] head!"
I Kings 2:38,"Shim’i said to the king:
The word is good;
as my lord king has spoken, thus will your servant do.
And Shim’i stayed in Jerusalem for many days."
I Kings 2:39,"But it was at the end of three years
that two of Shim’i’s servants ran off to Akhish son of Maakha, king of Gat,
and they told Shim’i, saying:
Here, your servants are at Gat!"
I Kings 2:40,"So Shim’i arose and saddled his donkey and went to Gat, to Akhish,
to seek his servants.
And Shim’i went and brought back his servants from Gat."
I Kings 2:41,"Shelomo was told that Shim’i had gone from Jerusalem to Gat, and had returned,"
I Kings 2:42,"so the king sent and called for Shim’i;
he said to him:
Did I not have you swear by Y<small>HWH</small>
—and I warned you—saying:
On the day of your going out, if you should go [either] here or there,
know, yes, know that you will die, yes, die!?
And you said to me:
The word is good—I hearken."
I Kings 2:43,"So why did you not keep the sworn-oath of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and the command that I commanded you?"
I Kings 2:44,"And the king said to Shim’i:
<i>You</i> know all the evildoing that your heart knew,
that you did to David my father.
So Y<small>HWH</small> will return your evildoing on your head!"
I Kings 2:45,"But King Shelomo is blessed,
and the throne of King David will be firmly-established before Y<small>HWH</small> for the ages!"
I Kings 2:46,"So the king commanded Benayahu son of Yehoyada,
and he went out and attacked him, so that he died.
And the kingdom was firmly-established in Shelomo’s hand."
I Kings 3:1,"Shelomo became the son-in-law of Pharaoh of Egypt:
he took Pharaoh’s daughter [in marriage], and brought her to the City of David,
until he had finished building his house, and the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, and the wall of Jerusalem, all around."
I Kings 3:2,"However, the people were sacrificing at the sanctuaries,
since no house had been built for the name of Y<small>HWH</small> up until those days."
I Kings 3:3,"And Shelomo loved Y<small>HWH</small>,
walking in the practices of David his father;
however, at the sanctuaries he was offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke."
I Kings 3:4,"And the king went to Giv’on, to sacrifice there,
for it was the great sanctuary;
a thousand offerings-up would Shelomo offer up on that altar."
I Kings 3:5,"At Giv’on, Y<small>HWH</small> appeared to Shelomo in a dream of the night.
God said:
Make request: What shall I give you?"
I Kings 3:6,"Shelomo said:
You yourself have shown great loyalty to your servant, David my father,
as he walked before you in truth and in equity and in rightness of heart beside you,
and you have kept this great loyalty toward him, by giving him a son to sit on his throne, as is this day."
I Kings 3:7,"So-now, Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
you yourself have made your servant king in place of David my father,
but I am a young lad—
I do not know how to go out and to come in!"
I Kings 3:8,"And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen,
a people so many that it cannot be measured and cannot be numbered in abundance."
I Kings 3:9,"So give your servant an understanding heart
to judge your people, to discern between good and evil.
For who is able to judge this your weighty people?"
I Kings 3:10,"The word was good in the eyes of the Lord,
that Shelomo had requested this thing;"
I Kings 3:11,"God said to him:
Because you requested this thing
and did not request for yourself many days
and did not request for yourself riches
and did not request the life of your enemies,
but requested for yourself discernment to understand justice,"
I Kings 3:12,"here, I have done according to your words—
here, I am giving you a wise and discerning heart,
such that like you, none has been before you
and after you, none will arise like you."
I Kings 3:13,"And even what you did not request, I give you:
even riches, even honor,
such as none has been like you, as a man among kings, for all your days."
I Kings 3:14,"And if you walk in my ways, keeping my laws and my commandments,
as David your father walked,
I will prolong your days."
I Kings 3:15,"Shelomo awoke, and here: [It was] a dream!
He came to Jerusalem and stood before the Coffer of the Lord’s Covenant
and offered up offerings-up, and performed shalom-offerings,
and made a drinkfest for all his servants."
I Kings 3:16,"Then two whore women came to the king
and stood before him."
I Kings 3:17,"The one woman said:
Please, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house,
and I gave birth alongside her in the house."
I Kings 3:18,"And it was, on the third day after my giving birth,
that also this woman gave birth
—now we were together, there was no outsider with us in the house,
only the two of us in the house."
I Kings 3:19,"And this woman’s son died at night,
[seeing] that she had lain upon him,"
I Kings 3:20,"so she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from next to me
while your handmaid was sleeping,
and laid him in her bosom,
while her son, the dead one, she laid in my bosom."
I Kings 3:21,"I arose at daybreak to nurse my son,
and here: he was dead!
But when I examined him at daybreak,
now here, he was not my son whom I had borne!"
I Kings 3:22,"The other woman said:
No—indeed,
my son is the living one, and your son is the dead one!
And this one was saying:
No—indeed,
your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one!
Thus they spoke before the king."
I Kings 3:23,"The king said:
This one says: This is my son, the living one, and your son is the dead one;
while this one says: No—indeed,
your son is the dead one, and mine is the living one!"
I Kings 3:24,"So the king said:
Fetch me a sword!
And they brought a sword before the king."
I Kings 3:25,"And the king said:
Cut the living child in two
and give half to the one and half to the [other] one!"
I Kings 3:26,"Then said the woman whose son was the living one to the king
—for her insides burned for her son—
she said:
Please, my lord, give her the living newborn,
but death, don’t put him to death!
But this one was saying:
Not mine and not yours will he be;
cut [him] up!"
I Kings 3:27,"The king spoke up and said:
Give her the living newborn;
but death, do not put him to death—
she is his mother!"
I Kings 3:28,"And all Israel heard the judgment that the king had pronounced-as-judgment,
and they were in awe of the king,
for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to execute justice."
I Kings 4:1,King Shelomo was king over all Israel.
I Kings 4:2,"And these were the ministers whom he had:
Azaryahu son of Tzadok the Priest,"
I Kings 4:3,"Elihoref and Ahiyya sons of Shisha, [royal] Scribes,
Yehoshafat son of Ahilud, the Herald,"
I Kings 4:4,"and Benayahu son of Yehoyada, [The One] Over the Armed-Forces,
and Tzadok and Evyatar, priests,"
I Kings 4:5,"and Azaryahu son of Natan, [The One] Over the Prefects,
and Zavud son of Natan the priest, Friend of the King,"
I Kings 4:6,"and Ahishar, [The One] Over the Household,
and Adoniram son of Avda, [The One] Over the Labor-Gangs."
I Kings 4:7,"Now Shelomo had twelve prefects over all Israel.
They provided for the king and for his household;
for a month of the year it would be each one’s duty to provide."
I Kings 4:8,"And these were their names:
Son of Hur: in the highlands of Efrayim,"
I Kings 4:9,"Son of Deker: in Makatz, in Shaalvim, in Bet-Shemesh and Elon Bet-Hanan,"
I Kings 4:10,"Son of Hesed: in Arubbot
—his [responsibility] was Sokho and all the region of Heyfer,"
I Kings 4:11,"Son of Avinadav: all Nafat-Dor
—Tafat daughter of Shelomo was his wife—"
I Kings 4:12,"Baana son of Ahilud: in Ta’nakh and Megiddo, and in all of Bet-She’an that is near Tzaretan, below Yizre’el,
from Bet-She’an to Avel-Mehola, to [the region] across from Yokmo’am,"
I Kings 4:13,"Ben-Gever: in the Heights of Gil’ad
—his were the Villages of Ya’ir son of Menashe, that were in Gil’ad—
his was Hevel Argov that is in Bashan,
sixty large towns, [each with] a wall and a bronze bar,"
I Kings 4:14,"Ahinadav son of Iddo: Mahanayim,"
I Kings 4:15,"Ahimaatz: in Naftali
—he too took Bas’mat daughter of Shelomo as a wife—"
I Kings 4:16,"Baana son of Hushai: in Asher and in Alot,"
I Kings 4:17,"Yehoshafat son of Paruah: in Yissakhar,"
I Kings 4:18,"Shim’i son of Ela: in Binyamin,"
I Kings 4:19,"Gever son of Uri in the land of Gil’ad, the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan,
and one prefect who was in the land of …"
I Kings 4:20,"Judah and Israel were abundant [in number],
like the sand that is by the sea in abundance,
eating and drinking and rejoicing."
I Kings 5:1,"Now Shelomo was ruling over all the kingdoms
from the River [to] the land of the Philistines, to the border of Egypt;
they were bringing tribute-gifts and were subservient to Shelomo all the days of his life."
I Kings 5:2,"And Shelomo’s food for a single day was:
thirty <i>cors</i> of flour and sixty <i>cors</i> of meal,"
I Kings 5:3,"ten fattened cattle, twenty pastured cattle, and a hundred sheep,
aside from gazelles and deer, roebucks, and well-fed geese."
I Kings 5:4,"For he had dominion over all [the land] Across the River,
from Tifsah to Gaza,
over all the kings Across the River,
and peace was on his every side, round about."
I Kings 5:5,"So Judah and Israel dwelt in security,
each one beneath his vine and beneath his fig tree,
from Dan to Be’er-Sheva,
all the days of Shelomo."
I Kings 5:6,"Now Shelomo had four thousand stalls of horses for his chariotry
and twelve thousand steeds."
I Kings 5:7,"And these prefects provided for King Shelomo and for all those who came near the table of King Shelomo,
each one for his [particular] month;
they let nothing be wanting."
I Kings 5:8,"And as for the barley and the hay for the horses and for the pack-animals,
they would bring it to the place where he would be,
each one according to his turn."
I Kings 5:9,"And God gave wisdom to Shelomo,
and discernment, exceedingly much,
and breadth of mind
like the sand that is on the shore of the sea,"
I Kings 5:10,"so that much greater was Shelomo’s wisdom than the wisdom of all the Children of the East,
and than the wisdom of Egypt."
I Kings 5:11,"He was wiser than all [other] human beings—
than Eitan the Ezrahite
and Heiman and Kalkol and Darda, the sons of Mahol,
and his fame was throughout all the nations, all around."
I Kings 5:12,"He spoke three thousand proverbs,
and his songs were five and a thousand."
I Kings 5:13,"And he spoke of trees,
from the cedar that is in the Levanon
to the hyssop that grows out of the wall;
and he spoke of animals, of birds, of crawling things, and of fish."
I Kings 5:14,"And they came from all the peoples to hear Shelomo’s wisdom,
from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom."
I Kings 5:15,"Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Shelomo,
for he had heard that it was he who had been anointed as king in place of his father
—for Hiram had loved David [in covenant] all the days."
I Kings 5:16,"And Shelomo sent word to Hiram, saying:"
I Kings 5:17,"You yourself know [regarding] David my father
that he was not able to build a House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small> his God,
because of the wars that surrounded him,
until Y<small>HWH</small> put them beneath the soles of my feet."
I Kings 5:18,"But now,
Y<small>HWH</small> my God has granted me rest round about;
there is no adversary and no evil circumstance."
I Kings 5:19,"So here, I intend to build a House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
as Y<small>HWH</small> promised to David my father, saying:
Your son whom I will put in your place on your throne,
<i>he</i> will build the House for my name!"
I Kings 5:20,"So-now,
command that they cut down cedars for me from the Levanon;
my servants will be beside your servants,
and your servants’ wage I will give you, according to whatever you say,
for you yourself know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut down trees like the Sidonians."
I Kings 5:21,"It was, when Hiram heard Shelomo’s words,
that he rejoiced exceedingly;
he said:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small> today,
who has given David a wise son over this numerous people!"
I Kings 5:22,"And Hiram sent to Shelomo, saying:
I have heard [the message] that you sent to me;
I myself will do whatever you desire
regarding cedar trees and regarding juniper trees."
I Kings 5:23,"My servants will bring them down from the Levanon to the Sea,
and <i>I</i> will make them into rafts at the Sea, for any place that you send to me;
then I will break them up there, so that <i>you</i> may carry them away.
As for you, you will do my desire, to give food for my household."
I Kings 5:24,"So Hiram would give Shelomo cedar trees and juniper trees, whatever he desired,"
I Kings 5:25,"while Shelomo gave Hiram twenty thousand <i>cors</i> of wheat as food for his household,
and twenty <i>cors</i> of pressed oil.
Thus did Shelomo give Hiram, year by year."
I Kings 5:26,"And Y<small>HWH</small> gave wisdom to Shelomo, as he had promised him;
there was <i>shalom</i>/peace between Hiram and Shelomo,
and the two of them cut a covenant."
I Kings 5:27,"King Shelomo raised up labor-gangs from all Israel,
and the labor-force was thirty thousand men."
I Kings 5:28,"He sent them to the Levanon,
ten thousand per month, in shifts:
one month they would be in the Levanon, [and] two months at home.
And Adoniram was [The One] Over the Labor-force."
I Kings 5:29,"Now Shelomo had seventy thousand burden carriers
and eighty thousand stone-cutters in the hill-quarry,"
I Kings 5:30,"aside from the prefect commanders of Shelomo who were Over the Work,
three thousand and three hundred, who supervised the people, those doing the work."
I Kings 5:31,"The king commanded that they transport [from the quarry] large stones, costly stones for setting-the-foundation of the House [with] hewn stones."
I Kings 5:32,"And Shelomo’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Giblites carved them.
Thus they prepared the timber and the stone for building the House."
I Kings 6:1,"Now it was in year four hundred and eighty of the years of the Children of Israel’s going out from the land of Egypt,
in the fourth year—in the month of Ziv, that is the second month—of Shelomo’s reign as king over Israel,
that he [began] building the House to Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 6:2,"And the House that King Shelomo built for Y<small>HWH</small> was:
sixty cubits its length, twenty its width, and thirty cubits its height."
I Kings 6:3,"As for the portico at the front of the Great-Hall of the House:
twenty cubits was its length, along the width of the House,
and ten by the cubit its depth, in front of the House."
I Kings 6:4,"And he made windows for the House, framed [and] latticed,"
I Kings 6:5,"and he built an extension against the wall of the House, all around,
namely, along the walls of the House,
round about the Great-Hall and the Rear-Chamber,
and he made side-chambers all around."
I Kings 6:6,"The lowest side-chamber was five by the cubit its width,
with the middle one, six by the cubit its width,
and the third one, seven cubits its width,
for he placed offsets for the House, all around, on the exterior,
so as not to fasten [them] to the walls of the House."
I Kings 6:7,"And the House as it was being built,
of complete quarry stone it was built,
and [neither] hammers nor pickax—any tool of iron—
was heard in the House as it was being built."
I Kings 6:8,"The entrance to the lowest side-chamber was on the right shoulder of the House,
while winding-stairs went up to the middle one from the lower one, and from the middle one to the third one."
I Kings 6:9,"So he built the House and finished it:
he covered the House with hollow-squares and beam-projections, of cedar."
I Kings 6:10,"He built the extension along the entire House, five cubits its height,
and secured the House with cedar wood."
I Kings 6:11,"Now the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Shelomo, saying:"
I Kings 6:12,"[Regarding] this House that you are building:
if you walk in my ways, and my practices you observe,
and you keep my commandments, walking in them,
I will fulfill my word with you which I promised to David your father:"
I Kings 6:13,"I will dwell in the midst of the Children of Israel,
and I will not abandon my people Israel!"
I Kings 6:14,So Shelomo built the House and finished it;
I Kings 6:15,"he built the walls of the House on the interior with cedar planks,
from the floor of the House up to the beams of the ceiling;
he overlaid it with wood on the interior,
and overlaid the floor of the House with juniper planks."
I Kings 6:16,"And he built twenty cubits from the flanks of the House with cedar planks,
from the floor up to the beams,
and built it on the interior as a Rear-Chamber, the Holiest Holy-Place."
I Kings 6:17,"Forty by the cubit [long] was the House—
that was the Great-Hall in front [of it]."
I Kings 6:18,"Now the cedarwork of the interior of the House was carving of gourds and open flowers;
all was cedar, no stone was to be seen."
I Kings 6:19,"Now the Rear-Chamber within the House, in the interior, he prepared for placing there the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant."
I Kings 6:20,"And in the forepart of the Rear-Chamber were twenty cubits of length, twenty cubits of width, and twenty cubits its height,
and he overlaid it with refined gold.
And he overlaid the sacrificial-altar with cedar."
I Kings 6:21,"And Shelomo overlaid the House on the interior with refined gold;
he passed chains of gold across the front of the Rear-Chamber
and overlaid it with gold,"
I Kings 6:22,"and the entire House he overlaid with gold, until the entire House was done,
while the entire altar that belonged to the Rear-Chamber he overlaid with gold."
I Kings 6:23,"And in the Rear-Chamber he made two winged-sphinxes of oleaster wood,
ten cubits its height."
I Kings 6:24,"Five cubits was the wing of the one sphinx,
and five cubits was the wing of the second sphinx—
ten cubits from the tips of its wing to the tips of its [other] wing."
I Kings 6:25,"And ten by the cubit was the second sphinx,
a single measure and a single shape for the two winged-sphinxes."
I Kings 6:26,"The height of the one sphinx was ten by the cubit,
and thus for the second sphinx."
I Kings 6:27,"And he placed the winged-sphinxes in the middle of the inner House;
the wings of the sphinxes were spread out"
I Kings 6:28,And he overlaid the winged-sphinxes with gold.
I Kings 6:29,"Now all the walls of the House, round about, he carved with engraved carvings of winged-sphinxes and palmettes and open flowers,
on the inside and out."
I Kings 6:30,"And the floor of the House he overlaid with gold,
inside and out."
I Kings 6:31,"Now the entrance to the Rear-Chamber he made as doors of oleaster wood;
the jamb [and] the doorposts were a fifth [of the wall-length]."
I Kings 6:32,"As for the two doors of oleaster wood,
he carved on them carvings of winged-sphinxes, palmettes, and open flowers,
and overlaid them with gold,
and he hammered the gold over the winged-sphinxes and over the palmettes."
I Kings 6:33,"And so [too] he made for the entrance to the Great-Hall: posts of oleaster wood, a fourth [of the wall-length],"
I Kings 6:34,"and two doors of juniper wood,
with two rib-leaves for the one door, folding,
and two rib-leaves for the second door, folding,"
I Kings 6:35,"and he carved winged-sphinxes, palmettes, and open flowers,
and overlaid them with gold,
evenly over the chiseled-work."
I Kings 6:36,"And he built the interior courtyard of three rows of hewn-stones,
and a row of cut cedar."
I Kings 6:37,"In the fourth year
the House of Y<small>HWH</small> was laid-in-foundation,
in the month of Ziv."
I Kings 6:38,"And in the eleventh year, in the moon of Bul—that is the eighth month—
the House was finished, in all its details and in all its specifications;
he had built it in seven years."
I Kings 7:1,"Now his [own] house Shelomo built in thirteen years;
then he finished his entire house."
I Kings 7:2,"And he built the House of the Forest of the Levanon:
a hundred cubits its length, fifty cubits its width, and thirty cubits its height,
on four rows of cedar columns, with cut cedarwork atop the columns."
I Kings 7:3,"And it was covered with cedar from above, atop the planks that were on the columns,
forty-five: fifteen per row."
I Kings 7:4,"And the window-frames were of three rows,
with sight line toward sight line, three times."
I Kings 7:5,"And all the entrances and posts were square of frame, opposite,
sight line toward sight line, three times."
I Kings 7:6,"And the Portico of Columns he made: fifty cubits its length
and twenty cubits its width,
with a portico in front of them,
with columns and a cornice in front of them."
I Kings 7:7,"And the Portico of the Throne, where he would pronounce judgment, the Portico of Justice, he made;
it was covered with cedar, from floor to floor."
I Kings 7:8,"And his housing where he would reside, in the other courtyard within the portico,
was like this [same] pattern;
and he was [also] to make a house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Shelomo had taken [in marriage], like this portico."
I Kings 7:9,"All these were of costly stones, hewn according to measure,
smoothed with a smoothing-tool, within and without,
from the foundation to the coping,
from outside to the Great Courtyard."
I Kings 7:10,"It was founded [on] costly stones, large stones,
stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits."
I Kings 7:11,"And above were costly stones, hewn to measure, and cedar."
I Kings 7:12,"Now the Great Courtyard, all around, was of three rows of hewnstones and a row of cut cedarwork;
[so] for the inner courtyard of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and for the Portico of the Palace-House."
I Kings 7:13,"And King Shelomo sent and fetched Hiram from Tyre,"
I Kings 7:14,"the son of a widow woman, from the tribe of Naftali,
while his father was a Tyrian man, an engraver in bronze;
he was filled with practical-wisdom, discernment, and technical-knowledge
to make all kinds of work in bronze.
He came to King Shelomo and made all his work:"
I Kings 7:15,"he fashioned the two columns, of bronze—
eighteen cubits the height of the one column,
with a cord of twelve cubits [able to] go around it, and so the second column."
I Kings 7:16,"And two capitals he made
to put on the tops of the columns, cast in bronze—
five cubits the height of the one capital, and five cubits the height of the second capital,"
I Kings 7:17,"[with] networks made of netted making, twisted-decorations of chain making,
for the capitals that were on top of the columns:
seven for the one capital and seven for the second capital."
I Kings 7:18,"And he made the pomegranates,
with two rows surrounding [each] one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the columns,
and thus he made for the second capital."
I Kings 7:19,"And the capitals that were on the top of the columns
were a pattern of lilies, in the Portico,
four cubits."
I Kings 7:20,"And the capitals on the two columns were also above, close to the bulging-section that was across from the netting,
and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows, all around the second capital."
I Kings 7:21,"He set up the columns for the portico of the Great-Hall:
he set up the right column, and called its name <i>Yakhin</i>/He Establishes,
and he set up the left column, and called its name <i>Boaz/</i> In Him, Strength."
I Kings 7:22,"And on the top of the columns was a pattern of lilies.
Then the work of the columns was done."
I Kings 7:23,"He made the Sea-Basin, cast: ten by the cubit from its lip to its [other] lip, circular, all around,
five cubits its height,
and a line of thirty cubits could surround it, all around."
I Kings 7:24,"And gourd-ornaments were beneath its lip, all around, surrounding it,
ten in cubits, encompassing the Sea all around;
two rows of gourd-ornaments were cast at its casting."
I Kings 7:25,"[It was] standing on twelve oxen: three facing north, three facing seaward, three facing south, and three facing sunrise,
with the Sea upon them, from above,
and all of their hindquarters inward."
I Kings 7:26,"Its thickness was a handbreadth,
with its lip like the pattern of the lip of a cup, a lily flower.
Two thousand <i>baht</i>-measures could it contain."
I Kings 7:27,"He made the stands, ten, of bronze,
four by the cubit the length of each one stand,
and four by the cubit its width,
and three by the cubit its height."
I Kings 7:28,"And this was the pattern of the standwork:
they had enclosures,
and enclosures between the crosspieces—"
I Kings 7:29,"and on the enclosures that were between the crosspieces
were lions, oxen, and sphinxes,
and on the crosspieces were thus;
above and below the lions and the oxen were spirals of hammered making."
I Kings 7:30,"And four wheels of bronze were for each one stand, and axles of bronze,
and its four legs had shoulder-pieces under the basin;
the shoulder-pieces were cast across from each one in spirals."
I Kings 7:31,"And its mouth, within the capital, and above [it] for one cubit,
its mouth was circular, in the pattern of a pedestal,
a cubit and half a cubit,
and even on the mouth there were carvings.
Now their frames were square, not circular."
I Kings 7:32,"And four wheels were beneath the enclosures;
the supports of the wheels were in the stand, with the height of the one wheel a cubit and half a cubit."
I Kings 7:33,"Now the pattern of the wheels was like the pattern of a chariot wheel,
with their supports, their back-rims, their spokes, and their hubs— all were cast."
I Kings 7:34,"And the four shoulder-pieces were at the four corners of each one stand,
from the stand [itself came] its shoulder-pieces."
I Kings 7:35,"And at the top of the stand, half a cubit its height, was a circularband all around,
and at the top of the stand, its handles and its enclosures [came] from itself."
I Kings 7:36,"And he engraved on the panels, its handles, and on its enclosures:
sphinxes, lions, and palmettes, according to the bare space on each, with spirals all around."
I Kings 7:37,"Like this he made the ten stands,
with one casting, one measure, one shape for all of them."
I Kings 7:38,"Then he made ten basins of bronze—
forty baht-measures could each one basin contain;
four by the cubit, for each one basin,
one basin per one stand, for the ten stands."
I Kings 7:39,"And he placed the stands: five at the right shoulder of the House, and five at its left shoulder,
while the Sea he [had] placed on the House’s right shoulder, eastward, toward the south."
I Kings 7:40,"And Hiram made the pots, the shovels, and the sprinkling-bowls.
So Hiram finished making all the work
that he had made for King Shelomo for the House of Y<small>HWH:</small>"
I Kings 7:41,"the columns, two,
and the bowl-shapes of the capitals that were at the top of the two columns, two,
the netting-pieces, two, for covering the two bowl-shapes of the columns that were at the top of the columns;"
I Kings 7:42,"the pomegranates, four hundred, for the two network-pieces,
two rows of pomegranates for each one network, for covering the two bowl-shapes of the capitals that were on the top of the columns;"
I Kings 7:43,"and the stands, ten,
and the basins, ten, on the stands,"
I Kings 7:44,"and the one Sea,
with the oxen, twelve, beneath the Sea;"
I Kings 7:45,"and the pots, and the shovels, and the sprinkling-bowls—
all these vessels that Hiram made for King Shelomo, for the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
were of polished bronze."
I Kings 7:46,"In the round-plain of the Jordan the king had cast them, in thick soil,
between Sukkot and Tzaretan."
I Kings 7:47,"And Shelomo left all the vessels [unweighed], out of their exceeding, exceeding abundance;
the weight of the bronze could not be ascertained."
I Kings 7:48,"And Shelomo made all the vessels that were for the House of Y<small>HWH</small>:
the golden sacrificial-altar,
and the table on which was the Bread of the Presence, of gold,"
I Kings 7:49,"and the lampstands, with five to the right and five to the left,
in front of the Rear-Chamber, of refined gold,
and the flowerwork, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,"
I Kings 7:50,"and the bowls, the snuffers, the sprinkling-bowls, the ladles, and the incense-pans, of refined gold,
and the hinge-pieces for the doors to the inner house, the Holiest Holy-Place,
[and] for the doors of the House, for the Great-Hall, of gold."
I Kings 7:51,"And all the work that King Shelomo had made on the House of Y<small>HWH</small> was completed;
Shelomo brought the holy-objects of David his father:
the silver, the gold, and all the [other] vessels,
and he put them in the treasuries of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 8:1,"Then Shelomo assembled the elders of Israel,
all the heads of the tribes, the ancestral leaders of the Children of Israel, to King Shelomo in Jerusalem,
to bring up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH’s</small> Covenant from the City of David—that is Zion."
I Kings 8:2,"And every man of Israel assembled to King Shelomo, in the month of Etanim/Ever-Flowing, at the Festival—that is the seventh month."
I Kings 8:3,"And all the elders of Israel came,
and the priests carried the Coffer;"
I Kings 8:4,"they brought up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> along with the Tent of Appointment and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent;
the priests and the Levites brought them up."
I Kings 8:5,"Meanwhile, King Shelomo and the entire community of Israel who were present with him before the Coffer
were offering-sacrifices of sheep and oxen
which could not be numbered or measured in abundance."
I Kings 8:6,"And the priests brought the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant to its place, to the Rear-Chamber of the House, to the Holiest Holy-Place,
beneath the wings of the sphinxes."
I Kings 8:7,"For the sphinxes were spreading [their] wings to the place of the Coffer,
so that the sphinxes were sheltering the Coffer and its poles from above."
I Kings 8:8,"And the poles were so long that the heads of the poles could be seen from the Holy-Place in front of the Rear-Chamber, but could not be seen outside;
they have been there until this day."
I Kings 8:9,"There is nothing in the Coffer
save the two stone tablets that Moshe had put there at Horev,
when Y<small>HWH</small> had cut [a covenant] with the Children of Israel, at their going out from the land of Egypt."
I Kings 8:10,"And it was, at the priests’ going out from the Holy-Place,
that the cloud filled the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Kings 8:11,"and the priests were not able to stand to attend because of the cloud,
for the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> had filled the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 8:12,"Then Shelomo said:
Y<small>HWH</small> has determined to dwell in thick darkness."
I Kings 8:13,"I have built, yes, built a lofty House for you,
a fixed-place for your [royal] seat, for the ages."
I Kings 8:14,"And the king turned his face and blessed the entire assembly of Israel
while the entire assembly of Israel was standing;"
I Kings 8:15,"he said:
Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
who promised David my father with his own mouth,
and with his own hand confirmed, saying:"
I Kings 8:16,"From the day that I brought out my people Israel from Egypt,
I have not chosen a city from all the tribes of Israel
[in which] to build a House, to have my name be there.
But I chose David to be over my people Israel,"
I Kings 8:17,"and it was in the heart of David my father to build a House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
I Kings 8:18,"so Y<small>HWH</small> said to David my father:
Because it was in your heart to build a House for my name,
you have done well, for it was in your heart."
I Kings 8:19,"However: <i>you</i> shall not build the House,
rather, your son, the one going out of your loins,
<i>he</i> shall build the House for my name."
I Kings 8:20,"And Y<small>HWH</small> has fulfilled his word which he promised:
I have arisen in the place of David my father,
and have taken seat on the throne of Israel, as Y<small>HWH</small> promised;
I have built the House for the name of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,"
I Kings 8:21,"and I have put there a place for the Coffer, in which is Y<small>HWH</small>’s covenant
that he cut with our fathers, when he brought them out from the land of Egypt."
I Kings 8:22,"Then Shelomo stood in front of the altar of Y<small>HWH</small>, opposite the entire assembly of Israel,
and he spread his palms heavenward"
I Kings 8:23,"and said:
O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel,
there is none like you as a god
in the heavens above or on the earth beneath,
keeping the covenant, loyalty with your servants, those who walk in your presence with all their heart,"
I Kings 8:24,"who has kept regarding your servant David my father what you promised him;
you promised with your own mouth and with your own hand confirmed, as is this day."
I Kings 8:25,"So-now, Y<small>HWH</small> God of Israel,
keep for your servant David my father what you promised him, saying:
There will never be a man cut off from you in my presence,
sitting on the throne of Israel—
if only your sons keep their way, walking in my presence
as you have walked in my presence!"
I Kings 8:26,"So-now, O God of Israel,
pray let your word be confirmed that you promised to your servant David my father."
I Kings 8:27,"But will God really reside on earth?
Here, the heavens and the heavenmost heavens cannot contain you,
how much less this House that I have built!"
I Kings 8:28,"Yet turn your face to the prayer of your servant, and to his plea, O Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
to hearken to the cry-of-praise and to the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence today,"
I Kings 8:29,"that your eyes may be open toward this House, night and day,
toward the place about which you said: My name will be there,
to hearken to the prayer that your servant will pray toward this place."
I Kings 8:30,"And when you hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel
that they will pray toward this place—
then may <i>you</i> hearken at the place of your [royal] seat in the heavens;
may you hearken and may you forgive!"
I Kings 8:31,"Should a person sin against his neighbor
and he lifts up an oath-curse upon him, to put him under a curse,
and he comes with the oath-curse before your altar, in this House—"
I Kings 8:32,"then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens
and may you act and judge your servants,
to bring punishment on the guilty, by putting his way on his head,
and to vindicate the innocent, by giving him according to his innocence."
I Kings 8:33,"When your people Israel is defeated before an enemy, because
they have sinned against you,
and then they return to you and praise your name,
and they pray and plead to you in this House,"
I Kings 8:34,"then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens
and may you forgive the sin of your people Israel,
and return them to the soil that you gave to their fathers."
I Kings 8:35,"When the heavens are held back, and there is no early-rain,
because they have sinned against you,
and they pray toward this place, and praise your name,
and from their sin they turn, since you afflicted them—"
I Kings 8:36,"then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens,
and may you forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel,
so that you instruct them the good way in which they should walk,
and may you give rain upon your land which you gave to your people as heriditary-property."
I Kings 8:37,"A famine—if it should come upon the land;
pestilence—if it should come;
blight, green-mildew, ravaging locust, grasshopper—if it should come;
if his enemy should put him in straits in one of his gates;
whatever the affliction, whatever the sickness:"
I Kings 8:38,"[for] any prayer, any plea that any person might have among any of your people Israel
who knows the affliction in his heart, and spreads his palms toward this House—"
I Kings 8:39,"then may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens, the fixed-place of your [royal] seat;
may you forgive and act, giving to each according to all his ways,
[seeing] that you know his heart,
for you yourself know the heart of every human being,"
I Kings 8:40,in order that they may hold you in awe all the days that they live on the face of the ground that you have given to our fathers.
I Kings 8:41,"And also to the foreigner, who is not from your people Israel,
but comes from a land far off for the sake of your name,"
I Kings 8:42,"for he hears of your great name
and your strong hand and your outstretched arm,
and comes and prays toward this House—"
I Kings 8:43,"may <i>you</i> hearken in the heavens, the fixed-place of your [royal] seat,
and may you act,
in accordance with all that the foreigner calls out to you,
in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name,
holding you in awe as your people Israel [does],
and acknowledging that your name is called over this House that I have built."
I Kings 8:44,"When your people goes out to battle against its enemy, on the road that you send them,
and they pray to Y<small>HWH</small>, toward the city that you have chosen
and the House that I have built for your name—"
I Kings 8:45,"then may you hearken in the heavens to their prayer and to their plea,
and may you act justly toward them."
I Kings 8:46,"When they sin against you
—for there is no human being who does not sin—
and you rage against them, and give them before the enemy,
and they lead them captive, their captors, to the land of their enemy, far or near,"
I Kings 8:47,"but then they turn their heart in the land to which they were led captive,
and return and plead to you in the land of their captivity, saying:
We have sinned and we have done perversely, we have done wickedly!,"
I Kings 8:48,"and they return to you with all their heart and with all their being, in the land of their enemies who led them captive,
and they pray to you toward their land that you gave their fathers,
the city that you chose and the House that I have built to your name—"
I Kings 8:49,"then may you hearken in the heavens, the fixed-place of your [royal] seat,
to their prayer and to their plea;
may you act justly toward them"
I Kings 8:50,"and forgive your people who have sinned against you
for all the rebellious acts through which they have rebelled against you,
and grant them compassion before their captors, that they may have compassion on them."
I Kings 8:51,"For they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out from Egypt, from amid the iron furnace,"
I Kings 8:52,"so that your eyes may be open to the plea of your servant, and to the plea of your people Israel,
to hearken to them whenever they call out to you."
I Kings 8:53,"For <i>you</i> have set them apart for yourself as an inheritance
from all the peoples of the earth,
as you promised by the hand of Moshe your servant, when you brought out our fathers from Egypt, O Y<small>HWH</small> God!"
I Kings 8:54,"Now it was, when Shelomo had finished praying to Y<small>HWH</small> all this prayer and plea,
that he arose from in front of the altar of Y<small>HWH</small>, from bending down on his knees, with his palms spread toward the heavens,"
I Kings 8:55,"and he stood
and he blessed
the entire assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying:"
I Kings 8:56,"Blessed is Y<small>HWH</small>,
who has given rest to his people Israel, exactly as he promised;
not one thing has failed of all his good words which he promised by the hand of Moshe his servant!"
I Kings 8:57,"May Y<small>HWH</small> our God be with us
as he was with our fathers
—may he not abandon us, may he not leave us!—"
I Kings 8:58,"inclining our heart toward him
to walk in all his ways and to keep all his commandments, his laws, and his judgments
which he commanded our fathers."
I Kings 8:59,"And may these words of mine which I have pleaded in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
be near to Y<small>HWH</small> our God, day and night,
to render justice [for] his servant and justice [for] his people Israel,
each day’s need in its day,"
I Kings 8:60,"in order for all the peoples of the earth to know
that Y<small>HWH</small>, he is God, there is none else!"
I Kings 8:61,"And may your heart be complete with Y<small>HWH</small> our God,
to walk in his laws and to keep his commandments, as is this day!"
I Kings 8:62,"Now the king and all Israel with him were sacrificing sacrifices in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Kings 8:63,"and Shelomo sacrificed as the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that he sacrificed to Y<small>HWH</small>
twelve thousand oxen and a hundred twenty thousand sheep;
thus they inaugurated the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
the king and all the Children of Israel."
I Kings 8:64,"On that day
the king hallowed the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
for he performed there the offerings-up and the grain-gifts
and the fat parts of the <i>shalom-</i>offerings,
since the bronze altar that was in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> was too small for containing the offerings-up, the grain-gifts, and the fat parts of the <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
I Kings 8:65,"So Shelomo observed the Festival at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assemblage,
[coming] from Levo-Hamat to the Wadi of Egypt,
in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> our God, for seven days and seven days [more],
fourteen days."
I Kings 8:66,"On the eighth day he sent the people off,
and they gave the king farewell-blessing and went back to their tents,
rejoicing and [feeling] good at heart
over all the good things that Y<small>HWH</small> had done for David his servant and for Israel his people."
I Kings 9:1,"Now it was, when Shelomo had finished building the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, and the House of the King,
and every desire of Shelomo that he wished to do,"
I Kings 9:2,"that Y<small>HWH</small> appeared to Shelomo a second time, [just] as he had appeared to him at Giv’on."
I Kings 9:3,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
I have hearkened to your prayer and to your plea which you have pleaded before me—
I have hallowed this House that you have built in which to set my name there throughout the ages;
my eyes and my heart will be there all the days [to come]."
I Kings 9:4,"As for you, if you walk before me
as David your father walked—in wholeness of heart and in uprightness,
doing exactly what I commanded you,
and if my laws and my judgments you will keep,"
I Kings 9:5,"I will establish your kingly throne Israel for the ages,
as I promised regarding David your father, saying:
No one will be cut off from you on the throne of Israel!"
I Kings 9:6,"[But] if you should turn, yes, turn, you and your children, from [following] after me
and do not keep my commandments and my laws that I have placed before you,
but go and serve other gods and bow down to them,"
I Kings 9:7,"I will cut off Israel from the face of the ground that I have given them,
while the House that I have hallowed to my name
I will send away from my presence,
and Israel will become a proverb and a reproach among all peoples."
I Kings 9:8,"And this House will become a ruin;
all who cross by it will be appalled and will whistle, and they will say:
Why did Y<small>HWH</small> do thus to this land and to this House?"
I Kings 9:9,"And they will say:
Because they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small> their God, who brought their fathers out from the land of Egypt;
they held fast to other gods, they bowed down to them and served them—
therefore has Y<small>HWH</small> brought all this evil upon them!"
I Kings 9:10,"Now it was at the end of twenty years during which Shelomo built the two houses,
the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and the House of the King,"
I Kings 9:11,"—Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Shelomo with trees of cedar and trees of juniper, and gold, as much as he desired—
[that] then King Shelomo gave Hiram twenty towns in the region of the Galilee;"
I Kings 9:12,"but when Hiram went out from Tyre, to see the towns that Shelomo had given him,
they were not right in his eyes."
I Kings 9:13,"He said:
What are these towns that you have given me, brother?
So they called them the Region of Cavul/ As Nothing, until this day."
I Kings 9:14,And Hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.
I Kings 9:15,"Now this was the matter of the forced-labor that King Shelomo raised
for building the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, his own House, the Earthfill, the wall of Jerusalem,
and Hatzor and Megiddo and Gezer:"
I Kings 9:16,"—Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up
and had taken Gezer and burned it with fire,
while the Canaanites who were settled in the city he had killed,
and he had given it as a sendoff-gift to his daughter, Shelomo’s wife—"
I Kings 9:17,"Shelomo built Gezer and Lower Bet-Horon,"
I Kings 9:18,"Baalat and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land [of Judah],"
I Kings 9:19,"and all the storage towns that belonged to Shelomo and the chariot towns and the steeds’ towns,
and the desirable things that Shelomo desired to build in Jerusalem and in the Levanon,
and throughout all the land of his rule."
I Kings 9:20,"All the people left from the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites,
the Hivvites, and the Yevusites,
who were not of the Children of Israel,"
I Kings 9:21,"their children who were left after them in the land,
whom the Children of Israel were not able to devote-to-destruction—
Shelomo raised them up for slave labor, until this day."
I Kings 9:22,"But from the Children of Israel Shelomo did not make a slave,
for they were the men of battle, namely, his servants, his commanders, his officers, his chariot commanders, and his steed-riders."
I Kings 9:23,"[And] these were the prefect commanders, Those Over Shelomo’s Work:
fifty and five hundred,
who were supervising the people who were doing the work."
I Kings 9:24,"Nevertheless, Pharaoh’s daughter went up from the City of David to her house which he had built for her;
then he built the Earthfill."
I Kings 9:25,"Now Shelomo would offer up, three times a year, offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings
on the altar that he had built to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and would send up smoke with it, on the one in the presence of Y<small>HWH;</small>
thus he kept the House [in] complete [repair]."
I Kings 9:26,"Now Shelomo made a fleet-of-ships at Etzyon-Gever that is by Elat, next to the Reed Sea in the land of Edom."
I Kings 9:27,"And Hiram sent by ship his servants, the men for ships, those knowing the sea,
along with the servants of Shelomo."
I Kings 9:28,"They came to Ofir and took away gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents,
and they brought it to King Shelomo."
I Kings 10:1,"Now the Queen of Sheba had been hearing the reports of Shelomo, for the fame of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and so she came to test him with riddles."
I Kings 10:2,"She came to Jerusalem with an exceedingly heavy array:
camels carrying spices and gold, in exceeding abundance, and precious stones.
She came to Shelomo and spoke to him all that was on her mind,"
I Kings 10:3,"and Shelomo told her [the answer to] all her words;
there was no matter so hidden from the king that he could not tell her."
I Kings 10:4,"And the Queen of Sheba saw all Shelomo’s wisdom,
and the House that he had built,"
I Kings 10:5,"and the food at his table, the seating of his court-servants, his attendants’ standing and their attire, and his cupbearers,
and his offering[s]-up that he would offer up in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and she was left breathless."
I Kings 10:6,"She said to the king:
True was the word that I heard in my land about your way-with-words, about your wisdom!"
I Kings 10:7,"Now I did not believe the words until I came [here] and my own eyes saw it,
but here: I had not been told the half [of it]:
you have more wisdom and bounty than the report that I had heard!"
I Kings 10:8,"O the happiness of your men, O the happiness of these your servants who stand [in attendance] before you regularly,
who hear your wisdom!"
I Kings 10:9,"May Y<small>HWH</small> your God be blessed,
who has taken pleasure in you,
to place you on the throne of Israel.
Because of Y<small>HWH’s</small> love for Israel, for the ages,
he has made you king, to render justice and equity!"
I Kings 10:10,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold
and an exceeding abundance of spices, and precious stones;
such spices never came again in abundance
that the Queen of Sheba gave King Shelomo."
I Kings 10:11,"And also Hiram’s ships, which carried gold from Ofir,
brought <i>almug</i> wood from Ofir, exceedingly much, and precious stones."
I Kings 10:12,"And the king made from the <i>almug</i> wood railings for the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and for the House of the King,
and lyres and harps for the singers;
no such <i>almug</i> wood had come [before],
and none has been seen until this day."
I Kings 10:13,"Now King Shelomo gave the Queen of Sheba whatever she wished, that she had requested,
aside from what had been given her according to the capacity of King Shelomo.
Then she faced about and went back to her land, she and her servants."
I Kings 10:14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Shelomo in a single year
was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,"
I Kings 10:15,"besides [what came] from the tradesmen and from the commerce of the merchants
and all the kings of Arabia and governors of the land."
I Kings 10:16,"And King Shelomo made two hundred [large] shields of hammered gold,
—six hundred gold pieces would go for each one shield—"
I Kings 10:17,"and three hundred bucklers of hammered gold
—three <i>minas</i> of gold would go for each one buckler—
and the king put them in the House of the Forest of the Levanon."
I Kings 10:18,"And the king made a great throne of ivory,
and he overlaid it with refined gold."
I Kings 10:19,"There were six steps for the throne,
with a rounded top to the throne, on its back,
with armrests on this-side and on that-side at the place of sitting,
and two lions standing beside the armrests,"
I Kings 10:20,"and twelve male-lions standing there on the six steps, on this-side and on that-side;
none such was made in any [other] kingdom."
I Kings 10:21,"Now all of King Shelomo’s drinking vessels were of gold,
while all the vessels of the House of the Forest of the Levanon were of fine gold;
there were none of silver—it was not reckoned of any [value] in the days of Shelomo."
I Kings 10:22,"For the king had a shipping-fleet of Tarshish on the sea,
along with Hiram’s ships;
once out of every three years, a ship of Tarshish would come
carrying gold and silver,
tusks, monkeys, and peacocks."
I Kings 10:23,"So King Shelomo was greater than all the kings of the earth, in riches and in wisdom,"
I Kings 10:24,"and all the earth was seeking Shelomo’s face
to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart;"
I Kings 10:25,"they brought, each one, his tribute:
vessels of silver and vessels of gold,
clothing and weaponry and spices,
horses and mules—
each year’s due in its year."
I Kings 10:26,"And Shelomo gathered chariots and steeds:
he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand steeds,
and he put them in chariot towns and with the king in Jerusalem."
I Kings 10:27,"And the king made the silver in Jerusalem like stones,
while the cedars he made like sycamores that are in the lowlands, in abundance."
I Kings 10:28,"And the import-source of horses for Shelomo was from Egypt and from Kue;
the king’s merchants would get them from Kue at a fixed-price."
I Kings 10:29,"So a chariot imported from Egypt would go for six hundred silver pieces, and a horse for fifty and a hundred.
Thus it was for all the Hittite kings and the Amorite kings;
by their [own] hand they exported them."
I Kings 11:1,"Now King Shelomo loved many foreign women, along with Pharaoh’s daughter:
Moavites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites,"
I Kings 11:2,"from the nations of which Y<small>HWH</small> had said to the Children of Israel:
You are not to come among them and <i>they</i> are not to come among you—
surely, they will incline away your heart after their gods.
To them Shelomo clung in love."
I Kings 11:3,"He had princess wives, seven hundred,
and concubines, three hundred,
and his wives inclined away his heart."
I Kings 11:4,"So it was at the time of Shelomo’s old age:
his wives inclined away his heart after other gods,
and his heart was not complete with Y<small>HWH</small> his God,
like the heart of David his father."
I Kings 11:5,"Shelomo went [following] after Astarte godhead of the Sidonians
and after Milkom the Detestable One of the Ammonites."
I Kings 11:6,"So Shelomo did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH;</small>
he did not fully-follow after Y<small>HWH</small>, like David his father."
I Kings 11:7,"And Shelomo built a sanctuary to Kemosh the Detestable-One of Moav,
on the hill that faces Jerusalem,
and to Molekh, the Detestable One of the Children of Ammon."
I Kings 11:8,"Thus did he do for all his foreign wives,
those sending up smoke and offering-sacrifices to their gods."
I Kings 11:9,"So Y<small>HWH</small> was enraged at Shelomo,
for he had inclined his heart away from Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
who had appeared to him twice,"
I Kings 11:10,"and had commanded him about this matter, not to walk after other gods,
but he had not kept what Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded him."
I Kings 11:11,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Shelomo:
Because this was your [intention],
namely, you have not kept my covenant and my laws which I commanded you,
I will tear, yes, tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant!"
I Kings 11:12,"However, in your own days I will not do it,
for the sake of David your father;
from the hand of your son I will tear it away."
I Kings 11:13,"Yet I will not tear away the entire kingdom:
one tribe I will give to your son, for the sake of David my servant,
and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."
I Kings 11:14,"So Y<small>HWH</small> raised up an adversary to Shelomo,
Hadad the Edomite, who was from the royal seed in Edom."
I Kings 11:15,"Now it was, when David struck Edom, when Yoav Commander of the Armed-Forces had gone up to bury [all] the slain—
he struck down all the males in Edom,"
I Kings 11:16,"since for six months Yoav and all Israel stayed there, until he had cut off all the males in Edom—"
I Kings 11:17,"that Hadad ran away, he and his fighting-men, Edomites from among his father’s servants with him, to come to Egypt,
and Hadad was [then] a young lad."
I Kings 11:18,"They proceeded from Midyan and came to Pa’ran,
and took fighting-men with them from Pa’ran
and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt;
he gave him a house, and food he assigned for him,
and land he gave him."
I Kings 11:19,"And Hadad found exceeding favor in the eyes of Pharaoh,
so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of the <i>Tah’penes</i>, the queen-mother."
I Kings 11:20,"The sister of the <i>Tah’penes</i> bore him Genuvat his son, and the <i>Tah’penes</i> weaned him amid the house of Pharaoh.
And Genuvat remained in the house of Pharaoh, amid Pharaoh’s sons."
I Kings 11:21,"Now when Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay beside his fathers,
and that Yoav Commander of the Armed-Forces was dead,
Hadad said to Pharaoh:
Send me off, that I may go back to my land."
I Kings 11:22,"Pharaoh said to him:
What do you lack with me
that here, you seek to go back to your land?
He said:
No[thing], but send, send me off!"
I Kings 11:23,"And God raised up against him an[other] adversary,
Rezon son of Elyada,
who had run away from Hadad’ezer king of Tzova, his lord."
I Kings 11:24,"He gathered fighting-men to himself
and became commander of a raiding-band,
when David was killing them,
and he went to Damascus and settled in it, and he became king in Damascus."
I Kings 11:25,"He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Shelomo, along with the evil that Hadad … ;
he felt loathing at Israel,
and he reigned as king over Aram."
I Kings 11:26,"Now Yorov’am son of Nevat the Efratite, from Tzereda,
—his mother’s name was Tzerua, a widow woman—
was a servant of Shelomo,
but he raised a hand against the king."
I Kings 11:27,"And this is the matter in which he raised a hand against the king:
when Shelomo built the Earthfill,
he closed up the breach of the City of David his father."
I Kings 11:28,"Now the man Yorov’am was a mighty-man of valor;
Shelomo saw the lad,
that he was a [skilled] doer of work,
so he appointed him over all the burden-force of the House of Yosef."
I Kings 11:29,"It was at [about] that time,
when Yorov’am went out of Jerusalem,
that Ahiyya the Shilonite, the prophet, encountered him on the road
—he had covered himself with a new cloak—
and the two of them were alone in the open-field."
I Kings 11:30,"And Ahiyya seized the new cloak that was on him
and tore it into twelve torn-pieces;"
I Kings 11:31,"he said to Yorov’am:
Take yourself ten torn-pieces,
for thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Here, I am about to tear away the kingdom from the hand of Shelomo
and will give you the ten tribes,"
I Kings 11:32,"while the one tribe will remain his,
for the sake of my servant David
and for the sake of Jerusalem,
the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel—"
I Kings 11:33,"because he has abandoned me and bowed down to Astarte goddess of the Sidonians,
to Kemosh god of Moav,
and to Milkom god of the Children of Ammon,
and has not walked in my ways,
to do what is right in my eyes—my laws and my judgments,
like David his father."
I Kings 11:34,"But I will not take away the entire kingdom from his hand;
indeed, I will make him exalted-leader all the days of his life,
for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose,
who kept my commandments and my laws."
I Kings 11:35,"But I will take away the kingdom from the hand of his son
and will give it to you,
the ten tribes."
I Kings 11:36,"Yet to his son I will give one tribe,
in order that there may be a lamp for David my servant all the days [to come] in my presence in Jerusalem,
the city that I chose for myself to put my name there."
I Kings 11:37,"And you I will take,
that you may reign as king over all that you crave,
and you shall be king over Israel."
I Kings 11:38,"Now it will be:
if you hearken to all that I command you,
and walk in my ways,
and do what is right in my eyes,
keeping my laws and my commandments
as David my servant did,
then I will be with you;
I will build you a firm house, as I built for David,
and I will give you Israel."
I Kings 11:39,"And I will afflict the seed of David on account of this,
yet not for all the days [to come]."
I Kings 11:40,"Shelomo sought to put Yorov’am to death,
so Yorov’am arose and ran away to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt,
and remained in Egypt until Shelomo’s death."
I Kings 11:41,"Now the rest of the events of Shelomo, and all that he did, and his wisdom—
are they not written in the Record of the Events of Shelomo?"
I Kings 11:42,"Now the days that Shelomo reigned as king in Jerusalem, over all Israel, were forty years;"
I Kings 11:43,"then Shelomo lay beside his fathers,
and he was buried in the City of David his father,
and Rehav’am his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 12:1,"Rehav’am went to Shekhem,
for to Shekhem all Israel came to make him king."
I Kings 12:2,"And it was, when Yorov’am son of Nevat heard—he was still in Egypt, where he had run away from before King Shelomo—
that Yorov’am returned from Egypt."
I Kings 12:3,"They sent and called for him, and Yorov’am and the entire assembly of Israel came
and spoke to Rehav’am, saying:"
I Kings 12:4,"Your father made our yoke hard,
but <i>you</i> now, lighten your father’s hard servitude
and the heavy yoke that he placed upon us,
and we will serve you!"
I Kings 12:5,"He said to them:
Go off for three days, and [then] return to me.
So the people went off."
I Kings 12:6,"And King Rehav’am sought advice from the elders who had stood before Shelomo his father when he was alive, saying:
How do you advise returning word to this people?"
I Kings 12:7,"They spoke to him, saying:
If today you would be servant to this people, and would serve them,
then answer them and speak good words to them,
and they will be servants to you all the days [to come]."
I Kings 12:8,"But he abandoned the advice of the elders which they had advised him;
he sought advice from the youngsters who had grown up with him, who were standing [in service] before him."
I Kings 12:9,"He said to them:
What do you advise that we return as word to this people,
who spoke to me, saying:
Lighten the yoke that your father placed upon us!?"
I Kings 12:10,"The youngsters who had grown up with him said:
Say thus to this people who spoke to you, saying:
Your father made our yoke heavy,
but you—lighten [it] from upon us!
Thus should you speak to them:
My little-thing is thicker than my father’s loins!"
I Kings 12:11,"So-now:
my father loaded a heavy yoke upon you,
but <i>I</i> will add to your yoke;
my father disciplined you with whips,
but <i>I</i> will discipline you with “scorpions”!"
I Kings 12:12,"So when Yorov’am and the people came to Rehav’am on the third day,
as the king had spoken to them, saying: Return to me on the third day."
I Kings 12:13,"And the king answered the people roughly;
he abandoned the advice of the elders that they had advised"
I Kings 12:14,"and spoke to them according to the advice of the youngsters, saying:
My father made your yoke heavy,
but <i>I</i> will add to your yoke;
my father disciplined you with whips,
but <i>I</i> will discipline you with “scorpions”!"
I Kings 12:15,"Now the king did not hearken to the people,
for it was a reversal-of-events from Y<small>HWH</small>,
in order that he might fulfill his word that Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken by the hand of Ahiyya the Shilonite to Yorov’am son of Nevat."
I Kings 12:16,"And all Israel saw that the king had not hearkened to them,
so the people returned word to the king, saying:
What portion do we have in David?
No inheritance in the son of Yishai!
To your tents, O Israel!
Now—see to your own house, O David!
And Israel went back to their tents."
I Kings 12:17,"But as for the Children of Israel who were settled in the towns of Judah,
Rehav’am reigned as king over them."
I Kings 12:18,"And King Rehav’am sent Adoram, [The One] Over the Forced-Labor,
but all Israel pelted him with stones, so that he died,
while King Rehav’am managed to go up into a chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
I Kings 12:19,So Israel rebelled against the House of David—until this day.
I Kings 12:20,"Now it was, when all Israel heard that Yorov’am had returned,
that they sent and called him to the Community
and made him king over all Israel;
there was no one [following] after the House of David except for the tribe of Yehuda alone."
I Kings 12:21,"Rehav’am came to Jerusalem, and he assembled the entire House of Judah, along with the tribe of Binyamin,
a hundred eighty thousand chosen ones, ready for battle,
to do battle with the House of Israel,
to return the kingship to Rehav’am son of Shelomo."
I Kings 12:22,"But the word of God [came] to Shema’ya, the man of God, saying:"
I Kings 12:23,"Say to Rehav’am son of Shelomo, king of Judah, and to the entire House of Judah, and Binyamin
and the rest of the people, saying:"
I Kings 12:24,"Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
You are not to go up, you are not to do battle with your brothers, the Children of Israel;
return, each one to his house, for from me is this matter!
They hearkened to the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and they turned back, going in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 12:25,"Yorov’am built up Shekhem in the highlands of Efrayim, and held seat in it;
then he went out from there and built up Penuel."
I Kings 12:26,"And Yorov’am said in his heart:
Now the kingdom may [well] return to the House of David;"
I Kings 12:27,"if this people should go up to make sacrifices at the House of Y<small>HWH</small> in Jerusalem,
the heart of the people will turn back to their lord, to Rehav’am king of Judah,
and they will kill me
and return to Rehav’am king of Judah!"
I Kings 12:28,"So the king sought advice,
and made two calves of gold.
He said to them:
Enough for you, going up to Jerusalem!
Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!"
I Kings 12:29,"He put the one at Bet-El,
while the [other] one he placed at Dan."
I Kings 12:30,"So this matter became a sin.
And the people went before the one, as far as Dan."
I Kings 12:31,"He made a temple-house [for] the sanctuaries,
and made priests from [all] quarters of the people who were not from the Sons of Levi."
I Kings 12:32,"And Yorov’am made a pilgrimage-festival in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month,
like the Festival that is in Judah,
and he went up on the sacrificial-altar;
thus did he make at Bet-El,
to offer-sacrifices to the calves that he had made,"
I Kings 12:33,"And he went up on the altar that he had made at Bet-El
on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the month that he had devised of his own heart;
so he made a festival for the Children of Israel.
And he went up on the altar, to send-up-smoke,"
I Kings 13:1,"when here, a man of God was coming from Judah by the word of Y<small>HWH</small> to Bet-El.
As Yorov’am was standing by the altar to send up smoke,"
I Kings 13:2,"he called over the altar with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>,
he said:
O Altar! Altar!
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Here, a son will be born to the House of David, Yoshiyyahu his name;
he will slay upon you
the priests of the sanctuaries who are sending up smoke upon you,
and human bones will he burn upon you!"
I Kings 13:3,"And he gave a portent on that day, saying:
This is the portent that Y<small>HWH</small> has spoken:
Here, the altar will be torn apart,
and spilled out will be the ash-heap that is on it!"
I Kings 13:4,"And it was, when the king heard the word of the man of God which he called out over the altar at Bet-El,
that Yorov’am stretched out his hand from over the altar, saying:
Seize him!
But his hand dried up, the one that he stretched out against him,
and he was not able to return it to himself."
I Kings 13:5,"And the altar was torn apart,
and the ashes spilled from the altar,
in accordance with the portent that the man of God had given him by the hand of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 13:6,"Then the king spoke up and said to the man of God:
Now soothe the face of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
and pray on my behalf, that my hand may be returned-in-health to me!
And the man of God soothed the face of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so that the king’s hand was returned-in-health to him,
and became as at the beginning."
I Kings 13:7,"The king spoke to the man of God:
Come back with me to the house and be refreshed,
so that I may give you a gift."
I Kings 13:8,"But the man of God said to the king:
If you were to give me half your house
I would not come back with you,
I would not eat food, I would not drink water in this place,"
I Kings 13:9,"for thus I was commmanded by the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
You are not to eat food, you are not to drink water,
and you are not to return by the way that you went!"
I Kings 13:10,"So he went off by another way,
and did not return by the way that he had come to Bet-El."
I Kings 13:11,"Now an old prophet was settled at Bet-El.
And his sons came and recounted to him all the doings that the man of God had done that day in Bet-El;
the words that he had spoken to the king,
they recounted them to their father."
I Kings 13:12,"Their father spoke to them:
By which way did he go?
—His sons had seen the way by which the man of God had gone, who had come from Judah.—"
I Kings 13:13,"He said to his sons:
Saddle a donkey for me.
So they saddled a donkey for him, and he mounted it,"
I Kings 13:14,"and he went after the man of God;
he found him sitting under an oak
and said to him:
Are you the man of God who came from Judah?
He said:
I am."
I Kings 13:15,"He said to him:
Go back with me to the house and eat [some] food."
I Kings 13:16,"He said:
I am not able to return with you, to come back with you,
and I will not eat food, I will not drink water with you in this place,"
I Kings 13:17,"for the word [came to me] by the word of Y<small>HWH:</small>
You are not to eat food, you are not to drink water there;
you are not to return, going by the way on which you went!"
I Kings 13:18,"He said to him:
I too am a prophet like you,
and a messenger spoke to me by the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Have him return with you to your house,
that he may eat food and drink water!
—He was lying to him."
I Kings 13:19,"So he returned with him
and ate food in his house, and drank water."
I Kings 13:20,"Now it was:
as they were sitting at the table,
the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to the prophet who had had him return,"
I Kings 13:21,"and he called out to the man who had come from Judah, saying:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Because you have revolted against Y<small>HWH</small>’s order
and have not kept the command that Y<small>HWH</small> your God commanded,"
I Kings 13:22,"but have returned and eaten food and drunk water in the place of which he spoke to you:
Do not eat food and do not drink water!—
your corpse shall not come to the burial-place of your fathers!"
I Kings 13:23,"And it was,
after his eating food and after his drinking,
that the donkey was saddled for him, belonging to the prophet who had had him return."
I Kings 13:24,"He went off, and a lion encountered him on the way, and caused his death,
and his corpse was [left] thrown into the way,
with the donkey standing near him,
while the lion was standing near the corpse."
I Kings 13:25,"Now here, some men were crossing by,
and they saw the corpse thrown into the way, with the lion standing near the corpse,
so they came and spoke [of it] in the town where the old prophet was settled."
I Kings 13:26,"And he heard, the prophet who had had him return from the way, and he said:
He is the man of God who revolted against Y<small>HWH’s</small> order,
so Y<small>HWH</small> gave him to the lion, so that he mangled him and put him to death,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had spoken to him."
I Kings 13:27,"And he spoke to his sons, saying:
Saddle me the donkey!
And they saddled it."
I Kings 13:28,"He went and found the corpse thrown in the way,
with the donkey and the lion standing near the corpse—
the lion had not eaten the corpse, and had not mangled the donkey!"
I Kings 13:29,"And the prophet lifted up the corpse of the man of God and put it on the donkey, and had him return;
then he came to the town of the old prophet, to beat [the breast] and to bury him."
I Kings 13:30,"He put his corpse in his [own] burial-place
and they beat [the breast] over him: Alas, my brother!"
I Kings 13:31,"And it was, after he buried him, that he said to his sons, saying:
When I die, you are to bury me in the burial-place where the man of God is buried;
near his bones put my bones."
I Kings 13:32,"For it will come, come-to-pass, the word that he called out by the word of Y<small>HWH</small>
concerning the altar that is in Bet-El and concerning all the sanctuary buildings that are in the towns of Shomeron."
I Kings 13:33,"After this matter, Yorov’am did not return from his evil way,
but he returned to making priests from [all] quarters of the people for the sanctuaries;
[to] whoever desired, he would give mandate, and he became a priest at the sanctuaries."
I Kings 13:34,"So this matter became a sin by the House of Yorov’am,
for effacing, for erasing [it] from the surface of the ground."
I Kings 14:1,"At [about] that time,
Aviyya son of Yorov’am became sick."
I Kings 14:2,"Yorov’am said to his wife:
Now arise and change your [appearance],
so that they will not know that you are Yorov’am’s wife,
and go to Shilo
—there is Ahiyya the prophet; it was he [who] declared me as king over this people—"
I Kings 14:3,"and take in your hand ten bread-loaves and biscuits and a bottle of honey
and come to him;
<i>he</i> will tell you what will happen to the lad."
I Kings 14:4,"Yorov’am’s wife did thus:
she arose and went to Shilo, and came to the house of Ahiyya.
Now Ahiyyahu was not able to see,
for his eyes were set from his hoary-age."
I Kings 14:5,"But God had said to Ahiyyahu:
Here, Yorov’am’s wife is coming
to search out a word through you concerning her son, for he is sick;
like this and like that you are to speak to her.
And it will be that when she comes, she will act-like-a-stranger."
I Kings 14:6,"Now it was, when Ahiyyahu heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the entrance,
that he said:
Come in, Yorov’am’s wife,
why now do you act-like-a-stranger?
I myself am sent to you with a hard [message]:"
I Kings 14:7,"Go, say to Yorov’am:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Because I exalted you from the midst of the people,
and made you <i>Nagid</i> over my people Israel,"
I Kings 14:8,"and tore the kingdom away from the House of David and gave it to you
—but you have not been like my servant David,
who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart,
doing only what was right in my eyes;"
I Kings 14:9,"you have done evil, more than all who were before you,
you have gone and made yourself other gods, namely molten ones, to provoke me,
and me you have thrown behind your back—"
I Kings 14:10,"therefore:
here, I am bringing evil upon the House of Yorov’am:
I will cut off from Yorov’am he who pisses against the wall,
[even] those fettered and forsaken in Israel,
and I will eradicate after [you] the House of Yorov’am
as a ball of dung is burned, until it is gone."
I Kings 14:11,"He who dies of Yorov’am in the city, the dogs will eat,
while he who dies in the open-field, the birds of the heavens will eat;
for Y<small>HWH</small> has spoken!"
I Kings 14:12,"As for you, arise, go back to your house;
when your feet come into the city, the child will die."
I Kings 14:13,"And all Israel will beat [the breast] for him and will bury him,
for he alone of Yorov’am will come to a burial-place,
because some good toward Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, has been found in him [alone] of the House of Yorov’am."
I Kings 14:14,"And Y<small>HWH</small> will raise up a king for himself over Israel, who will cut off the House of Yorov’am, this very day and even now."
I Kings 14:15,"Y<small>HWH</small> will strike Israel,
like a reed that sways in water,
and will uproot Israel
from this good ground that he gave their fathers,
and will scatter them across the River,
because they made their Ashera-poles,
provoking Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 14:16,"He will give Israel up, on account of Yorov’am’s sins which he sinned, and which he caused Israel to sin."
I Kings 14:17,"Yorov’am’s wife arose
and went back to Tirtza;
[just as] she was coming in to the threshold of the house,
the child died."
I Kings 14:18,"They buried him and all Israel beat [the breast] for him,
according to the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had spoken by the hand of his servant Ahiyyahu the prophet."
I Kings 14:19,"Now the rest of the events of Yorov’am,
how he waged battle and how he reigned as king—
here, they are written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel."
I Kings 14:20,"Now the days that Yorov’am reigned as king were twenty and two years;
then he lay beside his fathers,
and Nadav his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 14:21,"Now Rehav’am son of Shelomo reigned as king in Judah:
forty-one years old was Rehav’am at his becoming king,
and for seventeen years he reigned as king in Jerusalem,
the city that Y<small>HWH</small> had chosen to put his name there from all the tribes of Israel;
his mother’s name was Naama the Ammonite."
I Kings 14:22,"And Judah did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH:</small>
they aroused his zealous-indignation more than all their fathers had done, in the sins that they sinned."
I Kings 14:23,"They too built for themselves sanctuaries and standing-pillars and Ashera-poles
on every lofty hill and under every luxuriant tree."
I Kings 14:24,"And there were even [male] prostitutes in the land;
they did according to all the abominable deeds of the nations that Y<small>HWH</small> had dispossessed before the Children of Israel."
I Kings 14:25,"Now it was
in the fifth year of King Rehav’am,
that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem."
I Kings 14:26,"He took away the treasures of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and the treasures of the king’s house
—he took everything.
He [even] took all the gold bucklers that Shelomo had made,"
I Kings 14:27,"so King Rehav’am made, in their place, bronze bucklers;
he would entrust them to the hand of the Commanders of the Outrunners, those on watch at the entrance to the king’s house."
I Kings 14:28,"It was, whenever the king entered Y<small>HWH’s</small> House,
that the outrunners would carry them
and would return them to the outrunners’ guardroom."
I Kings 14:29,"Now the rest of the events of Rehav’am, and all that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
I Kings 14:30,And there was war between Rehav’am and Yorov’am all the days.
I Kings 14:31,"Rehav’am lay beside his fathers;
he was buried with his fathers, in the City of David.
Now his mother’s name was Naama the Ammonite.
And Aviyyam his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 15:1,"In year eighteen of King Yorov’am son of Nevat, Aviyyam became king over Judah."
I Kings 15:2,"For three years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Maakha daughter of Avishalom."
I Kings 15:3,"He walked
in all the sins of his father which he had done before him;
his heart was not complete with Y<small>HWH</small> his God,
like the heart of David his father."
I Kings 15:4,"But for the sake of David,
Y<small>HWH</small> his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem,
to establish his son after him and to let Jerusalem stand,"
I Kings 15:5,"since David did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH:</small>
he did not turn aside from all that he had commanded him all the days of his life—
save in the matter of Uriyya the Hittite."
I Kings 15:6,And there was war between Aviyyam and Yorov’am all the days of his life.
I Kings 15:7,"Now the rest of the events of Aviyyam, and all that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?
And there was war between Aviyyam and Yorov’am."
I Kings 15:8,"Aviyyam lay beside his fathers;
they buried him in the City of David,
and Asa his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 15:9,"In year twenty of Yorov’am king of Israel,
Asa king of Judah became king."
I Kings 15:10,"For forty-one years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Maakha daughter of Avishalom."
I Kings 15:11,"And Asa did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
like his father David:"
I Kings 15:12,"he put away the [male] prostitutes from the land,
and removed all the Illicit-Things that his fathers had made."
I Kings 15:13,"And also Maakha his mother—he removed her from being queen-mother,
since she had made the Horrid-Thing for Ashera;
Asa cut down her Horrid-Thing, and burned it at Wadi Kidron."
I Kings 15:14,"But the sanctuaries were not removed;
however, Asa’s heart was complete with Y<small>HWH</small> all his days."
I Kings 15:15,"He brought the holy-objects of his father and his own holy-objects into the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
silver, gold, and vessels."
I Kings 15:16,And there was war between Asa and Ba’sha king of Israel all their days.
I Kings 15:17,"Ba’sha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Rama,
so as not to allow going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah."
I Kings 15:18,"So Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and in the treasuries of the House of the King
and gave them into the hand of his servants,
and King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad son of Tavrimon son of Hezyon, king of Aram, who had seat in Damascus, saying:"
I Kings 15:19,"There is a covenant between me and you, as between my father and your father;
here, I am sending you a bribe of silver and gold—
go, violate your covenant with Ba’sha king of Israel,
that he may go up away from me!"
I Kings 15:20,"And Ben-Hadad hearkened to King Asa;
he sent the commanders of the soldiers who belonged to him against the towns of Israel
and they struck Iyyon, and Dan, and Avel Bet-Maakha
and all the Kinneret-regions, next to all the region of Naftali."
I Kings 15:21,"It was, when Ba’sha heard, that he refrained from building up Rama,
and returned to Tirtza."
I Kings 15:22,"Now King Asa mustered all Judah—there was no one clear [of obligation]—
and they carried away the stones of Rama and its timber, which Ba’sha had built up,
and King Asa built with them Geva/The Hill of Binyamin and Mitzpa."
I Kings 15:23,"Now the rest of all the events of Asa, and all his mighty-deeds, and all that he did,
and the towns that he built up—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?
However: at the time of his old age, he became sick in his feet."
I Kings 15:24,"And Asa lay beside his fathers;
he was buried with his fathers, in the City of David his father,
and Yehoshafat his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 15:25,"Now Nadav son of Yorov’am became king over Israel in year two of Asa king of Judah,
and he reigned as king over Israel for two years."
I Kings 15:26,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH:</small>
he walked in the way of his father and in his sin which he had caused Israel to sin."
I Kings 15:27,"And Ba’sha son of Ahiyya, of the House of Yissakhar, conspired against him;
Ba’sha struck him down at Gibbeton that belonged to the Philistines,
while Nadav and all Israel were besieging Gibbeton."
I Kings 15:28,"Ba’sha put him to death in year three of Asa king of Judah,
and reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 15:29,"And it was, when he became king,
that he struck down the entire House of Yorov’am;
he did not leave anyone breathing who belonged to Yorov’am, until he had wiped it out,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had spoken by the hand of his servant Ahiyya the Shilonite,"
I Kings 15:30,"because of the sins of Yorov’am which he sinned and by which he had caused Israel to sin,
in his provocation by which he provoked Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel."
I Kings 15:31,"Now the rest of the events of Nadav, and all that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
I Kings 15:32,And there was war between Asa and Ba’sha king of Israel all their days.
I Kings 15:33,"In year three of Asa king of Judah,
Ba’sha son of Ahiyya became king over all Israel in Tirtza, for twenty-four years."
I Kings 15:34,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH:</small>
he walked in the way of Yorov’am and in his sin, by which he had caused Israel to sin."
I Kings 16:1,"And the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Yehu son of Hanani regarding Ba’sha, saying:"
I Kings 16:2,"Because I elevated you from the dust and made you <i>Nagid</i> over my people Israel,
but you have walked in the way of Yorov’am and have caused my people Israel to sin,
provoking me by their sins—"
I Kings 16:3,"here, I will eradicate [those coming] after Ba’sha and after his House;
I will make your house like the House of Yorov’am son of Nevat:"
I Kings 16:4,"he who dies of Ba’sha in the city, the dogs shall eat,
while he who dies of him in the open-field, the birds of the heavens shall eat!"
I Kings 16:5,"Now the rest of the events of Ba’sha, and what he did, and his mighty-deeds—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
I Kings 16:6,"Ba’sha lay beside his fathers;
he was buried in Tirtza,
and Ela his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 16:7,"Then, too, by the hand of Yehu son of Hanani, the prophet,
the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [had come] concerning Ba’sha and concerning his house,
regarding all the evil that he had done in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
provoking him with the doings of his hands, being like the House of Yorov’am,
and because he had struck it down."
I Kings 16:8,"In year twenty-six of the years of Asa king of Judah,
Ela son of Ba’sha became as king over Israel in Tirtza, for two years."
I Kings 16:9,"And his servant Zimri, commander of half the chariotry, conspired against him.
Now he was in Tirtza, drinking himself drunk in the house of Artza, [The One] Over the Household in Tirtza,"
I Kings 16:10,"and Zimri came and struck him down, putting him to death,
in year twenty-seven of Asa king of Judah,
and he became king in his place."
I Kings 16:11,"And it was, when he became king, as soon as he sat on his throne,
that he struck down the entire House of Ba’sha
—he did not leave him one pissing against the wall,
either his blood-redeemers or his friends."
I Kings 16:12,"So Zimri wiped out the entire House of Ba’sha,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had spoken regarding Ba’sha, by the hand of Yehu the prophet,"
I Kings 16:13,"because of all of Ba’sha’s sins and the sins of Ela his son
which they had sinned and which they had caused Israel to sin,
provoking Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, with their futilities."
I Kings 16:14,"Now the rest of the events of Ela, and all that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
I Kings 16:15,"In year twenty-seven of the years of Asa king of Judah,
Zimri became king, for seven days in Tirtza.
Now the fighting-people were encamped against Gibbeton, which belonged to the Philistines."
I Kings 16:16,"And the fighting-people who were encamped heard [tell], saying:
Zimri has made a conspiracy, and he has even struck down the king!
So all Israel made Omri, Commander of the Armed-Forces, king on that day in the camp."
I Kings 16:17,"And Omri came up, and all Israel with him, from Gibbeton,
and they besieged Tirtza."
I Kings 16:18,"It was, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
that he went to the citadel of the king’s house,
and he burned down the king’s house with fire over himself, and so he died—"
I Kings 16:19,"for the sins which he had sinned,
doing what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
walking in the way of Yorov’am and in his sin which he did, to cause Israel to sin."
I Kings 16:20,"Now the rest of the events of Zimri, and his conspiracy that he conspired—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
I Kings 16:21,"Then the people Israel were split in half:
half of the people were [following] after Tivni son of Ginat, to make him king,
while half were after Omri."
I Kings 16:22,"But the people who were [following] after Omri were stronger than the people who were [following] after Tivni son of Ginat.
Then Tivni died, and Omri became king."
I Kings 16:23,"In year thirty-one of the years of Asa king of Judah,
Omri became king over Israel, for twelve years;
in Tirtza he reigned as king for six years."
I Kings 16:24,"He acquired the Hill Shomeron from Shemer, for two talents of silver
and built up the hill
and called the name of the city that he built after the name of Shemer, owner of the Hill Shomeron."
I Kings 16:25,"And Omri did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH;</small>
he did evil more than all who were before him:"
I Kings 16:26,"he walked in all the way of Yorov’am son of Nevat, and in his sin which he caused Israel to sin,
provoking Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, with their futilities."
I Kings 16:27,"Now the rest of the events of Omri that he did, and his mighty-deeds that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
I Kings 16:28,"Omri lay beside his fathers;
they buried him in Shomeron,
and Ah’av his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 16:29,"Now Ah’av son of Omri became king over Israel
in year thirty-eight of the years of Asa king of Judah;
Ah’av son of Omri reigned as king over Israel in Shomeron for twenty-two years."
I Kings 16:30,"And Ah’av son of Omri did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
more than all who were before him."
I Kings 16:31,"And as if it were a light matter, his walking in the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat,
he took as wife Izevel daughter of Etbaal king of the Sidonians,
and he went and served Baal, bowing down to him;"
I Kings 16:32,"he raised up a sacrificial-altar to Baal
at the House of Baal, which he built in Shomeron."
I Kings 16:33,"And Ah’av made the Ashera-pole.
Ah’av continued to do [much] to provoke Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
more than all the kings of Israel who were before him."
I Kings 16:34,"In his days, Hi’el the Bet-Elite rebuilt Jericho—
with Aviram his firstborn he laid-its-foundation,
and with Seguv his youngest he set up its doors,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had spoken by the hand of Yehoshua son of Nun."
I Kings 17:1,"Eliyyahu/Y<small>HWH</small> Is My God, the Tishbite, of the settled-folk of Gil’ad, said to Ah’av:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, before whom I stand,
if there be dew or rain during these years except at my word … !"
I Kings 17:2,"And the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to him, saying:"
I Kings 17:3,"Go from here
and face you eastward;
you are to hide in Wadi Kerit/ Cut Off which faces the Jordan."
I Kings 17:4,"And it will be: from the wadi you will drink,
while I have charged ravens to sustain you there."
I Kings 17:5,"So he went and did according to the word of Y<small>HWH:</small>
he went and stayed in the Wadi Kerit which faces the Jordan."
I Kings 17:6,"And the ravens were bringing him bread and meat in the morning
and bread and meat in the evening,
while from the wadi he would drink."
I Kings 17:7,"But it was at the end of some days that the wadi dried up,
for there had been no rain-showers in the land."
I Kings 17:8,"Then the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to him, saying:"
I Kings 17:9,"Arise, go to Tzarefat that belongs to Sidon:
you are to stay there,
[for] here, I have charged a widow woman there to sustain you."
I Kings 17:10,"So he arose and went to Tzarefat;
he came to the entrance of the town,
and here: a widow woman there was gathering [pieces of] wood.
He called to her and said:
Pray fetch me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink."
I Kings 17:11,"She went to fetch it,
and he called to her and said:
Pray fetch me a bit of bread in your hand."
I Kings 17:12,"She said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
if I have anything baked
except a palmful of meal in a jar
and a little oil in a jug …,
for here, I have been gathering two pieces-of-wood;
I will come home and make it for me and for my son,
and we will eat it and die."
I Kings 17:13,"Eliyyahu said to her:
Do not be afraid;
go, do according to your words,
but make me a small baked-cake from there first, and bring it out to me,
while for you and for your son, make [some] afterward."
I Kings 17:14,"For thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
The jar of meal will not be finished
and the jug of oil will not be lacking
until the day of Y<small>HWH’s</small> giving showers upon the face of the ground!"
I Kings 17:15,"She went and did according to the word of Eliyyahu,
and she ate, she and he and her household, for some days."
I Kings 17:16,"The jar of meal was not finished
and the jug of oil was not lacking,
according to the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had spoken by the hand of Eliyyahu."
I Kings 17:17,"Now after these events it was
that he became sick,
the son of the woman, the mistress of the house.
And his sickness was exceedingly strong,
until no breath was left in him."
I Kings 17:18,"She said to Eliyyahu:
What have I to do with you, O man of God?
You have come to me to bring my iniquity to mind, to cause the death of my son!"
I Kings 17:19,"He said to her:
Give me your son.
And he took him from her bosom and brought him up to the upper room, where he was staying,
and had him lie on his bed;"
I Kings 17:20,"then he called out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and said:
O Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
upon the very widow with whom I am lodging
will you bring evil, to cause the death of her son?"
I Kings 17:21,"And he measured himself out upon the child, three times,
and called out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and said:
O Y<small>HWH</small> my God,
pray let the life of this child return within him!"
I Kings 17:22,"And Y<small>HWH</small> hearkened to the voice of Eliyyahu;
the life of the child returned within him, so that he lived."
I Kings 17:23,"Then Eliyyahu took the child
and brought him down from the upper-room into the house,
and gave him to his mother.
Eliyyahu said:
See, your son is alive!"
I Kings 17:24,"The woman said to Eliyyahu:
Now indeed I know
that you are a man of God,
and that the word of Y<small>HWH</small> in your mouth is truth!"
I Kings 18:1,"Now it was many days [later]
that the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Eliyyahu
in the third year, saying,
Go, appear to Ah’av,
that I may give rain upon the face of the ground."
I Kings 18:2,"So Eliyyahu went to appear to Ah’av.
—Now the famine was strong in Shomeron.—"
I Kings 18:3,"And Ah’av called for Ovadyahu/Servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, [The One] Over the Household,
—now Ovadyahu held Y<small>HWH</small> in awe exceedingly;"
I Kings 18:4,"it was, when Izevel cut off the prophets of Y<small>HWH</small>,
that Ovadyahu had taken a hundred prophets
and had hidden them, fifty men in a cave, and sustained them with bread and water—"
I Kings 18:5,"and Ah’av said to Ovadyahu:
Come, let us cross through the land, to all the springs of water and to all the wadis.
Perhaps we will find some green grass, that we may keep horse and mule alive,
and will not have to cut off [any] of the animals."
I Kings 18:6,"So they divided the land between them, to cross through it:
Ah’av went on one road alone,
and Ovadyahu went on another road alone."
I Kings 18:7,"Now when Ovadyahu was on the road:
here was Eliyyahu, [coming] to meet him!
He recognized him, flung himself on his face and said:
Is it really you, my lord Eliyyahu?"
I Kings 18:8,"He said to him:
[It is] I.
Go, say to your lord: Eliyyahu is here!"
I Kings 18:9,"But he said:
How have I sinned,
that you are giving your servant into the hand of Ah’av, to cause my death?"
I Kings 18:10,"By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
if there be a nation or a kingdom where my lord has not sent there to seek you … ,
and when they say: He is not [here],
he makes the kingdom or the nation swear that they did not find you."
I Kings 18:11,"But now <i>you</i> say:
Go, say to your lord: Eliyyahu is here!"
I Kings 18:12,"It will be
that <i>I</i> will go from you,
and the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> will carry you to I know not where,
and I will come to tell Ah’av, and he will not find you—
so he will kill me!
Yet your servant has held Y<small>HWH</small> in awe since my youth."
I Kings 18:13,"Has it not been told to my lord what I did when Izevel was killing the prophets of Y<small>HWH:</small>
how I hid a hundred men of the prophets of Y<small>HWH</small>,
fifty men, fifty men [each] in a cave,
and sustained them with bread and water?"
I Kings 18:14,"But now <i>you</i> say:
Go, say to your lord: Eliyyahu is here!
So he will kill me!"
I Kings 18:15,"Eliyyahu said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, before whom I stand,
indeed, today I will appear to him!"
I Kings 18:16,"So Ovadyahu went to meet Ah’av, and he told him,
and Ah’av went to meet Eliyyahu."
I Kings 18:17,"And it was, when Ah’av saw Eliyyahu,
that Ah’av said to him:
Is this you, bringer-of-disaster on Israel?"
I Kings 18:18,"He said:
I have not brought-disaster on Israel,
but rather you and your Father’s House,
in that you have abandoned Y<small>HWH’s</small> commandments
and have walked after the Baals!"
I Kings 18:19,"So-now,
send [messengers], gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel,
along with the prophets of Baal, four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of Ashera, four hundred,
those eating at Izevel’s table."
I Kings 18:20,"Ah’av sent [messengers] among all the Children of Israel
and gathered the prophets at Mount Carmel."
I Kings 18:21,"And Eliyyahu came close to all the people and said:
How long will you hop on two branches?
If Y<small>HWH</small> is God, walk after him,
and if Baal, walk after him!
But the people did not answer him a word."
I Kings 18:22,"Eliyyahu said to the people:
<i>I</i> am left of the prophets of Y<small>HWH</small>, myself alone,
while the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men."
I Kings 18:23,"Let two bulls be given us,
and let them choose one bull for themselves,
and let them section it and put it atop the wood,
but fire they shall not put [on it].
<i>I</i> will prepare the other bull
and place it atop the wood,
but fire I will not put [on it]."
I Kings 18:24,"And you are to call on the name of your god,
while <i>I</i> will call on the name of Y<small>HWH</small>.
And it will be:
the god who answers with fire, he is God.
All the people answered, they said: The matter is good!"
I Kings 18:25,"Then Eliyyahu said to the prophets of Baal:
Choose yourselves the one bull and prepare [it] first, for you are the many,
and call upon the name of your god,
but fire you are not to put [on it]."
I Kings 18:26,"So they took the bull that he gave them and prepared [it],
and they called upon the name of Baal, from daybreak until noon, saying:
O Baal, answer us!
But there was no voice, and no one answering.
And they hopped all around the altar that they had prepared."
I Kings 18:27,"Now it was at noon, that Eliyyahu taunted them; he said:
Call out in a great voice, for he is a god!
Maybe he is busy—maybe “doing his business”—or maybe on the road for himself;
perhaps he is asleep and will wake up!"
I Kings 18:28,"So they called out in a great voice
and gashed themselves after their practice with swords and lances,
until blood spilled out over them."
I Kings 18:29,"And it was, when noon had passed, that they ranted on until the [time of the] offering up of the grain-gift,
but there was no voice, no one answering, and no attention."
I Kings 18:30,"Then Eliyyahu said to all the people:
Come close to me!
And all the people came close to him.
He mended the wrecked altar of Y<small>HWH;</small>"
I Kings 18:31,"then Eliyyahu took twelve stones, like the number of tribes of the Children of Yaakov,
to whom the word of Y<small>HWH</small> had [come], saying:
Israel shall be your name!,"
I Kings 18:32,"and he built the stones [into] an altar, to the name of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and made a channel [big enough] to house two <i>sei’as</i> of seed all around the altar;"
I Kings 18:33,"then he arranged the wood
and sectioned the bull
and placed it atop the wood,"
I Kings 18:34,"and said:
Fill four jugs with water
and pour it on the offering-up and on the wood.
And he said:
Double it! And they doubled it.
And he said:
Triple it! And they tripled it,"
I Kings 18:35,"so that water went all around the altar,
and also the channel filled up with water."
I Kings 18:36,"And it was, at the [time of] offering-up the grain-gift,
that Eliyyahu the prophet came close and said:
Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yisrael,
today let it be known
that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant,
and that it is by your word that I have done all these things."
I Kings 18:37,"Answer me, O Y<small>HWH</small>, answer me,
that this people may know that you, O Y<small>HWH</small>, are God,
that you yourself have reversed their heart!"
I Kings 18:38,"And fire of Y<small>HWH</small> fell
and consumed the offering-up and the wood
and the stones and the dust,
and the water that was in the channel it licked up."
I Kings 18:39,"All the people saw,
and they fell upon their faces, and said:
Y<small>HWH</small>, he is God! Y<small>HWH</small>, he is God!"
I Kings 18:40,"Eliyyahu said to them:
Seize the prophets of Baal!
Let not one of them escape!
They seized them,
and Eliyyahu brought them down to Wadi Kishon
and slaughtered them there."
I Kings 18:41,"Then Eliyyahu said to Ah’av:
Go up, eat and drink,
for hark! Roaring showers!"
I Kings 18:42,"So Ah’av went up to eat and to drink,
while Eliyyahu went up to the top of the Carmel and crouched down to the ground
and put his face between his knees."
I Kings 18:43,"Then he said to his serving-lad:
Now go up and look in the direction of the sea.
He went up and looked, and said:
There is nothing.
He said:
Again, seven times."
I Kings 18:44,"And it was, at the seventh, that he said:
Here, a small cloud like a man’s palm is coming up from the sea!
He said:"
I Kings 18:45,"And it was by then, by then
that the heavens became gloomy with clouds and wind,
and there were heavy showers;
so Ah’av mounted up and went to Yizre’el."
I Kings 18:46,"And the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was upon Eliyyahu:
he bound up his loins and ran ahead of Ah’av
as far as where you come to Yizre’el."
I Kings 19:1,"And Ah’av told Izevel
all that Eliyyahu had done,
and above all, that he had killed all the prophets with the sword."
I Kings 19:2,"So Izevel sent a messenger to Eliyyahu, saying:
Thus may the gods do, and thus may they add,
for by this time tomorrow I will make your life like the life of one of them!"
I Kings 19:3,"He was afraid, so he arose and went away for his life,
and he came to Be’er-Sheva that belongs to Judah,
and left his serving-lad there,"
I Kings 19:4,"while he himself went into the wilderness, a day’s journey.
He came and sat down under a broom tree,
and wished for his life to die;
he said:
Enough!
Now, O Y<small>HWH</small>,
take my life,
for I am no better than my fathers!"
I Kings 19:5,"He lay down and fell asleep under a broom tree.
And here, there was a messenger touching him!
He said to him:
Get up, eat!"
I Kings 19:6,"He looked,
and here, at his head was a cake [baked on] glowing coals, and a jug of water.
So he ate and drank, and returned to lie down."
I Kings 19:7,"And the messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> returned a second-time and touched him,
and said: Arise, eat!
For the journey is too much for you."
I Kings 19:8,"So he arose and ate and drank,
and walked in the strength of that eating for forty days and forty nights,
as far as the Mountain of God, Horev."
I Kings 19:9,"He came there, to a cave, and spent the night there.
And here, the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to him;
he said to him:
What [brings] you here, Eliyyahu?"
I Kings 19:10,"He said:
I have been zealous, yes, zealous for Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of the Forces-On-High,
for the Children of Israel have abandoned your covenant:
your altars they have wrecked
and your prophets they have killed with sword—
while <i>I</i> am left, myself alone,
and they have sought my life, to take it!"
I Kings 19:11,"He said:
Go out and stand on the mountain, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>.
And here, Y<small>HWH</small> was crossing by:
now a great and strong wind was crushing mountains and smashing boulders in the presence of Y<small>HWH—</small>
Y<small>HWH</small> was not in the wind;
and after the wind, an earthquake—
Y<small>HWH</small> was not in the earthquake;"
I Kings 19:12,"and after the earthquake, fire—
Y<small>HWH</small> was not in the fire;
but after the fire,
a still, small voice."
I Kings 19:13,"It was, when Eliyyahu heard,
that he wrapped his face in his mantle
and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave.
And here, there [came] to him a voice;
it said: What [brings] you here, Eliyyahu?"
I Kings 19:14,"He said:
I have been zealous, yes, zealous for Y<small>HWH</small>, God of the Forces-On-High,
for the Children of Israel have abandoned your covenant:
your altars they have wrecked
and your prophets they have killed with the sword—
while <i>I</i> am left, myself alone,
and they have sought my life, to take it!"
I Kings 19:15,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Go, return on your way, toward the Wilderness of Damascus;
when you come [there], you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram,"
I Kings 19:16,"and Yehu son of Nimshi you are to anoint as king over Israel,
while Elisha son of Shafat, from Evel-Mehola, you are to anoint as prophet in your place."
I Kings 19:17,"Now it shall be: he who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Yehu will put to death,
and he who escapes from the sword of Yehu, Elisha will put to death!"
I Kings 19:18,"But I will allow seven thousand to remain in Israel—
every [one of] the knees that has not bent to Baal
and every mouth that has not kissed him!"
I Kings 19:19,"He went from there and found Elisha son of Shafat,
—now he was plowing with twelve teams [of oxen] in front of him,
while he was with the twelfth—
and Eliyyahu crossed over to him and threw his mantle over him."
I Kings 19:20,"He left the oxen and ran after Eliyyahu,
and said:
Now let me kiss my father and my mother [good-bye];
then I will go after you.
He said to him:
Go, turn back!
For what have I done to you?"
I Kings 19:21,"He turned back from [going] after him
and took a team of oxen and slaughtered it,
and in the vessel [intended] for the oxen he boiled them, the meat;
he gave it to the people and they ate it.
Then he arose and went after Eliyyahu, and attended him."
I Kings 20:1,"Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered his entire army
—thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots—
and went up and besieged Shomeron, and did battle against it."
I Kings 20:2,He sent messengers to Ah’av king of Israel in the city;
I Kings 20:3,"he said to him:
Thus says Ben-Hadad:
Your silver and your gold—it is mine,
your women and your children, the best ones—they are mine!"
I Kings 20:4,"The king of Israel answered, he said:
According to your word, my lord king:
I am yours and all that I have."
I Kings 20:5,"The messengers returned and said:
Thus says Ben-Hadad, saying:
Indeed, I sent to you, saying:
Your silver and your gold, your women and your children, to <i>me</i> you must give them!"
I Kings 20:6,"But at this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you;
they will search your house and the houses of your servants,
and it will be: everything delightful in your eyes
they will put in their hand and they will take."
I Kings 20:7,"The king of Israel called for all the elders of the land
and said:
Now know and take-note that this one is seeking evil,
for he sent to me for my women and for my children, for my silver and for my gold,
yet I kept back nothing from him!"
I Kings 20:8,"Then all the elders and all the people said to him:
Do not listen,
you must not consent!"
I Kings 20:9,"So he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad:
Say to my lord king:
Every matter about which you first sent to your servant, I will do,
but this matter I am not able to do!
So the messengers went off, and returned word to him."
I Kings 20:10,"And Ben-Hadad sent to him
and said:
Thus may the gods do to me, and thus may they add,
if the dust of Shomeron suffices for handfuls for all the fighting-people who are behind me!"
I Kings 20:11,"The king of Israel answered,
he said: Speak on;
let not the one who buckles on boast like the one who strips off!"
I Kings 20:12,"Now it was, when he heard this word
—he was drinking, he and the [other] kings at Sukkot—
that he said to his servants: Set [the attack]!
So they set upon the city."
I Kings 20:13,"Now here, a prophet came close to Ah’av king of Israel, and said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
Do you see all this great throng?
Here, I am giving it into your hand today,
so that you may know that I am Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Kings 20:14,"Ah’av said:
Through whom?
He said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Through the squire-lads of the district commanders.
He said:
Who will bind up the battle-array?
He said:
You."
I Kings 20:15,"So he counted [for war] the squire-lads of the provincial commanders
—they were two hundred two and thirty—
and after them he counted all the fighting-people, all the Children of Israel: seven thousand."
I Kings 20:16,"And they went out at noon.
Now Ben-Hadad was drinking himself drunk at Sukkot,
he and the kings, thirty-two kings helping him."
I Kings 20:17,"And the squire-lads of the provincial commanders went out first;
they sent [to] Ben-Hadad
and told him, saying:
Men have gone out from Shomeron!"
I Kings 20:18,"He said:
If they have gone out for peace, seize them alive,
and if it is for battle that they have gone out, alive seize them [too]!"
I Kings 20:19,"But these went out from the city, the squires of the provincial commanders,
along with the army that was behind them;"
I Kings 20:20,"each man struck his man down,
and they fled to Aram, while Israel pursued them.
And Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse, with cavalry."
I Kings 20:21,"The king of Israel went out and struck down horse and chariot;
he struck Aram, a great striking-down."
I Kings 20:22,"And the prophet came close to the king of Israel and said to him:
Go, strengthen yourself;
know and take-note of what you must do,
for at the turn of the year, the king of Aram will go up against you."
I Kings 20:23,"Now the servants of the king of Aram said to him:
A god of the hills is their god,
therefore they were stronger than we;
but we should do battle with them in the plain
[and see] if we aren’t stronger than they!"
I Kings 20:24,"And this thing, do:
Remove the kings, each one from his place,
and put governors in their steads;"
I Kings 20:25,"while you, you are to number yourself an army
like the army fell away from you,
horse like horse, chariot like chariot,
that we may battle them in the plain,
[and see] if we aren’t stronger than they!
He hearkened to their voice, and did thus."
I Kings 20:26,"So it was, at the turn of the year,
that Ben-Hadad counted Aram [for war],
and he went up to Afek for battle with Israel,"
I Kings 20:27,"while the Children of Israel were mustered and provided [with food]
and went to meet them;
the Children of Israel encamped over against them
like two bare flocks of goats,
while Aram filled up the land."
I Kings 20:28,"And the man of God came close and said to the king of Israel, he said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Because Aram said: A god of the hills is Y<small>HWH</small>,
he is not a god of the valleys—
I will give all this great throng into your hand,
so that you may know that I am Y<small>HWH</small>!"
I Kings 20:29,"They encamped, these opposite those, for seven days,
and it was on the seventh day, that the battle came near;
the Children of Israel struck down of Aram a hundred thousand foot-soldiers in one day."
I Kings 20:30,"Those left fled to Afek, to the town,
and the wall fell upon the twenty-seven thousand fighting-men who were left.
Ben-Hadad [too] had fled, and he came into the town, into a room within a room."
I Kings 20:31,"His servants said to him:
Now here, we have heard that the kings of the House of Israel—indeed, they are kings [who keep] loyalty;
now let us put sackcloth on our loins and cords on our heads,
and let us go out [to surrender] to the king of Israel
—perhaps he will spare your life."
I Kings 20:32,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins and cords on their heads
and came to the king of Israel
and said:
Your servant Ben-Hadad says:
Pray spare my life!
He said:
Is he still alive? He is my brother!"
I Kings 20:33,"Now the men were practicing divination and quickly seized upon it,
and said:
Ben-Hadad is your brother!
And he said:
Come, fetch him!
So Ben-Hadad went out to him, and he pulled him up into the chariot."
I Kings 20:34,"He said to him:
The towns that my father took from your father, I return,
and you may put bazaars in operation for yourself in Damascus,
just as my father put in operation in Shomeron;
while I, under [this] covenant I will send you free.
So he cut a covenant with him, and sent him off."
I Kings 20:35,"Now a man from the Sons of the Prophets said to his neighbor:
By the word of Y<small>HWH</small>, pray strike me!
But the man refused to strike him,"
I Kings 20:36,"so he said to him:
Because you did not hearken to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>,
here, when you go from me, a lion will strike you down!
He went from beside him, and a lion found him and struck him down."
I Kings 20:37,"Then he found another man and said: Pray strike me!
And the man struck him, striking and wounding [him]."
I Kings 20:38,"Then the prophet went and stood [waiting] for the king, by the road,
and he disguised himself with a covering over his eyes."
I Kings 20:39,"It was, as the king was crossing by,
that he cried out to the king;
he said:
Your servant went out into the midst of the battle,
when here, a man turned aside and brought a man to me,
and he said: Guard this man—
if he is counted-missing, yes, missing [later],
it will be your life in place of his life,
or else you will have to weigh out a talent of silver!"
I Kings 20:40,"Now it was: your servant was facing here and there,
and then he was no more!
The king of Israel said to him:
Correct is your judgment: you yourself have decided."
I Kings 20:41,"Quickly he removed the covering from over his eyes,
and the king of Israel recognized him,
that he was of the prophets."
I Kings 20:42,"He said to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Because you sent free the man, one devoted-to-destruction by me, from [your] hand,
it will be your life in place of his life,
and your people in place of his people!"
I Kings 20:43,"The king of Israel went back to his house sullen and enraged;
thus he came to Shomeron."
I Kings 21:1,"Now after these events it was:
A vineyard belonged to Navot the Yizre’elite that was in Yizre’el,
next to the Great-House of Ah’av king in Shomeron."
I Kings 21:2,"And Ah’av spoke to Navot, saying:
Give me your vineyard, that it may be a garden of greens for me
—for it is nearby, next to my house—
and I will give you, in its place, a vineyard better than it;
[or] if it is better in your eyes,
I will give you silver for the price of this one."
I Kings 21:3,"But Navot said to Ah’av:
Y<small>HWH</small> forbid for me
from my giving over the inheritance of my fathers to you!"
I Kings 21:4,"Ah’av came back to his house sullen and enraged
over the word that Navot the Yizre’elite had spoken to him
when he said: I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers!
He lay down on his couch and turned away his face and would not eat food."
I Kings 21:5,"And Izevel his wife came to him
and spoke to him:
Now why is your spirit so sullen
that you do not eat food?"
I Kings 21:6,"He spoke to her:
Because I spoke to Navot the Yizre’elite;
I said to him:
Give me your vineyard for silver,
or, if you like,
I will give you a vineyard in its place—
yet he said: I will not give you my vineyard!"
I Kings 21:7,"Izevel his wife said to him:
Do <i>you</i>, now, exercise kingship over Israel?
Arise, eat food, that your heart may be in good-humor;
<i>I</i> will give you the vineyard of Navot the Yizre’elite!"
I Kings 21:8,"So she wrote letters in Ah’av’s name
and sealed [them] with his seal,
and sent the letters to the elders and the freemen who were in his town, those settled with Navot."
I Kings 21:9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying:
Proclaim a fast
and seat Navot at the head of the people;"
I Kings 21:10,"then seat two base men in front of him;
have them testify against him, saying:
You cursed God and the king!
Then bring him out and pelt him, so that he dies."
I Kings 21:11,"So they did, the men of his town
—the elders and the freemen that were settled in his town—
as Izevel had sent to them,
as was written in the letters that she had sent to them:"
I Kings 21:12,"they proclaimed a fast
and seated Navot at the head of the people,"
I Kings 21:13,"and the two base men came and sat in front of him;
the base men testified against Navot, in front of the people,
saying:
Navot cursed God and the king!
So they took him outside the town
and pelted him with stones, and he died."
I Kings 21:14,"Then they sent to Izevel, saying:
Navot has been pelted, and has died."
I Kings 21:15,"Now it was, when Izevel heard that Navot had been pelted, and had died,
that Izevel said to Ah’av:
Arise, take possession
of the vineyard of Navot the Yizre’elite
which he refused to give to you for silver,
for Navot is not alive,
for he is dead!"
I Kings 21:16,"It was, when Ah’av heard that Navot was dead,
that Ah’av arose to go down to the vineyard of Navot the Yizre’elite, to take possession of it."
I Kings 21:17,"But the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Eliyyahu the Tishbite, saying:"
I Kings 21:18,"Arise, go down
to meet Ah’av king of Israel who is in Shomeron:
here, [he is] at the vineyard of Navot,
where he has gone down to take possession of it."
I Kings 21:19,"You are to speak to him, saying:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Murdered have you, and dispossessed too?
And you are to speak to him, saying:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
In the place where the dogs have licked up the blood of Navot
the dogs will lick up your blood, even yours!"
I Kings 21:20,"Ah’av said to Eliyyahu:
Have you found me, my enemy?
He said:
I have found [you]!
Because you have sold yourself
to do what is evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Kings 21:21,"here, I will bring evil upon you
and will eradicate [those coming] after you
and will cut off from Ah’av he who pisses against the wall,
[even] the fettered and forsaken in Israel!"
I Kings 21:22,"I will give your house to be
like the House of Yorov’am son of Nevat,
like the House of Ba’sha son of Ahiyya,
because of the provocation by which you have provoked [me]
and caused Israel to sin."
I Kings 21:23,"And also about Izevel Y<small>HWH</small> has spoken, saying:
The dogs will eat Izevel
at the rampart of Yizre’el!"
I Kings 21:24,"He who dies of Ah’av in the town
the dogs shall eat,
while he who dies in the open-field
the birds of the heavens shall eat!"
I Kings 21:25,"—Surely there was never [another] like Ah’av,
who sold himself to do what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
whom Izevel his wife incited;"
I Kings 21:26,"he did exceedingly abominably in walking after the Illicit-Things,
exactly as the Amorites had done,
whom Y<small>HWH</small> had dispossessed before the Children of Israel.—"
I Kings 21:27,"Now it was, when Ah’av heard these words,
that he tore his garments and put sackcloth upon his flesh
and fasted,
and lay down in sackcloth,
and went around softly."
I Kings 21:28,"And the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to Eliyyahu the Tishbite, saying:"
I Kings 21:29,"Do you see that Ah’av is humbling himself before me?
Because he is humbling himself before me,
I will not bring the evil in his days;
in the days of his son I will bring the evil on his house."
I Kings 22:1,"They stayed put for three years,
[since] there was no war between Aram and Israel."
I Kings 22:2,"But it was in the third year
that Yehoshafat king of Judah went down to the king of Israel."
I Kings 22:3,"The king of Israel said to his servants:
Do you know that Ramot-Gil’ad is ours?
Yet we keep silent about taking it from the king of Aram!"
I Kings 22:4,"So he said to Yehoshafat:
Will you go with me in battle to Ramot-Gil’ad?
Yehoshafat said to the king of Israel:
I am as you are: my fighting-people as your fighting-people, my horses as your horses!"
I Kings 22:5,"And Yehoshafat said to the king of Israel:
Pray inquire of the word of Y<small>HWH</small> here-and-now."
I Kings 22:6,"So the king of Israel gathered the prophets, some four hundred men,
and said to them:
Shall I go against Ramot-Gil’ad in battle, or shall I refrain?
They said:
Go up—Y<small>HWH</small> will give it into the hand of the king!"
I Kings 22:7,"Yehoshafat said:
Is there not a prophet of Y<small>HWH</small> here, yet another, that we may inquire through him?"
I Kings 22:8,"The king of Israel said to Yehoshafat:
There is yet another man through whom one may inquire of Y<small>HWH</small>,
but I myself hate him,
for he never prophesies for good concerning me, but only for evil:
Mikhayhu son of Yimla.
Yehoshafat said:
Let not the king say thus!"
I Kings 22:9,"So the king of Israel called an officer and said:
Quickly! Mikhayhu son of Yimla!"
I Kings 22:10,"Now the king of Israel and Yehoshafat king of Judah were sitting, each one on his throne
clothed in [royal] garments,
at the threshing floor at the entrance to the Gate of Shomeron,
while all the prophets were prophesying before them."
I Kings 22:11,"And Tzidkiyya son of Kenaana made himself horns of iron
and said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
With these you shall gore Aram, until they are finished off!"
I Kings 22:12,"And all the prophets prophesied thus, saying:
Go up to Ramot-Gil’ad, and triumph,
for Y<small>HWH</small> will give [it] into the hand of the king!"
I Kings 22:13,"Then the messenger who had gone to call Mikhayhu spoke to him, saying:
Now here, the words of the prophets are as one mouth for good regarding the king;
pray may your word be like the word of one of them, so that you speak for good!"
I Kings 22:14,"But Mikhayhu said:
As Y<small>HWH</small> lives!
Indeed, whatever Y<small>HWH</small> says to me, that [alone] may I speak."
I Kings 22:15,"He came to the king, and the king said to him:
Mikhayhu, shall we go to Ramot-Gil’ad in battle,
or shall we refrain?
He said to him:
Go up and triumph;
Y<small>HWH</small> will give it into the hand of the king."
I Kings 22:16,"The king said to him:
How many times must I make you swear
that you are not to speak to me anything but truth in the name of Y<small>HWH?</small>"
I Kings 22:17,"So he said:
I saw all Israel scattered on the hills
like sheep that have no herder,
and Y<small>HWH</small> said: There are no masters for these.
Let each return to his house in peace!"
I Kings 22:18,"The king of Israel said to Yehoshafat:
Did I not say to you:
He never prophesies for good concerning me, but only for evil?"
I Kings 22:19,"He said:
Therefore, hearken to the word of Y<small>HWH:</small>
I saw Y<small>HWH</small> sitting on his throne,
with all the Forces of the Heavens standing over against him, on his right and on his left;"
I Kings 22:20,"and Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Who will entice Ah’av
so that he will go up and fall at Ramot-Gil’ad?
And this one said thusly, while that one said thusly."
I Kings 22:21,"Then a spirit came out and stood in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
and said:
<i>I</i> will entice him.
Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
In what [way]?"
I Kings 22:22,"He said:
I will go out and be a false spirit
in the mouth of all his prophets.
He said:
You will entice [him], aye, you will prevail.
Go out and do thus!"
I Kings 22:23,"So-now, here: Y<small>HWH</small> has placed a false spirit
in the mouth of all these your prophets,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has spoken evil regarding you!"
I Kings 22:24,"Then Tzidkiyyahu son of Kenaana approached and struck Mikhayhu on the cheek,
and said:
Which way did the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> cross over from me to speak with you?"
I Kings 22:25,"Mikhayhu said:
Here, you will see on that day,
when you enter a room within a room to hide!"
I Kings 22:26,"The king of Israel said:
Take Mikhayhu
and turn him over to Amon, commander of the town, and to Yoash, the son of the king;"
I Kings 22:27,"you are to say:
Thus says the king:
Put this one in the prison house and have him eat meager bread and meager water,
until I return in peace."
I Kings 22:28,"Mikhayhu said:
If you return, yes, return in peace,
Y<small>HWH</small> has not spoken through me!
And he said:
Hearken, O peoples, all of them …"
I Kings 22:29,The king of Israel and Yehoshafat king of Judah went up to Ramot-Gil’ad.
I Kings 22:30,"And the king of Israel said to Yehoshafat:
[I] will disguise [myself] and come to battle,
but you, clothe yourself in your [royal] garments.
So the king of Israel disguised himself and came to battle."
I Kings 22:31,"Now the king of Aram had charged the chariot officers belonging to him,
thirty-two, saying:
You are not to engage in battle with anyone from small to great,
except with the king of Israel alone!"
I Kings 22:32,"And it was, when the chariot officers saw Yehoshafat,
that they said:
Surely he is the king of Israel!
So they turned toward him, to do battle,
and Yehoshafat cried out [for help]."
I Kings 22:33,"But it was, when the chariot officers saw that he was not the king of Israel,
that they turned away from him."
I Kings 22:34,"Now a man drew his bow in his innocence
and struck the king of Israel between the connecting-plates and the armor.
He said to his chariot driver:
Reverse your hand and take me out of the camp,
for I have been wounded!"
I Kings 22:35,"The battle heightened on that day,
and the king was stood up in the chariot, facing Aram.
He died at sunset, with the blood of his wound pouring into the lap of the chariot."
I Kings 22:36,"And a ringing-cry passed through the camp as the sun was coming in, saying:
Each one to his town! Each one to his land!"
I Kings 22:37,"So the king died and was brought to Shomeron,
and they buried the king in Shomeron."
I Kings 22:38,"The chariot was rinsed off by the Pool of Shomeron;
the dogs licked up his blood,
and whores bathed [in it],
according to the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had spoken."
I Kings 22:39,"Now the rest of the events of Ah’av, and all that he did,
and the house of ivory that he built
and all the towns that he built—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
I Kings 22:40,"Ah’av lay beside his fathers,
and Ahazyahu his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 22:41,"Now Yehoshafat son of Asa became king over Judah
in year four of Ah’av king of Israel."
I Kings 22:42,"Yehoshafat was thirty-five years old at his becoming king,
and for twenty-five years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Azuva daughter of Shilhi."
I Kings 22:43,"And he walked in all the way of Asa his father;
he did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 22:44,"However, the sanctuaries were not removed—
the people were still offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke at the sanctuaries."
I Kings 22:45,And Yehoshafat made peace with the king of Israel.
I Kings 22:46,"Now the rest of the events of Yehoshafat and his mighty-deeds that he did, and how he waged battle—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
I Kings 22:47,"And the rest of the [male] prostitutes who were left in the days of Asa his father
he eradicated from the land."
I Kings 22:48,"Now king there was none in Edom;
a prefect reigned as king."
I Kings 22:49,"And Yehoshafat had made ships of Tarshish for going to Ofir, for gold,
but they did not go,
because the ships broke apart at Etzyon-Gever."
I Kings 22:50,"It was then that Ahazyahu son of Ah’av had said to Yehoshafat:
Let my servants go with your servants aboard the ships!
But Yehoshafat had not consented."
I Kings 22:51,"Yehoshafat lay beside his fathers;
he was buried with his fathers
in the city of David his father,
and Yehoram his son reigned as king in his place."
I Kings 22:52,"Ahazyahu son of Ah’av became king over Israel in Shomeron
in year seventeen of Yehoshafat king of Judah;
he reigned as king over Israel for two years."
I Kings 22:53,"And he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH:</small>
he walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother,
and in the way of Yorov’am son of Nevat,
who had caused Israel to sin;"
I Kings 22:54,"he served Baal and bowed down to him
and provoked Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel,
exactly as his father had done."
I Kings 22:55,Y<small>HWH</small>: Following ancient manuscripts and versions; MT has “the Lord.”
