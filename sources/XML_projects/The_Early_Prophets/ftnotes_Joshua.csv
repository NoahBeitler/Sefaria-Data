Joshua 1:1,"<b>Moshe:</b> Pronounced <i>mo-SHEH;</i> traditional English “Moses.” <b>Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> As explained above in “On Using This Book,” the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, whose pronunciation is not precisely known, is traditionally transcribed as “the Lord.” Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it (other possibilities include “the Eternal,” <i>“Adonai,”</i> etc.). <b>the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The use of this title links the beginning of Joshua to the conclusion of Deuteronomy (34:5), emphasizing the unbroken continuity between Moshe and his successor. The term is also attached to David and some of the kings of Judah who followed him, indicating the concept of the sacred task of the biblical leader (Gray 1986). Regarding Moshe it is used fourteen times in the book of Joshua, a significant patterned number (two times seven). <b>Yehoshua:</b> Pronounced <i>yeho-SHOO-ah;</i> trad. English “Joshua.” <b>the attendant of Moshe:</b> Yehoshua’s title already when we first meet him in Exod. 24:13."
Joshua 1:2,"<b>arise, cross:</b> Kimhi understands this (starting with Heb. <i>q-y-m</i>) in the spirit of “go cross,” or “go ahead and cross.”"
Joshua 1:3,"<b>Every place … to you I have given it:</b> This probably reflects an ancient legal practice of walking out a boundary to establish ownership of territory; see also Gen. 1:14–17, where God has Avraham do the same (Fishbane). The repetition of “give” in the chapter emphasizes that, in ancient legal language, this is a land grant."
Joshua 1:4,"<b>this Levanon:</b> Pronounced <i>leh-vah-NOHN;</i> trad. English “Lebanon,” the “white” mountain range to the north of Israel, from which the present-day country derives its name. <b>the land of the Hittites:</b> Most of the references to “Hittites” in the Bible, and Assyrian documents, seem to refer to a localized Canaanite group, which may or may not be related to the more prominent Hittite kingdoms farther north. <b>the Great Sea:</b> The Mediterranean. <b>territory:</b> Heb. <i>gevul</i> can also, as often throughout the book, mean “border, boundary.”"
Joshua 1:5,<b>No man will stand up before you:</b> No one will be able to stand against you. <b>not desert you … not abandon you:</b> A new expression of God’s reassurance; Moshe had been told on several occasions that “I will be with you.”
Joshua 1:6,"<b>Be strong and courageous:</b> Heb. <i>hazak ve-ematz</i>. As God has already said to Moshe in Deut. 31:; Moshe, in turn, similarly exhorts both people and Yehoshua in 31:7 and 23."
Joshua 1:7,"<b>to take care to observe:</b> Another phrase which echoes Deuteronomy (for example, in 31:6)."
Joshua 1:8,"<b>Record of the Instruction:</b> Heb. <i>sefer ha-tora</i>. It is not clear what is meant here; at this point in the Bible, the phrase does not refer to the Five Books of Moses, as it commonly does later. The word <i>sefer</i>, used to mean “book” in later centuries, in the Bible can cover all kinds of written documents. <b>recite:</b> Heb. <i>h-g-h</i> indicates a low murmur, in the oral style of ancient study (see also Ps. 1:2)."
Joshua 1:9,<b>be dismayed:</b> Or “be shattered.”
Joshua 1:10,"<b>three days:</b> The same period of preparation, known in Canaanite texts, preceded the meeting between God and Israel at Mount Sinai in Exod. 19. <b>take possession:</b> This verb (Heb. <i>y-r-sh</i>), which can sometimes mean “dispossess,” weaves throughout the book. In simplest form, it underlines “the juridical right to land by virtue of conquest” (Mitchell)."
Joshua 1:11,"<b>Re’uvenites … Gadites … half tribe of Menashe:</b> “Re’uven” (pronounced <i>re-oo-VANE</i>) is trad. English “Reuben,” while “Menashe” (pronounced <i>me-nah-SHEH</i>) is “Manasseh.” These three groups, back in Num. 32, had requested that they be permitted to settle on the east bank of the Jordan. There they agreed to participate with their fellow Israelites in the conquest of Canaan (on the West Bank)."
Joshua 1:12,"<b>the word:</b> Although the text reflects the gist of Num. 32, the words attributed to Moshe here do not appear verbatim in Numbers."
Joshua 1:13,"<b>wives … little-ones … livestock:</b> The usual components taken as the spoils of war; see Deut. 20:. “Little-ones,” Heb. <i>taf</i>, may also have the wider connotation of “stragglers,” thus including the infirm and the aged."
Joshua 1:14,<b>at the rising-place of the sun:</b> A common biblical idiom for “in/toward the east.”
Joshua 1:15,"<b>we will do:</b> Echoing, once again, the scene at Sinai in Exod. 19:8. Note the portrayal of Israel as a unified nation."
Joshua 1:16,"<b>your orders:</b> Literally, “your mouth.”"
Joshua 2:1,"<b>Shittim:</b> The word, pronounced <i>shee-TEEM</i>, denotes acacia trees. <b>Jericho:</b> Heb. <i>yeriho</i>. One of the oldest cities in the world, it lies near the Dead Sea, with the surrounding hills rising several thousand feet toward the central plateau of Judah. <b>whore:</b> Traditional commentaries, following the Targum, have sought to soften this word, understanding it as “innkeeper,” but its usual meaning in the Bible is indeed “prostitute,” and that interpretation is more in keeping with the common motif of God working through less-than-heroic types (see Commentary). In the real world of the ancient Near East, as recorded in the much earlier Hammurabi Code, the location of an inn/brothel in a defensive wall was mentioned as a security risk (Weinfeld 1993). <b>Rahav:</b> Pronounced <i>rah-HAV</i>); trad. English “Rahab.” The name resembles a verb that means “to widen.”"
Joshua 2:2,"<b>The king … was told:</b> Possibly by guards, who would be observing the traffic in and out of the city, or else by one of Rahav’s customers."
Joshua 2:3,<b>then she said:</b> To the king’s men.
Joshua 2:4,"<b>flax … roof:</b> The flat roof, a useful work space in biblical-era houses, was often used for drying and processing grain."
Joshua 2:5,<b>the men:</b> The king’s men. <b>they closed:</b> The townspeople.
Joshua 2:6,<b><i>she:</i></b> The emphasis points out her energy (Hawk 2000).
Joshua 2:7,"<b>dread of you:</b> Foreigners’ fear of the Israelites is a favorite motif in the Five Books of Moses; see, for example, Exod. 15:14–16."
Joshua 2:8,"<b>Amorite:</b> Used here to denote Israel’s neighbors east of the Jordan, but more often referring to the inhabitants of Canaan in general, or occasionally to those dwelling in the highlands. <b>Sihon … Og:</b> Pronounced <i>see-HONE</i> and <i>OG</i> (with “o” as in “old”). See Num. 21:21–35, where the Israelites encounter and defeat these two kings east of the Jordan. They are subsequently used as examples in narrating God’s great deeds on Israel’s behalf. <b>devoted-to-destruction:</b> This term (Hebrew root <i>h-r-m</i>), used frequently in Joshua, indicates people, animals, or objects set aside exclusively for God, often meaning wholesale destruction or death. Israel’s Moabite neighbors also spoke of <i>herem</i> in respect to their national god Kemosh, in the Mesha Stele (“Moabite Stone,” discovered in Jordan in 1868). The word appears in Arabic and has entered English as “harem,” signifying a group of women set apart for one man."
Joshua 2:9,<b>our hearts melted [in fear]:</b> JPS: “we lost heart.”
Joshua 2:10,"<b>Father’s House:</b> A social unit in ancient Israel, much like an extended family.
12–13 <b>swear to me … :</b> Rahav’s motivation in all this seems to be her safety and that of her family."
Joshua 2:11,"<b>in the wall she dwelt:</b> The location of Rahav’s house made it the perfect entry and escape spot for the spies. A casemate structure, featuring double walls (note the two different words for “wall” in the text) that allowed soldiers to be posted inside, was an architectural feature known to generations of Israelites in biblical times."
Joshua 2:12,"<b>We are clear:</b> Meaning, “We will be guiltless if you violate the terms of our agreement, and you’ll die like all the other inhabitants of Jericho.”"
Joshua 2:13,"<b>cord:</b> As Hawk (2000) notes, Heb. <i>tikva</i> also means “hope.” <b>scarlet thread:</b> Clearly noticeable from a distance, this is analogous to the blood marking the Israelites’ doors in the Exodus story. It is used elsewhere in purification rituals (see Lev. 14:4, 6, and Num. 19:6)."
Joshua 2:14,"<b>In accordance with your words, so be it!:</b> Her words seal the deal."
Joshua 2:15,"<b>Yehoshua son of Nun:</b> His full name had appeared in v.1, and thus brackets the whole story nicely (Meyers 2004)."
Joshua 3:1,
Joshua 3:2,
Joshua 3:3,"<b>Coffer of the Covenant:</b> Ancient Israel’s central cultic object, this chest (trad. English “Ark”) contained the tablets on which the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20) were written. See Exod. 25:1–22 for a full description. <b>the priests and the Levites:</b> Others, “the Levitical priests.” The term is problematic; given that it is hardly used in the subsequent books of the Early Prophets, it may indicate a southern (Jerusalem) writer’s bias against Levites (Boling 1982)."
Joshua 3:4,"<b>let it be far:</b> Proper distance from holy objects must be observed, lest one incur divine wrath. <b>two thousand cubits:</b> Biblical cubits measured from eighteen to twenty-two inches, so the distance in question would have been half a mile or more. <b>go:</b> Or “walk.” <b>yesterday [or] the day-before:</b> An idiom meaning “the past.”"
Joshua 3:5,"<b>Make yourselves holy:</b> That is, put yourselves in a state of ritual purity, by washing yourselves and abstaining from sexual relations. The same had been required of the people at Sinai (Exod. 19)."
Joshua 3:6,<b>Carry … Coffer … Covenant:</b> The Hebrew is not alliterative.
Joshua 3:7,"<b>you are to stand-still:</b> Or “stop.” The reader does not yet know why, but it clearly anticipates something dramatic."
Joshua 3:8,"<b>By this you shall know:</b> A dramatic phrase, used elsewhere only in the story of Korah (Num. 16:28) (Boling 1982). <b>the Living God:</b> Heb. <i>elohim hayyim</i>. The phrase probably carries the connotation of “active,” “vital”; I could not find an adequate English translation. <b>the Canaanite … :</b> An enumeration of indigenous “nations” which, in one form or another, occurs frequently in the Five Books of Moses. See Gen. 15:19 for the first such list. <b>Yevusite:</b> Trad. English “Jebusite.”"
Joshua 3:9,"<b>coming down:</b> Heb. <i>ha-yoredim</i>, echoing the name of the river Jordan (Heb. <i>Yarden</i>, “The Descender”). <b>heap:</b> Used elsewhere only regarding the crossing of the Sea of Reeds in Exod. 15:8 (Meyers 2004)."
Joshua 3:10,"<b>the days of the harvest-cutting:</b> In the spring, after the yearly rains have stopped, and extending into early summer. The waters would then be high, making the crossing more difficult and thus miraculous."
Joshua 3:11,"<b>Adam … Tzaretan:</b> Location unclear. <b>the Sea of the Plain, the Sea of Salt:</b> The Dead Sea."
Joshua 3:12,<b>nation:</b> A term (Heb. <i>goy</i>) rarely used of Israel; more common is the kinship-based term “people” (<i>’am</i>). Its usage here suggests that the crossing of the Jordan is an act of nation-founding.
Joshua 4:1,
Joshua 4:2,
Joshua 4:3,<b>firmstanding:</b> Not connected in Hebrew to the recurring “stand [still].”
Joshua 4:4,"<b>What are these stones to you?:</b> That is, what do they mean to you?"
Joshua 4:5,"<b>these stones are to be a reminder:</b> This function is a common one in the Bible; see Gen. 28:18, where the stone that serves as Yaakov’s pillow becomes a “standing-pillar,” marking a holy or memorable spot."
Joshua 4:6,"<b>until this day:</b> An important phrase in DH, occurring fully fifteen times in Joshua. Some scholars see it as confirming that such traditions are preexilic (see Geoghegan)."
Joshua 4:7,<b>armed:</b> Boling (1982): “in battle array.”
Joshua 4:8,"<b>units:</b> Agreeing with a number of scholars, Boling (1982) included, who understand the word <i>elef</i> as a military “contingent,” thus reducing the numbers drastically in these stories. The same reduction may be true for the Torah’s enumeration of those who left Egypt, which at first blush indicates over six hundred thousand warriors. <b>specially-drafted:</b> Possibly, selected (Heb. <i>h-l-tz</i>, “removed”) from among the normal soldiers."
Joshua 4:9,<b>Testimony:</b> Another word for the covenant.
Joshua 4:10,"<b>on the tenth:</b> This seems to be an intentional allusion to the fact that the Israelites in Exodus had been commanded to take a lamb on the tenth day of the same month, in celebrating the first Passover (Fishbane). <b>the first month:</b> Corresponding to March or April. <b>Gilgal:</b> Likely located not far from Jericho (although a number of biblical towns have the same name), this was an important cultic center in early biblical times."
Joshua 4:11,<b>hold … in awe:</b> Trad. “fear.” Boling (1982) posits a more political meaning to the phrase: “give allegiance.” See v.14 above.
Joshua 5:1,
Joshua 5:2,"<b>knives:</b> The Hebrew word usually means “swords.” Flint may be used here because of its primitive, i.e., nontechnological, associations. It may be more precisely identified as obsidian, a stone known for smoothness and sharpness (Hess). <b>a second time:</b> Meaning the new generation, as explained in the subsequent verses."
Joshua 5:3,<b>matter:</b> JPS (following Kimhi): “reason.”
Joshua 5:4,"<b>them:</b> So several manuscripts; MT (the standard Hebrew text) reads “us.” <b>flowing with milk and honey:</b> The land’s richness is so described for the first time in Exod. 3:8. The milk is likely that of goats; while it was long considered that the “honey” referred to the syrup of dates, recent discoveries point to some domestication of bees in ancient Israel. In Canaanite poetry, the parallel phrase is “fatness and honey.”"
Joshua 5:5,"<b>recovery:</b> Lit., “living [again],” “reviving.”"
Joshua 5:6,"<b>the disgrace of Egypt:</b> Usually understood as the stigma of slavery; Hess sees it as symbolizing the disobedience of the slave generation.
10–11 <b>sunset … Plains … yield:</b> Hawk (2000) notes the Hebrew play on words of the three nouns: <i>’erev … ’arevot … ’avur</i>. The main root signifies “crossing.”"
Joshua 5:7,"<b>parched grain:</b> Typifying simple, easily obtained food. The list here anticipates the bounty of the Promised Land, in a kind of “down payment” (Hess). <b>this:</b> We might expect “that” here; it sounds like an audience is being addressed."
Joshua 5:8,"<b><i>mahn:</i></b> The miraculous food sent by God in Exod. 16:14, which sustained the Israelites in the wilderness. Trad. English “manna.”"
Joshua 5:9,<b>at:</b> Or “by.”
Joshua 5:10,"<b>No:</b> Boling (1982) understands the Hebrew as “Neither one.” Another possibility is “[He said] to him,” as Heb. <i>lo’</i> and <i>lo</i> are homonyms. <b>bowed low:</b> Here, as often, biblical characters prostrate themselves “nostrils to the ground.”"
Joshua 5:11,<b>Put off your sandal … holy:</b> Echoing God’s words to Moshe at the burning bush (Exod. 3:5).
Joshua 6:1,<b>closed up and was dosed-up-tight:</b> Heb. <i>sogeret u-m’suggeret</i>.
Joshua 6:2,<b>into your hand:</b> A parallel expression exists in Akkadian (Boling 198).
Joshua 6:3,<b>You:</b> Plural.
Joshua 6:4,"<b>seven priests … seven <i>shofars</i> … seventh day … seven times:</b> Throughout the ancient Near East, this number connotes completeness and perfection. <b><i>shofars:</i></b> Rams’ horns, which have both military and religious functions in the Bible."
Joshua 6:5,<b>from below:</b> Collapsing by its own weight.
Joshua 6:6,"<b>the gathering-up [unit]:</b> Those who “mop up.” Others, “rearguard.”"
Joshua 6:7,"<b>going, going along:</b> As in a procession (Boling 1982)."
Joshua 6:8,"<b>devoted-things:</b> These were to be quarantined for God, as it were, and hence not subject to human use. See the note to 2:10, above. Nelson uses of the term “taboo,” and notes how a kind of contagion is involved. <b>feel desire:</b> MT has “devoted-to-destruction” (Hebrew root <i>h-r-m</i>) here; more likely is the root <i>h-m-d</i> (the “covet” or “desire” of the tenth commandment), as reflected in LXX. The letters <i>resh</i> and <i>dalet</i> are easily confused in Hebrew script, and the switching of two adjacent letters (<i>dalet</i> and <i>mem</i>) is a common scribal error, termed metathesis. <b>disaster:</b> Such a violation would anger God."
Joshua 6:9,"<b>the two men, those spying:</b> Whom we met in Chap. 2."
Joshua 6:10,"<b>clan:</b> Following LXX; MT uses the plural. <b>outside the camp of Israel:</b> This isolation of Rahav and her family seems to be only temporary, since in v.25 they come to reside “in the midst of Israel.”"
Joshua 6:11,"<b>the house of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Although in the Bible this phrase usually refers to Shelomo’s (Solomon’s) Temple, here it undoubtedly means a tent-sanctuary, specifically the one at Shilo (see I Sam. 1:)."
Joshua 6:12,<b>with … with:</b> Most interpreters understand this “with” as meaning that the builder will pay with the lives of his sons. The prophecy is fulfilled in I Kings 16:34.
Joshua 6:13,<b>report:</b> From the Hebrew verb that means “to hear.”
Joshua 7:1,<b>Akhan:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-KHAN;</i> trad. English “Achan.”
Joshua 7:2,"<b>Ai/The Ruin:</b> Usually identified as Et-Tell, just southeast of Bet-El. <b>Bet-Aven:</b> All names beginning with Heb. “Bet” (house), pronounced “bayt,” in this translation are “Beth” in trad. English."
Joshua 7:3,<b>they are few:</b> The inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua 7:4,<b>Broken-Places:</b> Probably remains created by repeated destructions of the site. <b>melted:</b> Used previously to describe the fear felt by the Canaanites at the Israelites’ advance.
Joshua 7:5,"<b>tore his clothes … tossed earth:</b> Israelite mourning practices; see, for instance, Gen. 37:34."
Joshua 7:6,<b>turned the back-of-its-neck:</b> A gesture of submission.
Joshua 7:7,<b>reverse course against us:</b> Turn and be able to defeat us. <b>name:</b> Meaning “reputation.”
Joshua 7:8,<b>Arise:</b> Meant quite literally here; “Get up!”
Joshua 7:9,<b>yes:</b> The repetition of Heb. <i>gam</i> builds up the effect of the crime in a wave of sound. <b>among their vessels:</b> Thus hiding them.
Joshua 7:10,"<b>liable-to-destruction:</b> By stealing from what was banned, they themselves have become banned."
Joshua 7:11,<b>captures-by-lot:</b> The same Hebrew root (<i>l-k-d</i>) frequently used in the book to indicate conquest.
Joshua 7:12,"<b>all who belong to him:</b> A man’s household—his family and possessions—was considered an extension of his person. <b>crossed:</b> Broke, violated; the English “transgressed” (from Latin) is an exact equivalent. <b>a vile-thing:</b> A term (Heb. <i>nevala</i>) used to describe a terrible deed, often (but not necessarily) rape (see Gen. 34:7)."
Joshua 7:13,<b>Zarhite:</b> Descended from one named Zerah.
Joshua 7:14,"<b>house:</b> Denoting an extended family, sometimes called a “Father’s House” in the Bible."
Joshua 7:15,"<b>now give glory:</b> Gray 86 suggests “acknowledge the weightiness [of your crime].” <b>make confession to him:</b> As JPS; others, “give him praise.”"
Joshua 7:16,<b>like this and like that:</b> Meaning “as follows.”
Joshua 7:17,"<b>Shin’ar:</b> Babylonia. It is not clear what kind of robe the text is describing. Such geographical names for clothing appear elsewhere in the ancient Near East. <b>ingot:</b> The English word has a parallel derivation to the Heb. <i>lashon</i>, “tongue.” <b>hidden:</b> The concealment makes the crime all the worse—and in a parallel sense, the name/identity “Canaan” (<i>k-n-’-n</i>) is hidden in Akhan’s own name (<i>’-k-n</i>)! (Hawk 2000)."
Joshua 7:18,"<b>Then Yehoshua took Akhan:</b> The “taking” is now, ironically, a sign of Akhan’s impending death (Mitchell). <b>Akhor/Disaster:</b> Or “trouble,” which in current English seems too mild. JPS uses “calamity.”"
Joshua 7:19,<b>pelted him with stones</b>: A well-known ancient form of execution.
Joshua 8:1,<b>do not be dismayed:</b> Back to the confidence level of Chap. 1 (see v.9 there).
Joshua 8:2,"<b>thirty thousand:</b> Or perhaps, as earlier, thirty units or groups."
Joshua 8:3,"<b>as at the beginning:</b> The first battle, recounted in Chap. 7."
Joshua 8:4,<b>take possession:</b> Heb. <i>yirash;</i> LXX has “approach” (<i>yiggash</i>).
Joshua 8:5,"<b>seaward:</b> Westward, in the direction of the Mediterranean."
Joshua 8:6,"<b>people for battle:</b> The English is as awkward as the Hebrew. Some scholars omit “for battle,” since “people” here, as often, can mean “soldiers” (see “fighting-people” in v.10)."
Joshua 8:7,<b>fighting-people:</b> Reading <i>ha-’am</i> for MT <i>ha-’emek</i> (“the valley”). <b>lodged:</b> Most manuscripts read “went” here.
Joshua 8:8,<b>of the wilderness:</b> Or “to the wilderness.”
Joshua 8:9,"<b>remained:</b> Or “was left,” but changed here so as not to be identical to the different verb in the next phrase, “they left the city open.”"
Joshua 8:10,<b>scimitar:</b> A curved sword. <b>it:</b> The city.
Joshua 8:11,"<b>turned back upon:</b> Alternatively, “turned into” (Friedman)."
Joshua 8:12,<b>These:</b> The men of the city.
Joshua 8:13,<b>gone:</b> In the sense of “finished off.”
Joshua 8:14,"<b>an everlasting mound:</b> Like Jericho, Ai was not to be rebuilt. “Mound” implies a ruined heap."
Joshua 8:15,"<b>hung him on a wooden-stake:</b> This practice, possibly impalement, would take place after the actual killing, and was intended to further humiliate the victim. <b>until … sunset:</b> In accordance with the law in Deut. 21:23, a criminal’s body was not to be left out overnight."
Joshua 8:16,"<b>Then:</b> or “This was when” (Rösel). <b>Mount Eval:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-VAHL;</i> trad. English “Ebal,” the northern of the two large hills which overlook the city of Shekhem (modern Nablus). The other was Mount Gerizim, mentioned in v.33 below."
Joshua 8:17,"<b>complete:</b> Unhewn, not cut by metal. <b>no iron:</b> Continuing the traditional avoidance of iron. <b><i>shalom</i>-offerings:</b> Scholars disagree about the meaning of Heb. <i>shelamim</i>. Some see the sacrifice as a “gift-of-greeting,” others as a “peace-offering”; equally possible is a “sacrifice of solidarity,” since the <i>shelamim</i> usually involve a sacred meal. I have kept <i>shalom</i> (peace, greeting, wholeness), to leave all of these possibilities open."
Joshua 8:18,<b>the sojourner:</b> The noncitizen or foreigner.
Joshua 8:19,<b>the blessing and the curse:</b> A reenactment from Deut. 27.
Joshua 9:1,<b>across the Jordan:</b> West of the river.
Joshua 9:2,"<b>[under] one command:</b> Following Boling (198); lit., “with one mouth.”"
Joshua 9:3,<b>Giv’on:</b> Pronounced <i>giv-OHN;</i> trad. English “Gibeon.”
Joshua 9:4,"<b>for their part:</b> So JPS; others, “they too,” which is unclear. <b>supplied themselves:</b> MT has “went as a delegation,” but see v.12 in the text."
Joshua 9:5,"<b>cut a covenant:</b> See Gen. 15:10 for a memorable example of taking the verb literally. In a practice that is attested in the Aramaic Sefire treaty, the parties to such an agreement would walk between cut-up animals, implying a similar fate if one of them were to break the agreement in the future."
Joshua 9:6,"<b>how can I cut … :</b> Given the command to annihilate the locals (Deut. :1–2), such a treaty would be impermissible."
Joshua 9:7,<b>We are:</b> Or “we will be.”
Joshua 9:8,<b>This our bread:</b> A northern idiom (Rendsburg 2003).
Joshua 9:9,<b>The men:</b> The Israelites. <b>took from their supplies:</b> There are several possibilities here. Boling (1982) suggests the context of a covenant meal; JPS reads “took [their word] because of their provisions.” <b>did not inquire:</b> Did not consult an oracle.
Joshua 9:10,<b>letting them live:</b> Paralleling Rahav in 6:25.
Joshua 9:11,"<b>Giv’on … :</b> Indeed, not far away, just five and a half miles from Jerusalem."
Joshua 9:12,"<b>the entire community:</b> Probably referring to a kind of representative body. <b>grumbled:</b> The verb (<i>l-w-n</i>) is otherwise used mainly in the rebellion stories of the book of Numbers, beginning with Chap. 11."
Joshua 9:13,"<b>harm:</b> Or “attack, touch.”"
Joshua 9:14,<b>fury:</b> Here describing divine anger over the breaking of a solemn agreement.
Joshua 9:15,"<b>never … cut off … :</b> That is, there will always be a servant. <b>servant:</b> See above note to 1:1. The Heb. <i>’eved</i> has a broad range of meanings, also including “vassal,” “slave,” and “worshipper” of a deity. <b>house of … God:</b> See note to 6:24, above."
Joshua 9:16,"<b>at the place that he chooses:</b> A classic Deuteronomic phrase, taken by many to refer to Jerusalem."
Joshua 10:1,"<b>Adoni-Tzedek:</b> The name means “My Lord Is Tzedek” (an Amorite god) or, more literally, “My Lord is Legitimacy,” as opposed to being a usurper. <b>Jerusalem:</b> The original meaning is likely “City of [the god] Shalem.” The name later came to be understood as “City of Peace” or “Safety” (<i>shalom</i>)."
Joshua 10:2,<b>mighty ones:</b> Boling (198): “knights.”
Joshua 10:3,"<b>Hevron:</b> Pronounced <i>hev-RONE</i>. Trad. English “Hebron,” it was located about nineteen miles southwest of Jerusalem. <b>Yarmut:</b> A town located a few miles north of Hevron. It and Eglon later in the verse are not mentioned again in the book. <b>Lakhish:</b> Pronounced <i>lah-KHEESH;</i> trad. English “Lachish,” the important Judean city about fifteen miles west of Hevron. It has been identified with Tell ed-Duweir. <b>Eglon:</b> A town in the lowlands; site identification not clear."
Joshua 10:4,"<b>and all the mighty-men:</b> Can also be read as “namely, all the mighty-men.”"
Joshua 10:5,<b>them:</b> The five Amorite kings.
Joshua 10:6,"<b>panicked:</b> A term often used of God’s fighting on behalf of the Israelites by inducing a kind of mass hysteria (e.g., Exod. 14:24, Deut. 7:23). The same verb is used in other ancient Near Eastern war accounts, with the warrior kings as the subject (Younger). <b>Pass:</b> Lit. “Ascent.” <b>Azeka … Makkeda:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-zay-KAH … mah-kay-DAH</i>."
Joshua 10:7,"<b>large stones from the heavens:</b> Hailstones are mentioned in other ancient Near Eastern battle accounts as having been sent by storm gods. “Large,” interestingly, does not appear in the extant Dead Sea Scroll manuscript of Joshua."
Joshua 10:8,"<b>still … Ayyalon:</b> The Hebrew is assonant (<i>dom … ayyalon</i>); for poetic effect in English, one could use “be still [as stone],” were it not for the presence of stones already in the chapter. The Hebrew verb (<i>d-m-m</i>) can connote both silence and immobility. Ayyalon was near Bet-Horon Pass."
Joshua 10:9,"<b>was avenged on:</b> The Hebrew nuance is difficult. Boling (1982) translates as “defeated,” but it may well indicate “getting satisfaction through the defeat of one’s enemy,” as in Judg. 16:28. <b>Record of the Upright:</b> Trad. English “the Book of Jashar.” The poetic form of the quotation from this lost work (see also II Sam. 1:18) suggests that it was an epic/poetic rendition of Israel’s history."
Joshua 10:10,<b>Y<small>HWH</small> to hearken to a man’s voice:</b> In order to intervene in nature.
Joshua 10:11,<b>And:</b> In the sense of “meanwhile” (JPS). <b>Makkeda:</b> Location unknown.
Joshua 10:12,<b>watch:</b> Or “guard.”
Joshua 10:13,<b>attack-their-tail:</b> Boling (82): “Cut off their retreat!” The Heb. verb derives from the noun “tail.”
Joshua 10:14,<b>survivors had escaped:</b> The Heb. uses one root here.
Joshua 10:15,"<b>wagged his tongue:</b> Some, “sharpened.” The image is used regarding the Exodus in Exod. 11:7, with a canine flavor."
Joshua 10:16,"<b>put your feet on the necks:</b> A known gesture of conquest in the ancient Near East. The Heb. <i>’oref</i> technically is the back of the neck, as I have put in translation elsewhere."
Joshua 10:17,"<b>until this very day:</b> See note to 4:9, above."
Joshua 10:18,"<b>as he had done to the king of Jericho:</b> That, however, is <i>not</i> recounted in the text. This kind of omission is often found in biblical narrative.
28–32 <b>as he had done … exactly as he had done:</b> The idea, using either one of these phrases, occurs seven times in this part of the text, stressing the campaign’s success (Meyers 2004)."
Joshua 10:19,"<b>Livna:</b> Another town of undetermined location, probably in the lowlands area."
Joshua 10:20,"<b>Kadesh-Barne’a:</b> Pronounced <i>kah-DAYSH bar-NAY-ah</i>, a site frequented by the Israelites during their earlier wilderness treks. It was the very southern boundary of Judah, the later Southern Kingdom. <b>Goshen:</b> Not to be confused with the Goshen of Exodus, the Israelites’ “neighborhood” in Egypt."
Joshua 11:1,<b>Yavin:</b> He appears again in Judg. 4. <b>Hatzor:</b> The large and important fortress city in the north of ancient Israel. <b>Madon … Shimron … Akhshaf:</b> Three other important towns in the north.
Joshua 11:2,"<b>in the north, in the highlands:</b> Or “in the north part of the highlands.” <b>south:</b> Hebrew uses the term <i>Negev</i>, the “arid” southland of Judah, as a directional term. <b>the Kinneret:</b> MT has “Kinarot.” In modern Israel it remains the name for the “lyre”-shaped Sea of Galilee. <b>the Heights of Dor:</b> A coastal town which has a long and distinguished history; in the later monarchy, it was eventually a district capital. Today it is the site of major ongoing archaeological excavations."
Joshua 11:3,"<b>toward sunrise and toward the Sea:</b> That is, east and west."
Joshua 11:4,<b>horse and chariot:</b> In contrast to the inferior Israelite foot soldiers (Meyers 200).
Joshua 11:5,<b>Merom:</b> In the vicinity of Tzefat (Safed).
Joshua 11:6,"<b>maim:</b> Usually taken to mean cutting the hamstring muscle; by the time of David, a less permanent maiming may have taken place (see note to II Sam. 8:4)."
Joshua 11:7,<b>fell upon them:</b> At this point LXX adds “from the mountain.”
Joshua 11:8,"<b>Greater Sidon:</b> The important port city, still prominent in today’s Lebanon."
Joshua 11:9,"<b>standing on their mounds:</b> Implying that the Israelites did not destroy some towns, but settled in them instead."

Joshua 11:11,"<b>the highlands of Israel and its lowlands:</b> Referring here to the northern region, later the kingdom of Israel; the “highlands” earlier belonged to Judah, the south."
Joshua 11:12,<b>Mount Halak:</b> The name connotes “smooth.”
Joshua 11:13,"<b>years:</b> Often the meaning of Heb. <i>yamim</i>, conventionally “days.” See, for instance, I Sam. 1:3, <i>mi-yamim yamima</i>, “from year to year” (annually)."
Joshua 11:14,"<b>it was from Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> It was Y<small>HWH</small>’s plan. <b>to make their heart strong-willed:</b> To make them stubborn, just as God had done to Pharaoh in the Exodus story."
Joshua 11:15,"<b>Anakites:</b> They were taken to be a race of giants and are referred to a number of times in relation to the conquest. <b>Judah … Israel:</b> Reflecting the later political division of the country into two kingdoms; here, it is either anachronistic or purely geographical."
Joshua 11:16,<b>Gaza … Gat … Ashdod:</b> Three of the five cities that come to be connected with the Philistines; the others were Ekron and Ashkelon.
Joshua 11:17,"<b>as hereditary-property:</b> Boling (1982): “in fief,” using a term from medieval Europe. The Hebrew root, <i>n-h-l</i>, has wider connotations than the generational transfer of property; it is closer to a property <i>claim</i> and is frequently paralleled with “share/allotment” (Hawk 2000, who suggests “legitimate share”)."
Joshua 12:1,<b>Wadi Arnon:</b> A stream which empties into the Dead Sea and creates a deep gorge; it served as a boundary between Re’uven in the north and Moav in the south. <b>all the Plain toward sunrise:</b> JPS: “The eastern half of the Arabah.”
Joshua 12:2,"<b>Gil’ad:</b> Trad. English “Gilead.” The territory across the Jordan, northeast of the Dead Sea. <b>Yabbok:</b> Pronounced <i>yah-BOKE;</i> trad. English “Jabbok,” the tributary of the Jordan which historically separated Ammon and the Gil’ad region."
Joshua 12:3,"<b>southward:</b> Here, and in 13:, the text uses a different term for “south” (<i>teiman</i>). <b>Pisga:</b> “Peak,” overlooking, from the east, the Jordan and indeed much of the land of Israel. The Bible marks it as the site of Moshe’s death. <b>the Refa’im/Shades:</b> Both in biblical and ancient Canaanite literature, the term <i>refa’im</i> refers to the spirits of dead ancestors, who in popular thinking are not only still active but quite powerful. Some scholars, on the other hand, simply understand them as huge, mighty warriors."
Joshua 12:4,"<b>Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The same Deuteronomistic phrase used of him at the beginning of the book."
Joshua 12:5,"<b>Lasharon:</b> Or “in Sharon”; LXX, on the other hand, reads the whole phrase as “Afek of the Sharon,” which parallels v.22’s “Yokne’am of the Carmel” (Rainey/Notley)."
Joshua 12:6,<b>Shimron Meron:</b> These may be two separate names.
Joshua 12:7,"<b>Megiddo:</b> The important strategic site at the western side of the Jezreel Valley, overlooking the road to the coastal plain, and hence the site of innumerable battles in antiquity."
Joshua 12:8,<b>Gilgal:</b> LXX reads “Galil” (Galilee) here.
Joshua 13:1,
Joshua 13:2,"<b>Geshurite [region]:</b> A small, often independent kingdom to the northeast of Israel (in today’s Golan Heights)."
Joshua 13:3,"<b>the Shihor:</b> The word means “lagoon” in Egyptian. <b>overlords:</b> The name used for Philistine rulers and, by extension, their cities."
Joshua 13:4,"<b>from ’Ara:</b> Location unknown, perhaps early on, leading to MT <i>me’ara</i>, “cave,” and LXX “from Gaza” (reflecting <i>me-’azza</i>)."
Joshua 13:5,"<b>the Giblite region:</b> Belonging to the Gebalites. The name refers to Byblos, a Phoenician seaport north of Sidon. <b>the Levanon:</b> JPS understands this as “the Valley” (of the Levanon)."
Joshua 13:6,<b>fall:</b> By lot.
Joshua 13:7,"<b>Menashe:</b> LXX follows this with “from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west you shall give it, the Great Sea being the border.”"
Joshua 13:8,<b>it:</b> The other half of the tribe of Menashe.
Joshua 13:9,"<b>middle of the wadi [valley]:</b> And not in the wadi itself, which at certain times of year would be running with water. <b>Medeva:</b> Pronounced <i>may-de-VAH;</i> trad. English “Medaba,” an oft-conquered town in Moabite territory, it is famous as the site of much later (sixth century <small>C.E.</small>) church mosaics that represent the earliest known map of sites in the land of Israel. NOTE: The many place-names that follow in these chapters are given in Hebrew forms, generally without traditional English equivalents in the Notes."
Joshua 13:10,"<b>fire-offerings:</b> Or “gifts.” In this verse the word is awkward, and probably a later insertion, since it is lacking in the exact parallel verse in 13:33. <b>it:</b> Or “concerning them” (JPS)."
Joshua 13:11,"<b>territory:</b> This is the same Hebrew word (<i>gevul</i>) that usually means “boundary, border” in Joshua. See also v.25, 18:11, and 19:18."
Joshua 13:12,<b>Kiryatayim:</b> Meaning “twin cities.”
Joshua 13:13,"<b>Bet-Ha-Yeshimmot:</b> “The House of Wastelands,” an appropriate name for a location at the Dead Sea (Boling 1982)."
Joshua 13:14,<b>chiefs:</b> Some understand as “vassals.”
Joshua 13:15,"<b>while Bil’am … :</b> See the famous story of Bil’am (Balaam), who was hired to curse the Israelites, in Num. –24. Here he is dismissed as a mere “soothsayer” (Heb. <i>kosem</i>), as part of the negative reassessment of him in such passages as Num. 31:8, 16, Deut. 23:5–6, and Josh. 24:9–10."
Joshua 13:16,"<b>farmsteads:</b> Others, “villages.”"
Joshua 13:17,"<b>Lo-Devar:</b> As per II Sam. 9:4 and 17:27; MT has “Lidvir,” “belonging to Devir.”"
Joshua 13:18,<b>for the half group:</b> Here a different word (<i>matteh</i>) is used than the usual one for “tribe” (<i>shevet</i>).
Joshua 13:19,<b>Moav:</b> Trad. English “Moab.”
Joshua 14:1,"<b>these:</b> The parcels of land. <b>El’azar:</b> Trad. English “Eleazar,” the High Priest and son of Aharon (Aaron). The book will end with his death and burial. <b>Fathers:</b> In this context, the word indicates clans or extended families."
Joshua 14:2,"<b>Levites … not given hereditary-property:</b> As specified in the Torah, for instance in Deut. 18:1–2."
Joshua 14:3,<b>pasture-lands:</b> Or “grazing lands.” <b>acquisitions:</b> Other livestock.
Joshua 14:4,"<b>Yehuda:</b> Pronounced <i>ye-hoo-DAH;</i> trad. English “Judah.” <b>Calev:</b> Pronounced <i>kah-LAVE;</i> trad. English “Caleb.” Along with Yehoshua, he was the only other optimistic spy of Num. 14. They alone survive of the generation whose lack of trust in Y<small>HWH</small> resulted in their dying out in the wilderness, before the book of Joshua begins. <b>Kenizzite:</b> A non-Israelite group later absorbed into the tribe of Yehuda (Meyers 2004). <b>regarding you:</b> Plural."
Joshua 14:5,"<b>just as was in my heart:</b> Heb. “with my heart”—a true, honest report, along with that of Yehoshua himself, unlike the panic-stricken account of the ten other spies."
Joshua 14:6,"<b>melted the heart of the people [with fear]:</b> That is, discouraged them from going up to conquer the land. <b>fully-followed after:</b> The verb stem connotes “fullness”; JPS: “was loyal to.”"
Joshua 14:7,"<b>If the land … does not … :</b> This “incomplete oath” construction, common in biblical Hebrew, implies that if something is not true, “may such and such happen to me.”"
Joshua 14:8,<b>for going out and for coming in:</b> A biblical expression often denoting leading the troops.
Joshua 14:9,"<b>he was:</b> Namely, Arba."
Joshua 15:1,"<b>Edom:</b> The area south and slightly east of the Dead Sea, it is in southwestern Jordan today. <b>Wilderness of Tzyn:</b> In northeastern Sinai, south of the Negev."
Joshua 15:2,<b>the “tongue”:</b> The bay.
Joshua 15:3,"<b>Then:</b> Multiple times in this chapter I have rendered Heb. <i>vav</i> as “then” rather than as “and,” to convey the running descriptive flavor of the drawing of borders. <b>south of:</b> Heb. <i>negev;</i> LXX reads “opposite” (<i>neged</i>). <b>Scorpions’ Pass:</b> Lit. “Scorpions’ Ascent.” See Num. 4:4."
Joshua 15:4,"<b>Wadi of Egypt:</b> The present-day Wadi El-Arish, south of Gaza."
Joshua 15:5,"<b>edge:</b> The mouth of the Jordan, at the Dead Sea."
Joshua 15:6,<b>Stone of Bohan:</b> Possibly meaning a “thumb-shaped” stone.
Joshua 15:7,"<b>Valley of Disaster:</b> See Chap. , above. <b>Gilgal:</b> Not necessarily the prominent Gilgal of earlier in the book. A number of place-names are used for multiple sites in the Bible; another example would be Afek."
Joshua 15:8,"<b>the Ravine of the Son of Hinnom:</b> Or “of Ben Hinnom.” This valley, immediately south of today’s Old City of Jerusalem, came to be associated with the once-burning fires of child sacrifice (see II Kings 23:10). Jeremiah (7:31–32) saw it as the place of ultimate punishment, and in this sense, the Hebrew name for the valley, <i>Gei-Hinnom</i>, passed into later Judaism (and Christianity and Islam as well) as <i>Gehinnom or Gehenna</i>, “Hell.” <b>shoulder:</b> This anatomical term connotes “ridge.”"
Joshua 15:9,"<b>diverges:</b> or “veers off.” The syntactical form of the Hebrew verb, which itself occurs only in Joshua, suggests a late usage (Rainey/Notley). <b>Waters of Neftoah:</b> ’Ain Lifta, near the northwestern edge of Jerusalem today. <b>towns:</b> LXX has “ruins.”"
Joshua 15:10,"<b>those born of:</b> Boling (1982) theorizes that this indicates not biological ties but rather some form of military initiation. JPS, on the other hand, uses “descendants of.”"
Joshua 15:11,<b>Kiryat-Sefer:</b> “City of Documents/Records.”
Joshua 15:12,<b>brother:</b> The word can carry the meaning of kinsman as well as sibling. <b>Akhsa:</b> Pronounced <i>akh-SAH;</i> trad. English “Achsah.”
Joshua 15:13,"<b>she induced him:</b> LXX indicates that he is the active party, but see the repeated story in Judg. 1:14, where MT (with Akhsa as the active chief actor) makes more sense. <b>field:</b> A fertile one."
Joshua 15:14,"<b>arid land:</b> Or “the Southland” (Heb. <i>negev</i>). JPS understands the expression as referring to Akhsa herself, namely, a woman without a dowry."
Joshua 15:15,"<b>Hatzar-Yitnan:</b> MT has “Hatzar and Yitnan,” but the former grammatically needs to be connected with the latter, as in the examples from vv.27 and 28."
Joshua 15:16,"<b>Bizyotya:</b> LXX reads this as <i>u-v’noteha</i>, “and its daughter-towns,” a common term in these texts for “dependencies” (Boling 1982)."
Joshua 15:17,"<b>Rimmon Spring:</b> Again following LXX, which reads <i>’Ayin Rimmon</i> as <i>’En Rimmon</i>, “Pomegranate Spring.”"
Joshua 15:18,<b>fourteen:</b> The list from vv.33 to  actually includes fifteen towns; medieval Jewish commentators attempted to solve the problem by reducing two of the towns to one.
Joshua 15:19,<b>and their farmsteads:</b> This phrase is followed in LXX by a list of eleven towns situated south of Jerusalem.
Joshua 16:1,<b>Yosef:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-SAYF;</i> trad. English “Joseph.”
Joshua 16:2,<b>Arkites:</b> A group belonging to the tribe of Binyamin.
Joshua 16:3,<b>Yafletites:</b> An unknown group living on the border between Efrayim and Binyamin.
Joshua 16:4,<b>touches:</b> The verb is used in these texts to describe the meeting of borders; some use “impinges on.”
Joshua 17:1,"<b>a man of battle:</b> JPS: “a valiant warrior.” God is so described in the Song at the Sea, Exod. 15:3."
Joshua 17:2,"<b>our brothers:</b> Meaning “kin,” since they clearly had no brothers."
Joshua 17:3,"<b>measured-areas:</b> Boling (1982): “shares.” The Hebrew is related to the word for “rope,” hence the idea of measuring."
Joshua 17:4,"<b>to the right/the south:</b> The general orientation here is toward the east, so to face right is to face the south. <b>Yashuv:</b> Either a place name (LXX) or, following MT, <i>yoshevei</i>, “the settled-folk of.”"
Joshua 17:5,"<b>these towns … :</b> Boling (182) understands the whole phrase as a question, “Do these belong to Efrayim, amidst towns of Menashe?”"
Joshua 17:6,<b>There belonged to Menashe … :</b> The text here is in a somewhat garbled state; see the discussion in Nelson. <b>Three Heights:</b> Denoting a region.
Joshua 17:7,"<b>the forest:</b> Hinting at the extensive forestation of Canaan in biblical times. Already by the Roman period, some centuries later, the clearing of the countryside was quite advanced."
Joshua 17:8,"<b>There is not:</b> Heb. “There is not found.” <b>iron chariots:</b> The vaunted military superiority afforded by the Canaanite iron chariots is made more explicit in Judg. 4:7, 13, and 5:28. The use of iron seems to have been mainly in the chariots’ fittings (Hess)."
Joshua 17:9,"<b>the House of Yosef:</b> As Meyers (2004) notes, “the Children of Yosef” would be more common here, but the text wishes to emphasize the northern tribes."
Joshua 17:10,<b>outer-reaches:</b> Understood in this case by Boling (1982) as “approaches.”
Joshua 18:1,"<b>Shilo:</b> Pronounced <i>shee-LO</i>, this site houses the Coffer and is thus an important religious center in the traditions of Judges and Samuel. <b>Tent of Appointment:</b> Following its installation at Shilo in Yehoshua’s days, the tent shrine itself figures very little in later accounts of Israelite worship, especially contrasted to its centrality in the Torah’s account of the early wanderings."
Joshua 18:2,<b>Until when:</b> Or “how long.”
Joshua 18:3,"<b>write it up:</b> Others, “describe” (which, appropriately, is related to “inscribe” in English)."
Joshua 18:4,"<b>Judah:</b> Elsewhere I use the Hebrew form, “Yehuda,” referring to the tribe; but here it signifies the later, larger Southern Kingdom."
Joshua 18:5,<b>that is Bet-El:</b> Referring to Luz.
Joshua 18:6,<b>the Plain:</b> LXX: “to Bet-Arava.” The phrase indicates the Jordan Valley.
Joshua 18:7,"<b>Kiryat__:</b> The Hebrew form of the name is incomplete (lit. “city of …,” similar to “___ville” in English). JPS proposes “Kiryat-Ye’arim,” following the “Kiryat-’Arim” of Ezra 2:25."
Joshua 19:1,<b>Shim’on:</b> Pronounced <i>shim-OHN;</i> trad. English “Simeon.”
Joshua 19:2,<b>Be’er-Sheva:</b> Trad. English “Beersheba.”
Joshua 19:3,<b>thirteen:</b> The count is again wrong—a mistake by either a scribe or in our understanding of separate names on the list.
Joshua 19:4,<b>amid their hereditary-property:</b> Yehuda’s.
Joshua 19:5,<b>Zevulun:</b> Pronounced <i>ze-voo-LOON;</i> trad. English “Zebulun.” <b>Sarid:</b> LXX: “Sadud.”
Joshua 19:6,"<b>Gat-Heyfer … Et-Katzin:</b> So many interpreters, although MT seems to indicate four names, not two."
Joshua 19:7,"<b>Bet-Lehem:</b> Not the well-known town south of Jerusalem, but one in the north, situated east of the Carmel ridge."
Joshua 19:8,<b>Yissakhar:</b> Pronounced <i>yi-sah-KHAR;</i> trad. English “Issachar.”
Joshua 19:9,"<b>was:</b> More with the sense “included” here, since we have a list of towns."
Joshua 19:10,"<b>northward:</b> LXX here has “the border went northward.”
28–29 <b>Sidon … Tyre:</b> The inclusion of these key cities of Phoenicia (Heb. <i>Tzidon</i> and <i>Tzor</i>) betrays ideal rather than real boundaries on the part of the writer, as often happens in Joshua (Meyers 2004)."
Joshua 19:11,"<b>fortified city of Tyre:</b> The LXX reads “the spring [<i>’ayin</i>] of the fortress of Tyre,” different from <i>’ir</i>, “city.” The second “returned” in this verse may be a scribal error here, and hence unnecessary. <b>Mahalav:</b> The Hebrew is unclear; many read as here, similar to the “Ahlav” of Judg. 1:31."
Joshua 19:12,"<b>Oak:</b> Oak trees are apparently notable enough as a natural feature to be used in identifying a given locality, here and elsewhere in the Bible (see Gen. 12:6, 13:18, 35:8; Judg. 9:6, 37; I Sam. 10:3). <b>Adami-Nekev:</b> Or “Red Passage,” not to be confused with the “Red Pass” (<i>Maalei Adummim</i>) of 15:7."
Joshua 19:13,"<b>and Yehuda, [with] the Jordan:</b> Heb. unclear."
Joshua 19:14,<b>Dan:</b> Pronounced as <i>Don</i>.
Joshua 19:15,"<b>the territory of … Dan got away from them:</b> Or “went out of their (control)”; RSV: “was lost to them.” A fuller version of the Danite migration is recounted in Judg. 18. LXX also has a longer text here. <b>Leshem:</b> Modern Tel Dan, where in 1993 an inscription was found that is believed to contain the words “House of David,” the primary material witness for the historicity of the biblical king to date. Leshem is called “Layish” in Judg. 18."
Joshua 20:1,
Joshua 20:2,"<b>Towns of Asylum:</b> Others, “cities of refuge.”"
Joshua 20:3,"<b>[accidental] murderer:</b> Or “manslayer” (JPS). <b>blood redeemer:</b> A member of the family who, in ancient practice, is duty bound to avenge his relative’s slaying. The Western religious term “redeemer,” often used to characterize God as liberator, thus actually involves the restoration of a previously existing condition, such as freedom (redemption from slavery) or the ownership of land (redemption from a buyer)."
Joshua 20:4,"<b>receive:</b> Or “admit” (JPS); lit. “gather.” <b>a place:</b> Often referring to a sacred spot (e.g., Jer. 7:12)."
Joshua 20:5,<b>hand over:</b> To the avenging relative; lit. “close him up in his hand.”
Joshua 20:6,"<b>in judgment:</b> Or “on trial.” <b>death:</b> The death of the High (Heb. “Great”) Priest ends his general role in atoning for Israel’s guilt, and thus the manslayer’s need for “atonement” as well (Murray Lichtenstein, written communication)."
Joshua 20:7,"<b>hallowed:</b> Set apart, especially for some ritual or other sacral purpose."
Joshua 20:8,"<b>provided:</b> Or “designated” (Boling [192], who also understands this clause as referring to the past [“already”])."
Joshua 20:9,"<b>until his standing:</b> That is, he will be protected."
Joshua 21:1,"<b>Father’s [Houses]:</b> Capitalized in English to convey that these were social units in ancient Israel, rather like extended families."
Joshua 21:2,"<b>Kehatite:</b> Kehat, like Gershon in v.6 and Merari in v.7, was a son of Aharon. <b>Aharon:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-hah-RONE;</i> trad. English “Aaron.” <b>Binyamin:</b> Pronounced <i>bin-yah-MEEN;</i> trad. English “Benjamin.”"
Joshua 21:3,"<b>theirs was the first lot:</b> Yehuda’s and Shim’on’s. As Boling (1982) points out, the theme of “Judah first” is central to the structure of the subsequent book of Judges."
Joshua 21:4,"<b>the murderer:</b> The “accidental” murderer, who commits manslaughter, as in the previous chapter."
Joshua 21:5,"<b>Yivle’am:</b> MT has “Gat-Rimmon” here as in previous verse; it must be an error, and I follow LXX as a result."
Joshua 21:6,<b>Be’eshtera:</b> Called “Ashtarot” in I Chron. 6:56.
Joshua 21:7,<b>Kartan:</b> Called “Rakkat” in 19:35 and “Kiryatayim” in I Chron. 6:61.
Joshua 21:8,"<b>Rimmon and its pasture-lands … :</b> It appears that some material has been lost here; see LXX and I Chron. 6:63. The rest of the verse in the present text, in brackets, is based on some ancient biblical manuscripts. <b>Rimmon:</b> Following LXX: “Rimmon,” as the spelling in I Chron. 6:62. MT has “Dimna.”
40–41 <b>these towns were … :</b> LXX adds text here about Yehoshua’s territory and the flint knives used for circumcision in Chap. 5."
Joshua 21:9,<b>no man was able to stand:</b> RSV: “not one … had withstood them.”
Joshua 21:10,"<b>fail:</b> Lit., “fall.” <b>thing … things … promised:</b> Heb. <i>davar … ha-davar … dibber</i>."
Joshua 22:1,
Joshua 22:2,
Joshua 22:3,<b>kept the keeping / of the commandment:</b> Boling (1982): “scrupulously kept.”
Joshua 22:4,"<b>But now … :</b> The wording here resembles that of 1:15, thus drawing the conquest and allotment of the land to a close (Mitchell)."
Joshua 22:5,"<b>commandment:</b> Including the entire covenant (Boling 1982, quoting Aryaprateep). <b>love … walk … cleave … serve … with all your heart and with all your being:</b> The covenant vocabulary of Deuteronomy (see Chap. 6 there)."
Joshua 22:6,"<b>Bashan:</b> Pronounced <i>bah-SHAHN</i>, it was the prized fertile plateau east of the Sea of Galilee and north of Gil’ad."
Joshua 22:7,<b>large to see:</b> Boling (1982): conspicuously large.
Joshua 22:8,"<b>sent:</b> JPS includes “[first],” implied by the context. <b>Pin’has:</b> Trad. English “Phineas.”"
Joshua 22:9,"<b>one leader, one leader:</b> Biblical Hebrew expresses the idea of a leader per tribe by simply repeating the word. <b>thousands:</b> Boling (1982), again, understands Heb. <i>elef</i> as “village-unit” or “militia”; others, “contingents.”"
Joshua 22:10,<b>sacrilege:</b> The same Hebrew root (<i>m-’-l</i>) as the one used to describe Akhan’s actions in Chap. 7. See v.20 in the text.
Joshua 22:11,"<b>the iniquity of Pe’or:</b> In Num. 25, an Israelite marries a Midyanite woman, leading to idolatry."
Joshua 22:12,<b>he will be furious:</b> God.
Joshua 22:13,"<b>polluted:</b> In Leviticus, the term carries a ritual connotation; here, it has a less charged meaning, tied to what the Israelites consider improper worship."
Joshua 22:14,<b>Akhan … iniquity:</b> The strong reference to the story in Chap. 7 demonstrates how much the Israelites believe in their fellows’ guilt (Mitchell).
Joshua 22:15,"<b>God of gods is Y<small>HWH</small>!:</b> The phrase is not entirely clear; JPS renders it as “God, the <small>LORD</small> God!” <b>He knows, and Israel … will know:</b> Boling (1982) takes this as “Let him make known … let Israel learn.”"
Joshua 22:16,<b>may Y<small>HWH</small> himself examine it!:</b> Or “May the <small>LORD</small> Himself demand [a reckoning]” (JPS).
Joshua 22:17,"<b>… if it was not out of deep-concern … :</b> Namely, it <i>is</i> out of concern that we’ve done this."
Joshua 22:18,"<b>replica:</b> The Hebrew is from the key root of the chapter, <i>b-n-h</i>, “build.”"
Joshua 22:19,<b>from the hand of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> From God’s punishment.
Joshua 22:20,<b>word:</b> Or “matter.”
Joshua 22:21,"<b>called the altar [:Witness]:</b> So JPS, following ancient versions. It appears that the name given the altar has been omitted here, unlike normal Hebrew usage."
Joshua 23:1,"<b>many years after:</b> Or “a long time afterward.” <b>given … rest:</b> This Deuteronomistic phrase appears a number of times in Judges as well. <b>advanced in years:</b> Used, for instance, of Avraham and Sara in Gen. 18:11."
Joshua 23:2,"<b>dispossess … possess:</b> As elsewhere, the Hebrew uses different forms of the verb (<i>y-r-sh</i>)."
Joshua 23:3,<b>these nations that are left beside you:</b> Now Israel’s way of dealing with them will be cultural separation and no longer extermination (Hawk 2000). <b>invoke:</b> More than merely “remember.”
Joshua 23:4,"<b>cleave to:</b> Connoting “be in alliance with.” <b>come among:</b> The Hebrew is possibly a pun; “come in to,” an alternate translation here, can often mean “to have sexual intercourse with” in the Hebrew Bible."
Joshua 23:5,<b>a trapping-net and a snare:</b> These hunting devices are regularly applied to the moral/ethical sphere in such books as Proverbs. Here the connotation is the hidden but lethal danger of being seduced into acts of infidelity to God.
Joshua 23:6,"<b>going … the way of all the earth:</b> As Meyers (2004) points out, this phrase, a poetic description of death, is otherwise employed only of David (I Kings 2:2); here it reinforces the royal tone with which Joshua opened in Chap. 1."
Joshua 24:1,"<b>Shekhem:</b> Pronounced <i>sheh-KHEM;</i> trad. English “Shechem,” a city featured in a number of biblical narratives (for example, Gen. 34). It was situated near present-day Nablus, about forty miles north of Jerusalem, and was not part of the territories prominent in the conquest account in the first half of the book. <b>stationed themselves:</b> JPS: “presented themselves.” The phrase recalls another seminal moment, Israel standing at Sinai to make the covenant (Exod. 19:17)."
Joshua 24:2,"<b>Avraham:</b> The “a’s” are pronounced as “ah,” with the accent on the last syllable of the name; trad. English “Abraham.”"
Joshua 24:3,"<b>Across the River:</b> The Euphrates—either in Mesopotamia or west of the river, i.e., Harran, as would be indicated by Assyrian and Persian terminology (Nelson). Some connect “across” (Heb. <i>mei-eiver</i>) with the term “Hebrews” (Heb. <i>ivriyyim).</i>"
Joshua 24:4,"<b>Mount Se’ir:</b> Southeast of the Negev, in today’s Jordan. It was considered the home of the Edomites, Esav’s descendants, and is frequently connected to <b>Y<small>HWH</small></b> in the Bible. <b>down to Egypt:</b> LXX adds here, parallel to Deut. 26:5b, “There they became a large, numerous, and powerful nation, and the Egyptians oppressed them.”"
Joshua 24:5,<b>dealt blows:</b> Or “plagued”; the present translation is more literal. <b>with what I did:</b> The plagues.
Joshua 24:6,<b>waged battle:</b> Not reported or even suggested in Num. 22; Boling (182) thinks that this statement may be tongue in cheek. But it might also mean “set out to fight” (Nelson).
Joshua 24:7,"<b>he blessed, yes, blessed you:</b> Gray (1986): “he went on blessing you.”
11–12 <b>they waged battle … :</b> Note that here, in contrast to the famous story in Chap. 6, the residents of Jericho put up a fight. So, as often happens in the Bible, two versions or traditions about an event appear in the same book."
Joshua 24:8,<b>hornet:</b> An image already used in Exod. 23:28 and Deut. 7:20. Some understand it as a remnant of a hoary practice of letting insects loose in war by catapulting them in clay vessels. <b>two Amorite kings:</b> The aforementioned Sihon and Og. <b>not with your sword … not with your bow:</b> See Yaakov’s words in Gen. 48:22.
Joshua 24:9,"<b>a holy godhead:</b> A rare case of Heb. <i>elohim</i> accompanied by a plural adjective; the meaning seems to be “divine power.” <b>zealous:</b> Heb. <i>kanno’.</i> In the form <i>kanna’,</i> God is so described in Exod. 20:5 and 34:14, and Deut. 4:24, 5:9, and 6:15. Woudstra describes the concept as “God’s zeal for the maintenance of his honor”; it is a form of anger. It is often mistranslated as “jealous.” <b>your transgression and your sins:</b> The pronoun is in the plural."
Joshua 24:10,<b>remove the foreign gods:</b> Yaakov makes the same request in Gen. 35:2.
Joshua 24:11,<b>a law and a judgment:</b> Boling (1982): “a legal precedent.”
Joshua 24:12,"<b>the Record of God’s Instruction:</b> Not the usual “Record of the Instruction of Moshe,” but of God. <b>tamarisk:</b> Heb. <i>elon,</i> related to the “oak” (<i>ela</i>) in 19:33, above. <b>the Holy-Place:</b> The “Dwelling” (Tabernacle), but some others suggest “sacred precinct.”"
Joshua 24:13,<b>spoke with us:</b> Boling (1982): “negotiated with us.”
Joshua 24:14,"<b>servant of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Yehoshua, at death, finally merits the title of his master Moshe. <b>a hundred and ten years old:</b> The same life span as Yosef, another northern figure."
Joshua 24:15,<b><i>kesitas:</i></b> See Gen. 33:19. The term may indicate a weight or measure of some kind. Some render it as “lambs’ worth.”
