Joshua 24:4,<b>Y<small>HWH</small></b> in the Bible. ,"And I gave to Yitzhak—Yaakov and Esav,<br/>I gave to Esav Mount Se’ir for him to possess,<br/>while Yaakov and his children went down to Egypt."
Judges 2:3,<b>Josh.</b> 23:13 suggests that <i>tziddim</i> (“sides”) here may be short for “a whip in your sides” (Kimhi). ,"So I also say:<br/>I will not drive them out before you;<br/>they will be traps to you,<br/>and their gods will be a snare to you!"
Judges 7:22,<b>Bet-Shitta:</b> Location unknown; pronounced <i>bayt shee-TAH.</i> ,"The three hundred <i>shofars were</i> sounded,<br/>and Y<small>HWH</small> put each one’s sword against his fellow, that is, against the entire camp,"
Judges 7:22,"<b>border:</b> Lit. “lip,” used elsewhere for banks and shores.","The three hundred <i>shofars were</i> sounded,<br/>and Y<small>HWH</small> put each one’s sword against his fellow, that is, against the entire camp,"
Judges 12:2,"<b>Tzor’a:</b> A town fifteen miles west of Jerusalem, near Bet-Shemesh. The story opens not far from the border with Philistia. ","Yiftah said to them:<br/>I was a man in strife, I and my people and the Children of Ammon, exceedingly much;<br/>I summoned you, but you did not deliver me from their hand,"
Judges 12:2,<b>Manoah:</b> Pronounced <i>mah-NO-ah;</i> the name connotes a “secure resting place.” ,"Yiftah said to them:<br/>I was a man in strife, I and my people and the Children of Ammon, exceedingly much;<br/>I summoned you, but you did not deliver me from their hand,"
Judges 12:2,<b>barren:</b> A sure sign in the Bible that a significant figure is about to be born.,"Yiftah said to them:<br/>I was a man in strife, I and my people and the Children of Ammon, exceedingly much;<br/>I summoned you, but you did not deliver me from their hand,"
Judges 12:4,"<b><i>tamei:</i></b> Ritually polluted, and so forbidden (see, for instance, the list in Lev. 11).","And Yiftah gathered all the fighting-men of Gil’ad and did battle with Efrayim,<br/>and the men of Gil’ad struck Efrayim,<br/>for they had said:<br/>Fugitives of Efrayim are you, [men of] Gil’ad;<br/>[being] among Efrayim is [like being] among Menashe!"
Judges 12:5,"<b>One Consecrated:</b> Others, transcribing the Hebrew, render as “Nazirite.” See Commentary.","And Gil’ad took the Jordan crossings of Efrayim.<br/>Now it would be, when [one of] the fugitives of Efrayim would say:<br/>Let me cross!<br/>that the men of Gil’ad would say to him:<br/>Are you an Efratite?<br/>He would say:<br/>No."
Judges 12:7,"<b>until the day of his death:</b> The woman has changed the messenger’s words of v.5, foreshadowing the events of Chap. 16. The omission of the usual Nazirite prohibition against haircutting (also in v.14) is surprising, given Manoah’s request for detailed information. Perhaps this is another instance of the theme of secrecy in the story.","And Yiftah led Israel as judge for six years;<br/>then Yiftah the Gil’adite died<br/>and was buried in his town, [in] Gil’ad."
Judges 12:12,"<b>rule:</b> In the sense of “a set of rules,” also referring to one’s regular or customary practice.","Then Elon the Zevulonite died<br/>and was buried in Ayyalon, in the region of Zevulun."
Judges 15:19,"<b>Ha-Korei:</b> This can also mean “the partridge,” likely the original signification of the name. The whole name is pronounced <i>AYN ha-ko-RAY.</i>","So God split open the cavity that was at Lehi,<br/>and water came out of it, and he drank;<br/>his spirit returned, and he revived."
Judges 16:17,<b>all men:</b> Most translations from LXX on have “corrected” “all” to read “any” (<i>kol</i> to <i>ke-ahad</i>) as in the previous occurrences of the phrase. But the slight shift in wording here may give Delila a hint that Shimshon has cracked at last (see the double “<i>all</i> his heart” in the next verse).,"that he told her all his heart;<br/>he said to her:<br/>No razor has gone up on my head,<br/>for One Consecrated to God have I been from my mother’s womb on:<br/>if I were to be shaven,<br/>my might would leave me;"
Judges 19:27,"<b>with her hands on the threshold:</b> A powerful and pathetic image of a victim who is unable to escape her tormentors and get inside the house, with no help forthcoming. Note that the text is reticent to reveal whether the woman is dead or alive at this point.",Her lord arose at daybreak;<br/>he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way—
I Samuel 2:22,"<b>acting-as-a-workforce:</b> That is, serving at various tasks at the sanctuary. ","Now when Eli became exceedingly old,<br/>he heard about all that his sons were doing to all Israel:<br/>how they were lying with the women who were acting-as-a- workforce at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment."
I Samuel 4:3,"<b>grasp: Lit.,</b> “palm,” often used in Samuel in place of “hand.”","The people came back to the camp, and the elders of Israel said:<br/>Why has Y<small>HWH</small> defeated us today before the Philistines?<br/>Let us take ourselves, from Shilo, the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant,<br/>that he may come into our midst<br/>and deliver us from the grasp of our enemies!"
I Samuel 6:3,"<b>reparation-offering:</b> Heb. <i>asham,</i> a biblical sacrifice, explained in Lev. 5 as financial restitution for wrong-doing, including unintentional actions.","They said:<br/>If you wish to send back the Coffer of the God of Israel, do not send it back empty,<br/>rather, make restitution, yes, restitution to him with a reparation- offering;<br/>then you will be healed<br/>and it will be made known to you why his hand has not turned aside from you."
I Samuel 16:23,"<b>spirit …. respite:</b> Heb. <i>ru’ah … revah,</i> a nice punning contrast between Sha’ul’s malady and the relief that David’s playing provides.","And so it would be:<br/>whenever the spirit of God was upon Sha’ul,<br/>that David would take up the lyre and strum [it] with his hand;<br/>Sha’ul would have respite, and it would be well with him,<br/>and the evil spirit would depart from him."
I Samuel 17:7,<b>six hundred shekel-weights:</b> Maybe as much as fifteen pounds—the equivalent of having a bowling ball at the end of his spear!,"the shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam,<br/>while the flashing-point of his spear was six hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights of iron,<br/>and the shield bearer was walking before him."
I Samuel 20:25,"<b>at-the-front:</b> Following LXX (reflecting <i>vykdm</i>); MT has <i>vykm,</i> “arose.”","and the king sat in his seat as time and time [before],<br/>in the seat by the wall.<br/>Yehonatan was at-the-ffont, and Avner sat at the side of Sha’ul,<br/>while David’s place was counted-empty."
II Samuel 13:4,"<b>Tamar—the sister …:</b> McCarter (1984) notes how each word in this verse begins with the same letter (<i>alef</i>), producing “a series of gasping sighs,” and Rendsburg (1998–99) includes it as an example of (emotionally) “confused language.”","He said to him:<br/>For-what-reason are you so haggard, O son of the king, morning after morning?<br/>Won’t you tell me?<br/>Amnon said to him:<br/>Tamar—the sister—of Avshalom—my brother—I love!"
II Samuel 21:3,<b>horn of my deliverance:</b> See note to I 2:1. ,"David said to the Giv’onites:<br/>What shall I do for you?<br/>In what [way] may I effect-atonement,<br/>so that they may bless Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance?"
II Samuel 21:3,<b>place-of-retreat:</b> Following Goldman.,"David said to the Giv’onites:<br/>What shall I do for you?<br/>In what [way] may I effect-atonement,<br/>so that they may bless Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance?"

II Samuel 21:11,"<b>darted:</b> Reading, as is customary, <i>va-yid’eh</i> for <i>va-yera</i>.","And David was told what Ritzpa daughter of Aya, Sha’ul’s concubine, had done,"
II Samuel 21:13,<b>from the brightness … coals:</b> The text is quite problematic here; perhaps “coals” has dropped down from v.9.,"he brought up from there the bones of Sha’ul and the bones of Yehonatan his son,<br/>and they gathered the bones of the impaled ones."
II Samuel 21:14,"<b>his voice:</b> Often in the Bible, thunder is imagined as “Y<small>HWH</small>’s voice” (see, for a powerful example, Ps. 29).","Then they buried the bones of Sha’ul and of Yehonatan his son<br/>in the land of Binyamin, in the side-chamber of the burial-place of Kish his father.<br/>And when they had done all that the king had commanded them,<br/>God let-himself-be-entreated for the land after that."
II Samuel 21:16,"<b>your:</b> Missing here, but in Ps. 18:16.","and he was taken captive by Benov, who was of the descendants of the Shades<br/>—the weight of his lance was three hundred <i>shekel</i>-weights of bronze,<br/>while he was girded in new [armor]—<br/>he intended to strike David down,"
I Kings 8:10,"<b>the cloud … the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> had filled the House of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The language recalls Moshe, making Shelomo an idealized figure beyond his own time, the “Moses of the monarchy” (Fishbane).","And it was, at the priests’ going out from the Holy-Place,<br/>that the cloud filled the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
I Kings 9:13,<b>brother: A</b> treaty term for an equal partner.,"He said:<br/>What are these towns that you have given me, brother?<br/>So they called them the Region of Cavul/ As Nothing, until this day."
I Kings 10:1,"<b>Sheba, Shelomo … she:</b> The Hebrew is even more alliterative, with <i>u-malkat sh’va shomaat et sheima shelomo le-sheim Y<small>HWH</small>.</i> I was tempted to use “shining-reports” in the translation, for that reason. ","Now the Queen of Sheba had been hearing the reports of Shelomo, for the fame of Y<small>HWH</small>,<br/>and so she came to test him with riddles."
I Kings 11:31,<b>ten … one:</b> See the note to v.13 above. LXX and other versions read “two” for the second number.,"he said to Yorov’am:<br/>Take yourself ten torn-pieces,<br/>for thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:<br/>Here, I am about to tear away the kingdom from the hand of Shelomo<br/>and will give you the ten tribes,"
I Kings 14:30,<b>his mother’s name …</b> : This sentence is missing in LXX and Chronicles. ,And there was war between Rehav’am and Yorov’am all the days.
I Kings 14:30,"<b>Aviyyam:</b> Trad. English “Abijam.” Possibly a variation on “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Father” (the alternative explanation, that Yamm, the Canaanite god of the sea, is included here, is unlikely). ",And there was war between Rehav’am and Yorov’am all the days.
I Kings 14:30,"<b>Avishalom:</b> A variant form of the name Avshalom (Absalom). If he is identical to the celebrated son of David from II Samuel, a more appropriate rendering of <i>bat</i> (here, “daughter”) would be “granddaughter.”",And there was war between Rehav’am and Yorov’am all the days.
II Kings 6:25,<b>“pigeons’ dung”:</b> Usually understood as the name of a plant.,"And there was a great famine in Shomeron;<br/>here, they were besieging it<br/>until [the price of] a donkey’s head was eighty silver-pieces,<br/>and a quarter of a <i>kav</i> of “pigeons’ dung,” five silver-pieces."
