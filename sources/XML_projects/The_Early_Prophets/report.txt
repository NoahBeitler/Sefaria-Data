Joshua 10:28 -- footnote <b>as he had done to the king of Jericho:</b> That, however, is <i>not</i> recounted in the text. This kind of omission is often found in biblical narrative.
28–32 <b>as he had done … exactly as he had done:</b> The idea, using either one of these phrases, occurs seven times in this part of the text, stressing the campaign’s success (Meyers 2004). not found.
Joshua 13:20 -- footnote <b>Bet-Ha-Yeshimmot:</b> “The House of Wastelands,” an appropriate name for a location at the Dead Sea (Boling 1982). not found.
Joshua 13:26 -- footnote <b>Lo-Devar:</b> As per II Sam. 9:4 and 17:27; MT has “Lidvir,” “belonging to Devir.” not found.
Joshua 19:27 -- footnote <b>northward:</b> LXX here has “the border went northward.”
28–29 <b>Sidon … Tyre:</b> The inclusion of these key cities of Phoenicia (Heb. <i>Tzidon</i> and <i>Tzor</i>) betrays ideal rather than real boundaries on the part of the writer, as often happens in Joshua (Meyers 2004). not found.

Joshua 21:35 -- footnote <b>Rimmon:</b> Following LXX: “Rimmon,” as the spelling in I Chron. 6:62. MT has “Dimna.”
40–41 <b>these towns were … :</b> LXX adds text here about Yehoshua’s territory and the flint knives used for circumcision in Chap. 5. not found.
Judges 1:10 -- footnote <b>Arba:</b> Or “of the Four (Clans).”  not found.
Judges 1:11 -- footnote <b>Sefer:</b> Denoting “writing” or an “inscribed document.” not found.
Judges 3:26 -- footnote <b>Se’ira:</b> Location unknown, not to be confused with “Mount Se’ir” in other biblical texts. not found.
Judges 7:22 -- footnote <b>Bet-Shitta:</b> Location unknown; pronounced <i>bayt shee-TAH.</i>  not found.
Judges 7:22 -- footnote <b>border:</b> Lit. “lip,” used elsewhere for banks and shores. not found.
Judges 10:8 -- footnote <b>Gil’ad:</b> The large area across the Jordan to the east (north of Ammon), often occupied by the Israelites. The name appears to mean “rugged,” an apt description. not found.
Judges 15:3 -- footnote <b>evil with them:</b> In the sense of “to them.”
4–5 <b>So Shimshon went … :</b> The long string of verbs here, and in passages like 16:3, seems to reflect the hero’s precipitous action, so much a part of his character. <b>foxes:</b> It is not clear whether these or jackals are meant, as the distinction, sadly for me, is not always made in the Bible. Jackals, as social animals, would be more catchable in a naturalistic setting, whereas foxes, whose behavior is more solitary, suggest a miraculous, folktale background, perhaps more appropriate here. not found.
Judges 15:8 -- footnote <b>Etam’s Crag:</b> Identification unknown. not found.
Judges 15:19 -- footnote <b>Ha-Korei:</b> This can also mean “the partridge,” likely the original signification of the name. The whole name is pronounced <i>AYN ha-ko-RAY.</i> not found.
Judges 16:17 -- footnote <b>all men:</b> Most translations from LXX on have “corrected” “all” to read “any” (<i>kol</i> to <i>ke-ahad</i>) as in the previous occurrences of the phrase. But the slight shift in wording here may give Delila a hint that Shimshon has cracked at last (see the double “<i>all</i> his heart” in the next verse). not found.
Judges 16:23 -- footnote <b>Dagon:</b> Pronounced <i>dah-GOHN,</i> a Semitic fertility god, the worship of whom was adopted by the Philistines. See I Sam. 5 for a further story regarding the god’s statue.
23–24 <b>our:</b> Each Hebrew phrase ends with the suffix -<i>einu,</i> “our,” creating a kind of rhyme (rare in the Bible). See II Sam. 12:11 for a similar scheme, based on -<i>ekha,</i> “your.” not found.

Judges 19:27 -- footnote <b>with her hands on the threshold:</b> A powerful and pathetic image of a victim who is unable to escape her tormentors and get inside the house, with no help forthcoming. Note that the text is reticent to reveal whether the woman is dead or alive at this point. not found.

10, 12 <b>their young they shut up … lowing:</b> As Alter (1999) notes, the cows are forced to pull the Coffer against their natural inclination, which would be to suckle their young. Perhaps this detail underscores the power of the Coffer. not found.
I Samuel 7:1 -- footnote <b>Kiryat-Ye’arim … Giv’a:</b> Moving ever closer to the Jerusalem area. Trad. English for these towns is “Kiriath-Jearim” and “Gibeah.”  not found.
I Samuel 7:1 -- footnote <b>hallowed:</b> Here connoting “appointed.”
3–4 <b>Astartes:</b> The main goddesses of Canaan, often referred to in the Early Prophets as the objects of the Israelites’ religious backsliding. They may also be terms used to denote local pagan gods in general (McCarter 1980). not found.
I Samuel 7:11 -- footnote <b>Bet-Kar:</b> Presumably near Mitzpa. not found.
I Samuel 8:2 -- footnote <b>in Be’er-Sheva:</b> As if Shemuel, realizing their faults, puts considerable distance (fifty miles) between himself and them (Hamilton). Be’er-Sheva is trad. English “Beersheba.” not found.
I Samuel 20:16 -- footnote <b>“David’s enemies”:</b> As in II Sam. 12:14, later scribes have added the word “enemies” here, in order to avoid placing a verbal curse on David. not found.
I Samuel 20:25 -- footnote <b>at-the-front:</b> Following LXX (reflecting <i>vykdm</i>); MT has <i>vykm,</i> “arose.” not found.

Ii Samuel 4:5 -- footnote <b>nap:</b> Heb. <i>mishkav</i>, from the same root (<i>sh-k-b</i>), “to lie down,” that echoes in this chapter, emphasizing the heinousness of the murder.
6–7 <b>And here … :</b> The Hebrew passage is confusing; I follow B-R. not found.
Ii Samuel 9:4 -- footnote <b>Lo-Devar:</b> Northeast of Bet-She’an, on the east bank of the Jordan, and not far from Yavesh Gil’ad. not found.
Ii Samuel 12:3 -- footnote <b><i>bat:</i></b> Echoing the leading lady’s name. not found.
Ii Samuel 12:24 -- footnote <b>Peace:</b> Perhaps short for “Y<small>HWH</small>’s Peace.” Alternatively, it may signify “Replacement” (for the dead child). not found.
Ii Samuel 13:11 -- footnote <b>overpowered:</b> Or “took hold of.”
12–13 <b>such is not to be done … disgrace:</b> The same language is used in Gen. 34, the rape of Dina narrative. <b>vile thing … vile ones:</b> As in I Sam. 25; others understand as “foolishness … fools.” <b>he will not withhold me:</b> In order for her plea to have any force, such a thing must have been possible in royal society. Yet, as Sasson shows, it does not appear much outside of Egypt. He makes the intriguing conjecture that Tamar may have in fact been Avshalom’s daughter (see 14:27) and therefore Amnon’s niece, which would solve a number of the story’s problems. not found.
Ii Samuel 13:15 -- footnote <b>Get up! Go!:</b> With the force of “Get lost!” The wording is close to the horrifying “Get up! Let’s go!” that the Levite of Judg. 19:28 barks at his gang-raped and unconscious (if not dead) concubine. not found.
Ii Samuel 18:14 -- footnote <b>rods:</b> Heb. <i>shevet</i> carries two usual meanings: the rod of parental discipline and the scepter of royalty. Both have their echoes here.
14–16 <b>thrust … sounded a thrusting-blast:</b> The Hebrew verb (<i>t-k-’</i>) is the same. not found.

I Kings 2:6 -- footnote <b>Sheol:</b> The underworld, as a little-defined place of repose—a concept similar to that of the Greek Hades, and distinct from later Western notions of Heaven and Hell. not found.
I Kings 2:42 -- footnote <b>I hearken:</b> With the connotation of “I accept” (Cogan 2001). The Heb. <i>shama’ti</i> perhaps puns on the name Shim’i (Fokkelman 1981). not found.
I Kings 9:13 -- footnote <b>brother: A</b> treaty term for an equal partner. not found.
I Kings 9:17 -- footnote <b>Bet-Horon:</b> This town allows access to Jerusalem from the west; as Gray (1970) notes, it was strategically important in the later Hasmonean (second century <small>B.C.E.</small>) and Roman (first century <small>C.E.</small>) wars. not found.
I Kings 12:11 -- footnote <b>“scorpions”:</b> Perhaps more elaborate devices than the whips mentioned earlier in the verse. not found.
I Kings 12:19 -- footnote <b>until this day:</b> So this part of the text would predate the destruction of the Northern Kingdom in 722. not found.
I Kings 14:30 -- footnote <b>his mother’s name …</b> : This sentence is missing in LXX and Chronicles.  not found.
I Kings 14:30 -- footnote <b>Aviyyam:</b> Trad. English “Abijam.” Possibly a variation on “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Father” (the alternative explanation, that Yamm, the Canaanite god of the sea, is included here, is unlikely).  not found.
I Kings 14:30 -- footnote <b>Avishalom:</b> A variant form of the name Avshalom (Absalom). If he is identical to the celebrated son of David from II Samuel, a more appropriate rendering of <i>bat</i> (here, “daughter”) would be “granddaughter.” not found.
Ii Kings 5:1 -- footnote <b><i>tzaraat:</i></b> For centuries translated as “leprosy,” the dreaded Hansen’s disease, but modern scholars understand it as some sort of unsightly but not contagious or serious skin rash. The strong negativity it invokes (see Lev. 13–14) may be due to the common visual deterioration and hence the suggestion of death, which was the great ritual pollutant in the Bible. not found.
Ii Kings 14:25 -- footnote <b>Gat Ha-Heyfer:</b> A town in Lower Galilee, on the eastern border of Zevulun’s tribal territory (not far from Sepphoris). not found.
Ii Kings 15:29 -- footnote <b>Iyyon … Hatzor:</b> The five towns mentioned here appear to form a straight north-south line, just to the west of the Jordan River. not found.
Ii Kings 21:3 -- footnote <b>sacrificial-altars:</b> LXX has the singular here.
4–6 <b>he built … he had his son cross … made:</b> The form of the Hebrew verbs here points to archival style; to indicate a difference from the customary phraseology, I have omitted some “and”s before these verbs (see Gray 1970, following Montgomery). not found.
