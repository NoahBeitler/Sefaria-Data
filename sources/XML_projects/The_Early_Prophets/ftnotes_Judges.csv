Judges 1:1,"<b>Yehoshua:</b> Pronounced <i>ye-ho-SHOE-ah;</i> trad. English “Joshua.” <b>inquired:</b> Consulted God through an oracle. <b>Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> As explained above in “On Using This Book,” the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, whose pronunciation is not precisely known, is traditionally transcribed as “the Lord” and the like. Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it."
Judges 1:2,"<b>Yehuda:</b> Pronounced <i>ye-hoo-DAH.</i> The Hebrew name for the largest and politically most significant Israelite tribe, from which the favored dynasty of David sprang. Where it refers to the Southern Kingdom in Samuel and Kings, I use “Judah” to distinguish it from the single tribe."
Judges 1:3,"<b>Shim’on:</b> Pronounced <i>shim-OHN;</i> trad. English “Simeon.” <b>brother-tribe:</b> Contiguous to Yehuda, in the south, around Be’er-Sheva (Beersheba)."
Judges 1:4,"<b>the Canaanites and the Perizzites:</b> Indigenous peoples of Canaan; in lists elsewhere (see, for instance, Gen. 15:19–21), a number of other “nations” are mentioned (see also 3:5, below). <b>ten thousand:</b> Some scholars take the word for “thousand” (Heb. <i>elef</i>) as a military division, so the number would be smaller in that case."
Judges 1:5,"<b>Adoni-Vezek:</b> “Adoni” means “my lord/master,” a divine epithet often found in the ancient Near East. The “v” in “Vezek” is due to a long vowel at the end of “Adoni.” <b>Bezek:</b> Pronounced <i>BEH-zek;</i> either a site northeast of Shekhem or one between that city and Jerusalem."
Judges 1:6,<b>chopped off the thumbs:</b> Either to render him unfit to lead troops or simply to humiliate him (Burney).
Judges 1:7,"<b>Seventy:</b> Commonly signifying “many” in the Bible. <b>Jerusalem:</b> Along with the next verse, this contradicts the later account in II Sam. 6, where it is David who conquers the city from the Jebusites."
Judges 1:8,"<b>lowlands:</b> Heb. <i>shefela,</i> the low foothills that rise out of the coastal plain toward the central highlands."
Judges 1:9,"<b>Hevron:</b> Pronounced <i>hev-ROHN;</i> trad. English “Hebron.” <b>Arba:</b> Or “of the Four (Clans).” <b>Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai:</b> Descendants of Anak, and understood to have been giants. In modern Hebrew, <i>anak</i> means “gigantic.”"
Judges 1:10,<b>Devir:</b> Southwest of Hevron. <b>Sefer:</b> Denoting “writing” or an “inscribed document.”
Judges 1:11,"<b>Calev:</b> Pronounced <i>kah-LAVE;</i> trad. English “Caleb.” He seems to appear out of nowhere, but this section is apparently an established tradition (see Josh. 15:13–19). <b>Akhsa:</b> Pronounced <i>akh-SAH;</i> trad. English “Achsah.” See the version of this little story that appears in Josh. 15:16ff."
Judges 1:12,"<b>Otniel:</b> Pronounced <i>aught-nee-AYL;</i> trad. English “Othniel,” possibly meaning “God Is My Strength” or “God Is My Protection.”"
Judges 1:13,"<b>she induced him:</b> Some ancient versions, here and in Josh. 15:18, have “he induced her.”"
Judges 1:14,"<b>arid land:</b> Or “the Southland” (Heb. <i>negev</i>). JPS understands the expression as referring to Akhsa herself, namely, a woman without a dowry."
Judges 1:15,"<b>the Kenite:</b> A tribe of smiths (the literal meaning), associated with the Midyanites and inhabiting the region between southern Israel and the Sinai Peninsula. Moshe’s (Moses’s) father-in-law Yitro (Jethro) belongs to this group (see Exod. 18), and some older scholarly theories saw the origins of Mosaic religion there. <b>the Town of Date-Palms:</b> Probably not Jericho; possibly Tzo’ar (Zoar) (Soggin). <b>they went:</b> MT (the standard Hebrew text) has the singular. <b>the people:</b> It is not clear what is meant here; one LXX text reads “the Amalekites.”"
Judges 1:16,"<b>Tzefat:</b> Pronounced <i>tze-FAHT</i>. A town in the Negev region, not the later famous hill town (modern Safed) in the Galilee. <b>devoted-it-to-destruction:</b> Heb. verb <i>haram,</i> as in English “harem,” something or someone set apart. Here it reflects a war concept that the spoils belong to God, not to the conquerors."
Judges 1:17,"<b>captured:</b> But LXX reads “did not capture.” <b>Gaza</b> (Heb. ’<i>Azza</i>) … <b>Ashkelon … Ekron:</b> Three cities settled by the Philistines, invaders from the sea and subsequently Israel’s great enemy (see note to 13:1, below)."
Judges 1:18,"[<b>able</b>]<b>:</b> Missing in MT but present in some manuscripts. The restored text would then correspond to, for instance, Josh. 15:63, <i>lo’ yakhelu le-horisham.</i> <b>the valley:</b> Or “the plain.” <b>iron:</b> The period of settlement/Judges roughly marks the beginning of the Iron Age. For another textual comment on the Philistines’ possession of iron, and the Israelites’ need of it, see I Sam. 13:."
Judges 1:19,"<b>sons of Anak:</b> See note to 1:10, above."
Judges 1:20,"<b>Yevusites:</b> Trad. English “Jebusites,” the inhabitants of Yevus, the Bible’s chief name for pre-Israelite Jerusalem. They do not appear to have been there for an extended period. <b>Binyamin:</b> Pronounced <i>bin-yah-MEEN;</i> trad. English “Benjamin.”"
Judges 1:21,<b>Yosef:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-SAYF;</i> trad. English “Joseph.” <b>Bet-El:</b> Pronounced <i>bayt ayl;</i> trad. English “Beth-El.”
Judges 1:22,"<b>loyalty:</b> Others, “kindness,” but the biblical term <i>hesed</i> often denotes adherence to a treaty or agreement."
Judges 1:23,"<b>the land of the Hittites:</b> See note to Josh. 1:4. <b>this day:</b> Here, as in v.21 above, it is the narrator’s era which is being referred to, the actual date of which cannot be determined."
Judges 1:24,"<b>Bet-She’an:</b> Trad. English “Beth-Shean,” the important northern city in the Jordan Valley, not far from the Jezreel Valley. <b>daughter-towns:</b> Satellite towns. <b>Ta’nakh … Dor … Yivle’am … Megiddo:</b> The text takes us westward through the fertile Jezreel Valley; these sites were fortresses (Gray 1986)."
Judges 1:25,"<b>Gezer:</b> An important city at the junction of the northern lowlands and the Judean hills, on the southwest border of Efrayim."
Judges 1:26,<b>Zevulun:</b> Pronounced <i>zeh-voo-LOON;</i> trad. English “Zebulun.” <b>Kitron … Nahalol:</b> Identification uncertain.
Judges 1:27,"<b>Akko … Sidon:</b> On the northern seacoast; present-day Acre (in Israel) and Sidon (in Lebanon). <b>Ahlav … :</b> See Josh. 19:29, where it is “Mahalav.”"
Judges 1:28,"<b>Bet-Shemesh:</b> Not the more prominent Bet-Shemesh west of Jerusalem, but one far to the north, near the eventual territory of Dan."
Judges 1:29,<b>Amorites:</b> Often a general term for the Canaanites.
Judges 1:30,<b>Mount Heres … :</b> North of Bet-Shemesh. <b>the House of Yosef:</b> A term for the northern tribes.
Judges 1:31,"<b>Amorites:</b> LXX manuscripts read “Edomites,” which is more likely, given the geography. <b>Scorpions’ Pass:</b> A pass linking Mediterranean areas with the Jordan Valley. <b>the Crag:</b> Possibly the famous site of Petra, in today’s Jordan."
Judges 2:1,"<b>messenger:</b> This is the actual meaning of Heb. <i>mal’akh.</i> Even the traditional rendering “angel” does not necessarily imply a supernatural creature, as the English word itself reflects the Greek <i>angelos,</i> “messenger,” human or otherwise. <b>Gilgal:</b> An important political and cultic center, near Jericho. The name seems to indicate some kind of circular structure, of stones, perhaps a platform (Rainey/Notley). <b>Bokhim:</b> The name is interpreted in v.5, below. Gray (1986) raises the possibility that this refers to the “Oak of Weeping” of Gen. 35:8, which may originally reflect a Canaanite mourning or fasting ritual."
Judges 2:2,"<b>cut a covenant:</b> The expression derives from the idea of cutting up sacrificial animals, to imply that one who violates the agreement will wind up like them. See Gen. 15. <b>altars:</b> Where sacrifices were offered up. Pulling down pagan altars is an important covenant theme in Deuteronomy, and again in Kings."
Judges 2:3,"<b>traps:</b> Heb. unclear; <b>Josh.</b> 2:1 suggests that <i>tziddim</i> (“sides”) here may be short for “a whip in your sides” (Kimhi). <b>snare:</b> A trap for catching birds, and, more figuratively, foolish, wicked, or simply unwary human beings."
Judges 2:4,"<b>wept:</b> As they will do at the end of the book, in 21:2 (Boling 1975)."
Judges 2:5,"<b>prolonged years:</b> I.e., survived (Moore)."
Judges 2:6,"<b>a hundred and ten:</b> An ideal life span, as in the case of Yosef (Joseph) in Gen. 50:22."
Judges 2:7,"<b>Timnat-Heres:</b> In Josh. 1:50 and 24:30, it is spelled “Timnat-Serah.”"
Judges 2:8,"<b>the Children of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> This phrase acts as a unifying refrain in the stories about the judges, occurring seven times in Chaps. 2–3. <b>Baals:</b> The use of the plural here probably refers to the multiple forms and manifestations of the god in Canaanite worship. Baal (“master” or “lord”; pronounced <i>BAH-ahl</i>) was the powerful thunderstorm/fertility god of the area, whose mythic exploits are preserved on clay tablets from the ancient city of Ugarit on the Syrian coast, fifteenth–thirteenth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small> Judges and Samuel give evidence of the strong attraction of this Canaanite god for Israelite farmers. Some of Y<small>HWH</small>’s characteristics echo Baal’s; both, for example, are referred to in their respective literatures as “Rider on the Clouds.”"
Judges 2:9,<b>provoked:</b> Or “exasperated” (Moore).
Judges 2:10,"<b>Astartes:</b> Heb. <i>Ashtarot,</i> goddesses usually identified with well-known divine figures such as the Babylonian Ishtar. Here the plural is probably meant to include various local goddesses."
Judges 2:11,"<b>sold them:</b> A more figurative way of expressing “handed them over,” possibly also connoting finality or legitimacy associated with the concept of a sale. Conversely, physically “handing over” something can symbolically indicate the performance of an actual sale (see Ruth 4:7)."
Judges 2:12,"<b>they were exceedingly distressed:</b> Or, with LXX, “he (God) afflicted them” (Soggin)."
Judges 2:13,"<b>judge-leaders:</b> As noted in the Commentary, <i>shafat</i> often means “to lead” or “to govern”; I have sought to retain both senses, at least this first time. See the passage in 3:10, below."
Judges 2:14,<b>went whoring after:</b> A common biblical expression for idolatry. <b>thus:</b> Follow God’s commands.
Judges 2:15,<b>do ruin:</b> Or “behave badly” (Moore).
Judges 2:16,"<b>crossed:</b> As in the literal meaning of “transgressed,” that is, “trans” (cross) + “gressed” (went over), in the sense of violating laws or norms."
Judges 3:1,<b>all those:</b> The Israelites.
Judges 3:2,"<b>overlord:</b> A word used exclusively of Philistine nobles. Some relate the word (Heb. sing. <i>seren</i>) to the Greek <i>tyrannos,</i> from which English “tyrant” is derived. <b>Sidonians:</b> From the important Phoenician port city. <b>Levanon:</b> Trad. English “Lebanon.” <b>from … Baal Hermon to … Hamat:</b> Israel’s northern border."
Judges 3:3,<b>Yevusites:</b> Trad. English “Jebusites.”
Judges 3:4,"<b>took their daughters … :</b> This, in the eyes of the writers, was the cardinal sin, since it was understood as leading directly to idolatry."
Judges 3:5,
Judges 3:6,
Judges 3:7,"<b>Ashera-poles:</b> The name is pronounced <i>ah-shay-RAH.</i> The term for this goddess is often interchangeable here with a cult object. However, it is more probable that the name in this passage should be read as “Astarte,” who is more commonly paired with the Baals."
Judges 3:8,"<b>Cushan Rish’atayim/Nubian Double-Wickedness:</b> Probably a deliberate play on a more conventional name, or one with a more conventional etymology. <b>Aram of the Two Rivers:</b> Syria, with the Tigris and Euphrates mentioned. The Hebrew is pronounced <i>ah-RAHM.</i>"
Judges 3:9,<b>Otniel:</b> Already mentioned in 1:13.
Judges 3:10,"<b>came:</b> Lit. “was.” <b>the rushing-spirit:</b> God’s spirit is viewed as something almost physical; the same word also means “wind, breath.” Sometimes the infusion of the divine leads to an increase in physical strength, as with Shimshon’s, while in other cases it is connected to prophetic or artistic inspiration. <b>led … as judge:</b> Or “assumed leadership” (Rainey/Notley)."
Judges 3:11,"<b>Eglon:</b> pronounced <i>egg-LOHN.</i> <b>Moav:</b> Trad. English “Moab,” the territory on a plateau east of the southern half of the Dead Sea (in today’s Jordan). In the Bible, the Moabites are one of Israel’s traditional enemies."
Judges 3:12,"<b>Ehud:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-WHO’D</i>. <b>Gera:</b> Pronounced <i>gay-RAH</i>. <b>restricted:</b> This probably refers to their training, leading to the capability of fighting with either hand (Halpern). The Binyaminites are known in the Bible as talented warriors."
Judges 3:13,"<b>it had two mouths:</b> Two-edged. <b><i>gomed:</i></b> Pronounced <i>GO-med.</i> It measured a little over a foot long, corresponding to what the ancients called a “short sword.” <b>garb:</b> An outer garment, often part of military or priestly dress (see Lev. 6:3). Ehud is wearing his sword under his garment to avoid detection. <b>over his right thigh:</b> Presumably the king’s soldiers would not think to frisk him on the side opposite from where a sword is usually drawn (by a right-handed person)."
Judges 3:14,"<b>now Eglon was … well-nourished:</b> The word <i>bari’,</i> often understood as “fat” and hence playing up the burlesque aspects of the story, here may be meant to contrast the victorious Moabites with the oppressed Israelites. The same word was also used to describe the hale and healthy cows of the Pharaoh’s dream in Gen. 41:2,4,18, and 20."
Judges 3:15,"<b>the carved-images:</b> Apparently Ehud leaves the king’s presence with the other tribute bearers, accompanying them to the border marked by these images. Ehud then doubles back for his audience with Eglon, having made sure that his countrymen are safely across. <b>a secret message:</b> Or secret word (Heb. <i>davar</i>). <b>Hush!:</b> The command seems aimed at Ehud, so that others will not hear the “secret” message. But the courtiers vacate the room."
Judges 3:16,"<b>upper-chamber:</b> A room built on top of the house with air-admitting windows (Burney). <b>message from God:</b> Ehud’s choice of words ups the stakes and causes the king to rise from his seat. It may also be ironic, since the “message from/word of God” often predicts or precipitates a catastrophe in the Bible. <b>throne:</b> Heb. <i>kissei,</i> which in modern Hebrew means “chair,” rarely has such an everyday usage in the Bible."
Judges 3:17,<b>his belly:</b> Eglon’s.
Judges 3:18,"<b>grip:</b> And not “hilt,” as often understood (Stone). <b>feces:</b> Others understand this obscure word (Heb. <i>parshedona</i>) as “vestibule,” through which Ehud exited."
Judges 3:19,"<b>porch:</b> Heb. <i>misderona;</i> note the rhyme with the rare word in the previous verse, which gives the story a distinct tone."
Judges 3:20,<b>his servants:</b> Eglon’s. <b>bolted:</b> From the inside. “<b>covering his feet”:</b> A biblical euphemism for defecating (see I Sam. :3 for another example).
Judges 3:21,"<b>until it was shamefully-late:</b> Or “as long as shame demanded” (Gray 1986). <b>fallen … dead!:</b> Anticipating “fallen dead” in 4:22 and “fallen, ravaged” in 5:27, both of which refer to another enemy of the Israelites, Sisera."
Judges 3:22,"<b>Se’ira:</b> Location unknown, not to be confused with “Mount Se’ir” in other biblical texts."
Judges 3:23,"<b>thrusting-blast:</b> I have tried to keep the connection between this and Ehud’s action in v.21. <b><i>shofar:</i></b> The ram’s horn, usually sounded in battle."
Judges 3:24,"<b>Come down:</b> Reading <i>redu,</i> with LXX, for MT <i>ridfu,</i> “pursue.” <b>crossings:</b> Others, “fords.”"
Judges 3:25,"<b>stout:</b> Perhaps with double meaning, first, as “stalwart men,” and second, repeating the “grotesque” fat motif from earlier in the story (Amit 1999a)."
Judges 3:26,<b>humbled:</b> Or “subdued” (Moore).
Judges 3:27,"<b>ox-goad:</b> From Heb. <i>l-m-d,</i> a root that usually means “to learn” or, in another form, “to teach.” Klein understands its usage here as suggesting the thought “I’ll teach the enemy a thing or two.”"
Judges 4:1,<b>Ehud was dead:</b> Different traditions seem to be at work here; Shamgar is not mentioned as he is in 5:6.
Judges 4:2,"<b>Yavin:</b> Pronounced <i>yah-VEEN;</i> trad. English “Jabin.” <b>king of Canaan:</b> As Amit (1999a) notes, Canaan had no centralized authority; the characterization is probably meant to aggrandize the victory. <b>Hatzor:</b> pronounced <i>hah-TZOHR;</i> trad. English “Hazor,” the strategically and economically important city in the north of Israel, above the Sea of Galilee. An alternate tradition recounts the city’s destruction in Josh. 11:1–11. <b>Sisera:</b> A foreign name of uncertain origin; it may be a play on <i>saris,</i> “official” or “eunuch.” <b>Haroshet:</b> Meaning “farmland” and indicating the plain to the east of Megiddo (Rainey/Notley)."
Judges 4:3,"<b>iron:</b> See note to 1:19, above."
Judges 4:4,"<b>Devora:</b> Pronounced <i>de-vo-RAH;</i> trad. English “Deborah.” The name means “bee” but is also reminiscent of <i>davar,</i> “[divine] word”—appropriate for a prophet. See also 5:12, “speak forth [<i>dabberi</i>] a song.” <b>Lappidot:</b> Pronounced <i>lah-pee-DOHT;</i> “torches” is sometimes metaphorical for lightning flashes. The fiery connotations of this word have led some to identify him with the general Barak (“Lightning”). The phrase “wife of Lappidot” has been read by some as “a fiery woman,” but the form here generally calls for a proper name."
Judges 4:5,"<b>She was sitting [as judge]:</b> A counter to the enemy king in v.2, “who sat [enthroned].” <b>between Rama and Bet-El:</b> Later known as the area of the prophet Samuel’s activity."
Judges 4:6,"<b>Kedesh in Naftali:</b> Not to be confused with one of the other towns named Kedesh. <b>deploy:</b> The Hebrew denotes “drawing out” or “extending” a battle line. <b>Tavor:</b> Trad. English “Tabor,” a significant and imposing mountain centrally located in the Galilee near major roads. Gray (198) points out that, as a forested area, it would provide good cover for the Israelites."
Judges 4:7,"<b>Wadi Kishon:</b> Pronounced <i>kee-SHOHN,</i> an east-west brook which empties into the Mediterranean, east of today’s Haifa. In I Kings 18:40 Eliyyahu (Elijah) will slaughter the prophets of Baal there."
Judges 4:8,"<b>I will go, yes, go:</b> Others express the repetition of the verb by “I <i>will</i> go.” <b>a woman:</b> That is, a nonsoldier. See :54, below. Here, the text does not yet reveal the identity of the woman, whom one might assume to be Devora herself."
Judges 4:9,<b>behind him:</b> Lit. “in his footsteps.”
Judges 4:10,"<b>Hever the Kenite … :</b> See the notes to 1:16 on the Kenites and 3:17 on the intrusion of seemingly irrelevant information in biblical stories, above. The meaning of the name, “confederate,” is appropriate for a treaty partner. <b>Hovav:</b> An alternative name for Yitro, for reasons that are unclear (a separate tradition?). <b>Tzaananim:</b> Following the <i>Qere.</i>"
Judges 4:11,"<b>go out</b> [<b>to war</b>]: Applied to leadership, this common verb frequently has a military connotation."
Judges 4:12,"<b>panicked:</b> A standard biblical expression for God’s routing the enemy (see, for instance, Exod. 14:24)."
Judges 4:13,"<b>Ya’el:</b> Pronounced <i>yah-AYL;</i> trad. English “Jael.” Like some other biblical names, especially of women, this refers admiringly to an animal, the ibex or mountain goat."
Judges 4:14,"<b>do not be afraid:</b> Why would he have reason to be afraid of her or of her husband, with whom, as the text tells us in the previous verse, his lord has a pact of friendship? The phrase seems to be hinting at what is to come. <b>blanket:</b> Some understand this as a fly net."
Judges 4:15,"<b>Nobody:</b> Sisera has been reduced to the status of a nonperson, or shortly will be (Fokkelman 1999)."
Judges 5:1,
Judges 5:2,"<b>When war-loosened [hair] is loose:</b> Heb. Not entirely clear; others, “When leaders took the lead,” or Brettler’s attractive paraphrase, “When all hell breaks loose” (2001a)."
Judges 5:3,"<b>Se’ir … Edom:</b> The plateau territory southeast of Israel, in the southern part of today’s Jordan. Some have taken this to point to the region as a geographical source of early Israelite religion. Or does it simply suggest sunrise (see Deut. 33:2)? The name “Edom” denotes “red,” possibly mirroring the color of the sandstone mountains in the area. The Edomites and Israelites frequently fought, although a kinship is recognized in the Patriarchal stories of Genesis, where Edom is an alternative name for Esav (Esau), older brother of Yaakov (Jacob). <b>the earth quaked:</b> Although there are traditions about Baal, and equally about Y<small>HWH</small>, as a god who thunders and causes the earth to shake, the Heb. verb <i>z-l-l</i> with this meaning is attested only in Arabic; it may instead connote something closer to the watery images to follow."
Judges 5:4,<b>the One of Sinai:</b> A title for God.
Judges 5:5,<b>caravans:</b> Reading <i>orehot</i> for <i>orahot</i> (paths).
Judges 5:6,<b>He chose new gods:</b> Reflecting the deteriorating economic and political situation (Boling 1975).
Judges 5:7,<b>decree-makers:</b> Rulers.
Judges 5:8,"<b>those who ride on white she-asses, / those who sit on cloths:</b> The wealthy, as opposed to “those who go on the way.”"
Judges 5:9,"<b>trumpets … water-drawers:</b> Emending <i>mhtztzym</i> to a common root for “trumpet,” and likewise reading the other noun as coming from the verb for drawing water (<i>sh-’-b</i>), understanding it with LXX as representing the lowest rung of society."
Judges 5:10,"<b>their root in Amalek:</b> The tribe of Efrayim stays put, choosing not to participate in the battle (Boling). Amalek was viewed in the Bible as a traditional foe of Israel; the bad feelings stemmed from their behavior in attacking the Israelites at the time of the Exodus (Exod. 17:8–13; see also I Sam. 15:2). <b>Makhir:</b> A clan from the tribe of Menashe."
Judges 5:11,"<b>Yissakhar:</b> Pronounced <i>yi-sah-KHAR;</i> trad. English “Issachar.” Amit (2004) notes the likelihood that this should read “Naftali,” given the connection to Barak and other factors. <b>behind him:</b> NRSV “at his heels,” implying “at his command.” <b>soul searching:</b> In a negative sense; indecision."
Judges 5:12,<b>whistling for flocks:</b> Perhaps the traditional pipeplaying of shepherds.
Judges 5:13,"<b>risking life amid dying:</b> That is, with no regard to their own safety, as opposed to those tribes who did not volunteer (see Ehrlich)."
Judges 5:14,"<b>Ta’nakh:</b> Five miles south of Megiddo. <b>Megiddo:</b> The crucial pass which permits entry to the coastal plain. Because of its strategic importance, it was frequently the site of major battles. The English form “Armageddon,” denoting a final cataclysmic battle, derives from the Greek transcription of the name <i>Har</i> (Hill of) <i>Megiddo.</i>"
Judges 5:15,"<b>the stars waged battle:</b> In Ugaritic texts, rain originates in the stars, so the image reinforces the connection between cosmic forces and the flooding which seems to play such a large part in the Israelite victory (Gray 1986)."
Judges 5:16,"<b>bless:</b> Emending MT <i>d-r-k</i> to <i>b-r-k,</i> “bless,” more in keeping with the singer’s reflective pauses in the poem (e.g., vv.2, 9, 16)."
Judges 5:17,<b>Meroz:</b> Exact location unknown.
Judges 5:18,<b>for the valiant:</b> With the meaning of “fit for the valiant.”
Judges 5:19,"[?] <b>bent down:</b> Others “sank.” Note that Heb. <i>k-r-’</i> can also indicate worship. <b>ravaged:</b> The word is perhaps parallel to the underworld term “wasted” (in the homicidal, not the alcoholic sense). The Hebrew root (<i>sh-d-d</i>) can carry the suggestion of rape along with plunder, appropriate in the sexual role reversal of this story, hence the resemblance between “ravaged” and “ravished.”"
Judges 5:20,"<b>attendants:</b> Not lowly maidservants, but women of higher status."
Judges 5:21,"<b>lass:</b> Parallel to Moabite usage, along with a Ugaritic cognate meaning “girl.” Some read the Heb. <i>rehem</i> literally as “womb” and understand it as contemptuous of women. <b>neck … taking-as-spoils:</b> Redividing the text from <i>tzavarei shalal</i> to form <i>tzavar yishlol</i> at the end of the phrase."
Judges 6:1,"<b>Midyan:</b> Pronounced <i>mid-YAHN;</i> trad. English “Midian,” a region and a people whose primary location was the Hejaz (northwestern Arabia), but who also were found in the Sinai and the Jordan Valley."
Judges 6:2,"<b>dens:</b> The Arabic cognate is <i>minhara,</i> a place hollowed out by water (Burney)."
Judges 6:3,"<b>like locusts:</b> In the Bible’s imagery, the largest number possible (see Exod. 10:, where locusts “covered the eye of the earth”)."
Judges 6:4,<b>I myself brought you up … : </b> A typical Deuteronomistic passage of admonition (Burney brings parallels from Josh. 24:2ff. and I Sam. 12:7ff).
Judges 6:5,"<b>Ofra:</b> A location in Manasseh, where the Avi’ezrite clan lived. <b>Yoash:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Given”; trad. English “Joash.” <b>Gid’on:</b> Pronounced <i>gid-OHN;</i> trad. English “Gideon.” <b>Hewer:</b> More felicitous English would be “Hacker,” but that has very different associations in the age of technology. <b>in the winepress:</b> In a less conspicuous place than an open-air threshing floor."
Judges 6:6,<b>found:</b> Or “happened to.” <b>grasp:</b> Lit. “palm.”
Judges 6:7,"<b>O Lord:</b> Some manuscripts have “my lord,” which makes more sense given that Gid’on does not know that his visitor is divine. A parallel occurs in Chap. 13 with Shimshon’s father, Manoah. <b>family:</b> Indicating an extended family or clan."
Judges 6:8,"<b>Indeed, I will be with you:</b> Recalling God’s assurances to Moshe in Exod. 3 (Boling 1975)."
Judges 6:9,"<b>gift:</b> In other contexts, <i>minha</i> can mean a sacrifice of grain; perhaps it appears in a double sense here, given Gid’on’s unawareness of his guest’s true identity. In 3:17 it is the same term used to describe the tribute paid to Eglon, king of Moav."
Judges 6:10,"<b><i>efa:</i></b> Pronounced <i>ay-FAH,</i> it was a dry measure, equaling perhaps a bushel. <b>took them out … brought them close:</b> In both cases, “them” does not appear in the text, but biblical Hebrew often omits the object pronoun. <b>brought them close:</b> I.e., presented them (Moore). The verb (<i>k-r-b</i>) is frequently used regarding sacrifices."
Judges 6:11,"<b>crook:</b> A shepherd’s implement. The Hebrew word (<i>mish’an</i>) is used in Ps. 23:4 (in KJV, “Thy rod and Thy <i>staff</i>, they comfort me”)."
Judges 6:12,"<b>Alas … :</b> As often in the Bible (see again in Chap. 13 below), a person who “sees God” has good reason to fear for his life. Another example occurs with Yaakov in Gen. 32:31."
Judges 6:13,"<b>you will not die:</b> But typically in the Bible, the hero who comes into direct contact with God <i>does</i> survive."
Judges 6:14,<b>Peace:</b> Or “Well-being.”
Judges 6:15,"<b>Ashera-pole:</b> The name of this goddess and her cult object, representing a tree, are accentuated in this verse by the repeated occurrences of “sh” sounds in Hebrew: <i>shor</i> (ox), <i>asher</i> (that), and <i>Ashera,</i> and secondarily by <i>u-far ha-sheni sheva’ shanim</i> (“second-born bull, seven years old”)."
Judges 6:16,<b>afraid:</b> Another indication of a character weakness in Gid’on.
Judges 6:17,"<b>deliver him:</b> Others, “defend his cause.”"
Judges 6:18,"<b>Yerub-baal/Let-Baal-Strive:</b> Or “Let-Baal-Sue.” Trad. English is “Jerubbaal.” In actuality the name probably means “May Baal Plead [for Me]”; the story, however, understands it otherwise, in a classic case of folk etymology. Normally, later scribes polemically substituted <i>bosket,</i> “shame,” for the Baal part of such names (see also “Ish-Boshet” for “Ish-Baal” in II Sam. 2:8,10). Here, though, they did not, because of the centrality of the name Baal in this episode (Burney)."
Judges 6:19,"<b>Children of the East:</b> Or “easterners,” denoting other nomadic groups (Rainey/Notley) <b>Yizre’el:</b> Pronounced <i>yiz-reh-AYL;</i> trad. English “Jezreel,” the large, fertile valley in the northern part of Israel."
Judges 6:20,"<b>the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> clothed Gid’on:</b> An unusual description which demonstrates how physical the concept of “spirit” is in the Bible. Yet it is not a magical talisman to be used at will, like a helmet conferring invisibility; the text does not say “Gid’on clothed himself in it.”"
Judges 6:21,"<b>clipping:</b> Others, “fleece.”"
Judges 7:1,<b>Trembling:</b> Anticipating the people’s feelings in v.3. <b>Sage:</b> Or “oracle.”
Judges 7:2,<b>honor itself:</b> Take the credit.
Judges 7:3,"<b>Who is fearful and trembling?:</b> The concern is that the fearful soldier will demoralize his comrades; see Deut. 20:8. <b>depart:</b> Heb. <i>tz-p-r,</i> a verb with uncertain meaning. Some emend to <i>’-v-r,</i> “cross over,” among others. On the other hand, it sounds like the word for “bird/sparrow,” and so possibly suggests “fly away like a sparrow,” or even “Let him turn back twittering.” <b>Gil’ad:</b> Possibly with the connotation of “fright” (Burney traces it to Babylonian <i>gadalu,</i> “to be afraid”), given that no “Mount Gil’ad” is attested in the Bible."
Judges 7:4,"<b>refine:</b> The Heb. <i>tz-r-f</i> is a metallurgical term for “smelt, test the mettle.” It may also be a play on the <i>tz-p-r</i> of v.3, since <i>p</i> and <i>f</i> are the same root letter in Hebrew (Boling 1975)."
Judges 7:5,"<b>licks … crouches:</b> In Burney’s view, lapping the water on the stomach means that they are vulnerable to attack, and hence God is clearly the only one who can deliver them. The traditional explanation is that the alternative posture, on the knees, implies idolatry."
Judges 7:6,"<b>three hundred:</b> Mobley (2005) memorably compares this number to other celebrated small groups of fighters such as the three hundred Spartans, the Seven Samurai, and the Dirty Dozen."
Judges 7:7,<b>place:</b> Home.
Judges 7:8,<b>the camp:</b> Of the enemy.
Judges 7:9,<b>go down:</b> In force.
Judges 7:10,<b>like locusts:</b> The same image had been used in 6:5.
Judges 7:11,"<b>barley bread:</b> A symbol of the Israelite farmers, in contrast to the nomadic Midyanites (Gray 1986). The Hebrew word for “bread,” <i>lehem,</i> also recalls the verb <i>l-h-m,</i> “to fight/battle”; as Niditch (2008) notes, such word associations are characteristic of dreams. <b>turning over:</b> And over. <b>overturned it … fell:</b> Words used elsewhere in the Bible to connote destruction. <b>upward:</b> Or “upside down.” <b>and the tent fell down!:</b> Earlier in the line, after “it struck it,” MT has “it fell down,” which is omitted in LXX and appears to be superfluous."
Judges 7:12,<b>companies:</b> Lit. “heads.”
Judges 7:13,"<b>middle watch:</b> The biblical night was divided into three- to four-hour watches, so this would be around ten <small>P.M.</small> <b>just installed … the watchmen:</b> The new detail, which was thus not fully settled in yet."
Judges 7:14,"<b>they shouted:</b> Boling (1975) suggests that the verb (Heb. <i>r-w-tz</i>) can have the meaning “jump up,” hence he uses “awoke with a start.”"
Judges 7:15,"<b>against his fellow:</b> In other words, the enemy were so confused and panicked that they killed one another. <b>Bet-Shitta:</b> Location unknown; pronounced <i>bayt shee-TAH.</i> <b>border:</b> Lit. “lip,” used elsewhere for banks and shores."
Judges 7:16,<b>the water:</b> The significance of this is unclear here. <b>Bet-Bara:</b> Location unclear.
Judges 7:17,"<b>heads:</b> The Hebrew, true to its idiom, has the singular; similarly with “grasp” (from lit. “palm”) in 8:6."

Judges 9:1,"<b>Avimelekh:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-vee-MEH-lekh;</i> trad. English “Abimelech.” <b>his mother’s brothers:</b> As the son of a concubine, his legal standing would be diminished in his father’s house. <b>Father’s House:</b> A social unit in ancient Israel, much like an extended family."
Judges 9:2,"<b>landowners:</b> Heb. <i>be’alim,</i> the plural of <i>Baal,</i> but here used in its human Hebrew meaning of “master, owner.” <b>bone and … flesh:</b> Idiomatically in English, “flesh and blood.”"
Judges 9:3,"<b>on one stone:</b> In Gray’s view (1986), so portrayed to concentrate the blood, with the effect of bringing down a curse of the land on the perpetrator. Some see the act as a ritual killing. <b>Yotam:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-TAHM;</i> trad. English “Jotham.”"
Judges 9:4,"<b>Bet-Millo:</b> Pronounced <i>bayt mee-LO.</i> The name signifies “earth-fill,” possibly describing the supporting structure for a city wall. <b>of the monument:</b> Following the suggestion of LXX; MT has “propped up.” Klein notes the man-made and hence profane nature of this tree, as opposed to, for example, Deborah’s palm tree."
Judges 9:5,"<b>Mount Gerizim:</b> Pronounced <i>ge-ree-ZEEM,</i> one of the two large hills overlooking Shekhem; ironically, in Deut. 2 it is the site of the blessing of Israel."
Judges 9:6,"<b>The trees went, they went:</b> The equivalent of “Once, the trees went,” in a fairy-tale tone."
Judges 9:7,"<b>luxuriant-oil … honor:</b> Olive oil in ancient Israel was a sign of plenty and pleasure; mourners avoided its use (see Isa. 61:3). <b>through which:</b> Following LXX; MT has “with which, through me.”"
Judges 9:8,"<b>new-wine:</b> The first product of the treading of the grapes, which seems to have had intoxicating properties (Burney)."
Judges 9:9,"<b>all the trees:</b> The “all” feels like a stylistic flourish, coming as it does at the end of the sequence. <b><i>atad:</i></b> This appears to be a large, wild-looking tree (<i>Zizyphus spina-christi</i>) whose roots destroy those of other fruit trees and whose wood burns well (Hareuveni). It is thus a fine choice as a symbol of the powerful but destructive Avimelekh. Others understand it as a thorny bush such as the boxwood."
Judges 9:10,"<b>to the trees:</b> A departure from the usage “to them,” which characterized the previous three answers; this heightens the gravity of the <i>atad</i>’s answer. <b>shade:</b> Heb. <i>tzel,</i> as Gray (1986) reminds us, can also mean “protection.”"
Judges 9:11,<b>integrity:</b> Or “wholeness.” Note how Yotam adds this word to Avimelekh’s “faithfulness” in the previous verse.
Judges 9:12,"<b>threw aside:</b> I.e., risked."
Judges 9:13,"<b>Be’er:</b> Pronounced <i>beh-AYR.</i> Some suggest modern El-Bireh, south of the Sea of Galilee, but the name is a common one."
Judges 9:14,<b>evil:</b> Burney compares it to God’s hardening of Pharaoh’s heart in the Exodus narrative.
Judges 9:15,<b>come:</b> To fruition. <b>strengthened his hands:</b> Encouraged him.
Judges 9:16,<b>put [their] trust in:</b> Or “relied on.”
Judges 9:17,<b>would say:</b> The Hebrew text has “he said.”
Judges 9:18,<b>Aruma:</b> A location a few miles from Shekhem; MT: “Torma” is possibly a corruption. <b>besieging:</b> But the syntax might indicate “alienating” (Boling 1975).
Judges 9:19,<b>spread out against:</b> Gray (1986) has “deploy.” <b>finds:</b> Or “finds-possible.”
Judges 9:20,"<b>Navel of the Land:</b> A term for the Shekhem area, where north-south and east-west roads cross (Gray 1986)."
Judges 9:21,"<b>sowed it with salt:</b> Preventing future growth, hence utterly destroying the town."
Judges 9:22,"<b>Tzalmon:</b> “The shady one,” obviously well stocked with trees (see what follows in the text)."
Judges 9:23,"<b>Tevetz:</b> Trad. English “Thebez,” presumably not far from Shekhem."
Judges 9:24,"<b>riding millstone:</b> The detached round upper millstone used in grinding grain. Archaeologists have uncovered examples of these loaf-shaped stones, which sometimes weighed as much as ten pounds, making them both portable and capable of inflicting serious damage when thrown down from a height."
Judges 9:25,"<b>Draw your sword … :</b> The scene is a foreshadowing of Sha’ul’s (Saul’s) death in I Sam. 31. <b>dispatch:</b> An intensive form of Heb. <i>m-w-t,</i> “die,” meaning “deal the death blow.”"
Judges 10:1,"<b>Pua:</b> A different name (and spelling) than that of the famous midwife (Pu’a) of Exod. 1:15ff. “Tola son of Pua” means literally “Worm son of Madder” (a plant), both of which yield a reddish dye. <b>Dodo:</b> Pronounced <i>doe-DOE.</i> Meaning “uncle” or “beloved” (like the name “David”), it has an unfortunate ring in English. Hebrew, happily, places the accent on the last syllable."
Judges 10:2,<b>Ya’ir:</b> Trad. English “Jair”; “He Gives Light.”
Judges 10:3,<b>foals … towns:</b> The two words are similar in MT; ancient versions vocalize the second as <i>’irim</i> (towns) rather than <i>’ayarim</i>. JPS nicely renders them “burros … boroughs.” The listing of possessions here undoubtedly stresses wealth; not all of these leaders are simple men of the people.
Judges 10:4,<b>Sidon:</b> Standing not only for the celebrated port city (Sidon in today’s Lebanon) but also for the surrounding region.
Judges 10:5,"<b>shattered … battered:</b> Following JPS, for Heb. <i>vayir’atzu vayrotzetzu.</i> <b>Gil’ad:</b> The large area across the Jordan to the east (north of Ammon), often occupied by the Israelites. The name appears to mean “rugged,” an apt description."
Judges 10:6,"[<b>I deliver you</b>]: Implied by the somewhat corrupt Hebrew text. <b>the Children of Ammon … the Philistines:</b> The historical subjugation of these peoples lay in the future, suggesting that these lines are a later addition."
Judges 10:7,<b>Midyan:</b> MT: “Ma’on”; I follow LXX here.
Judges 10:8,<b>Mitzpa:</b> Lit. “lookout.”
Judges 10:9,<b>the commanders:</b> Usually taken as either a gloss or an indication that two traditions have been merged. <b>Who … will be first:</b> Echoing the opening of the book.
Judges 11:1,"<b>Yiftah:</b> Pronounced <i>yif-TAH;</i> trad. English “Jephthah.” Ironically for the story of a father and a daughter, with no mother mentioned, the name denotes God “opening” the womb."
Judges 11:2,"<b>different:</b> Or “another,” with the flavor, perhaps, of “another kind of.”"
Judges 11:3,"<b>Tov/Good:</b> The region northeast of Gil’ad. The “good” part may refer to the rich soil of the area. <b>empty men:</b> As with David in I Sam. 22:2, Yiftah gathers outcasts to him. Gray (1986) translates as “destitute.”"
Judges 11:4,"<b>chief:</b> Heb. <i>katzin;</i> an Arabic cognate means “one who renders judgment”—hence, parallel to “judge” (<i>shofet</i>), another leadership title."
Judges 11:5,"<b>Agreed:</b> Lit., “this being so.”"
Judges 11:6,"<b>reinstate:</b> Yiftah had been driven out and basically disinherited, given his social status; his acceptance of leadership now hinges on his restoration (Marcus 18)."
Judges 11:7,<b>hearer:</b> The concept is a legal one; God is witness to an oath.
Judges 11:8,"<b>in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Usually indicating a sacred location such as a sanctuary in the Bible. <b>Mitzpa:</b> Klein notes the ironic use here; Yiftah doesn’t “look out” very well, for either the making or carrying out of his oath."
Judges 11:9,"<b>from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok:</b> These two wadis mark the territory from the northern half of the Dead Sea well up to the mountains of Gil’ad (east of the Jordan). Yabbok, pronounced <i>yah-BOHK,</i> is trad. English “Jabbok.” <b>it:</b> Ancient versions make more sense here; MT has “them.”"
Judges 11:10,<b>when they came up … :</b> See Num. 20–21.
Judges 11:11,<b>Kemosh:</b> Trad. English “Chemosh.” This denotes the Moabite (not Ammonite!) god Kamish; the name appears on the extra-biblical Moabite Stone. <b>Kemosh … Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Reflecting the ancient concept that a god’s control is limited to his territory (Gray 1986).
Judges 11:12,<b>Balak:</b> Pronounced <i>bah-LAHK;</i> he appears more famously in the Bil’am (Balaam) story of Num. 22–24.
Judges 11:13,<b>Heshbon … Ar’or:</b> Moabite cities; versions render the second by the more familiar form of “Aro’er.”
Judges 11:14,"<b>Yiftah’s words:</b> As Mobley (2011) notes, in this chapter and the next, words have the power of life and death."
Judges 11:15,"<b>the one going out who goes out:</b> Though some domestic animals lived inside Israelite houses, Yiftah probably means a person here. <b>offered up by me:</b> Following NJPS, so as not to prejudice the gender; the Hebrew suggests “I shall offer it up.”"
Judges 11:16,<b>Avel-Keramim:</b> “Meadow of the Vineyards.”
Judges 11:17,"<b>a lone-child:</b> And so his name would die with her (Gray 1986). In actuality the name would be carried on by a son, so in this case, it would have to be her son."
Judges 11:18,"<b>cast, yes, cast me down:</b> The Hebrew words (<i>hakhre’a hikhra’tani</i>) are an anagram of <i>’okhri,</i> “my disaster,” recalling the Akhan story in Josh. 7. Consequently the LXX emends the first phrase accordingly: “You have brought disaster …” <b>opened my mouth:</b> Took an oath, made a promise."
Judges 11:19,"<b>go down:</b> or “wander free” (Burney), reading <i>ve-radti</i> for MT <i>ve-yaradti.</i> But see JPS on Isa. 15:3, where <i>y-r-d</i> and weeping occur together. <b>weep … womanhood:</b> The Hebrew is not assonant. <b>womanhood:</b> That is, marriageable state (or “nubility”), naturally congruent with virginity in that society, but not necessarily identical to it (Wenham)."
Judges 11:20,"<b>he wrought upon her:</b> Mobley (2011) notes how the fate of this young woman, even in a book filled with violence, is “literally unspeakable.”"
Judges 11:21,<b>retell:</b> Others “bewail.” But see note to 5:11. above.
Judges 12:1,"<b>mustered:</b> Lit. “cried out to,” an obvious image of being summoned for war. <b>Tzafon:</b> Perhaps near Tell Deir ‘Alla, east of the Jordan."
Judges 12:2,"<b>strife:</b> Boling (1975) makes a case for Heb. <i>riv</i> here connoting diplomacy, not warfare."
Judges 12:3,<b>Efratite:</b> Efrayimite.
Judges 12:4,"<b><i>shibbolet:</i></b> The word, Heb. <i>shee-BOH-let,</i> means either “ear of grain” or “stream,” but that is less important than the pronunciation issue. Gray (198) points to the differing Hebrew and Arabic pronunciations of one letter as a parallel (e.g., Heb. <i>shalom</i> and Arabic <i>salaam</i>). The word itself has entered English in the form “shibboleth,” meaning a password or test word. <b>understand:</b> The reading adopted by some manuscripts (<i>yavin</i>) for MT <i>yakhin</i> (“prepare”). <b>correctly:</b> Or at least according to Gil’adite pronunciation. <b>forty-two thousand:</b> The number forty-two occurs several times in the Early Prophets (e.g., the number of boys slain by bears in II Kings 2:24, and of those massacred by Yehu [Jehu] in II Kings 10:14). It is (three plus three) times seven, utilizing patterned numbers such as we find elsewhere in the Bible."
Judges 12:5,"<b>Ivtzan:</b> Meaning “Swift.” <b>Bet-Lehem:</b> Pronounced <i>bayt-LEH-hem,</i> usually denoting the familiar town (Bethlehem) just south of Jerusalem, but Boling suggests here another site far to the north, near Lebanon."
Judges 12:6,<b>from the outside:</b> Or “abroad.”
Judges 12:7,<b>Zevulonite:</b> From the tribe of Zevulun.
Judges 12:8,<b>Avdon:</b> “Servile.” <b>Pir’atonite:</b> From a town not far from Shekhem.
Judges 12:9,"<b>Tzor’a:</b> A town fifteen miles west of Jerusalem, near Bet-Shemesh. The story opens not far from the border with Philistia. <b>a Danite clan:</b> Had the body of the tribe already migrated far to the north, as in Chap. 18? <b>Manoah:</b> Pronounced <i>mah-NO-ah;</i> the name connotes a “secure resting place.” <b>barren:</b> A sure sign in the Bible that a significant figure is about to be born."
Judges 12:10,"<b><i>tamei:</i></b> Ritually polluted, and so forbidden (see, for instance, the list in Lev. 11)."
Judges 12:11,"<b>One Consecrated:</b> Others, transcribing the Hebrew, render as “Nazirite.” See Commentary."
Judges 12:12,"<b>until the day of his death:</b> The woman has changed the messenger’s words of v.5, foreshadowing the events of Chap. 16. The omission of the usual Nazirite prohibition against haircutting (also in v.14) is surprising, given Manoah’s request for detailed information. Perhaps this is another instance of the theme of secrecy in the story."
Judges 12:13,"<b>rule:</b> In the sense of “a set of rules,” also referring to one’s regular or customary practice."
Judges 12:14,<b>wondrous:</b> Or “Wondrous One.” The sense is of something removed from the ordinary and natural world.
Judges 12:15,<b>die:</b> See note on 6: above.
Judges 12:16,"<b>Shimshon:</b> pronounced <i>shim-SHOHN;</i> trad. English “Samson.” See the discussion of the name in the essay “On the Shimshon Cycle,” above."
Judges 12:17,"<b>stir him up:</b> A Hebrew homonym is related to the idea of “beating” or “throbbing.” <b>Mahaneh-Dan:</b> “The camp of Dan.” The mention of this and Tzor’a at the chapter’s end forms a framework for the chapter; similarly, the names return at the very end of the whole cycle. <b>Eshtaol:</b> Just a few miles from Tzor’a."
Judges 14:1,<b>Timna:</b> Also close to Tzor’a.
Judges 14:2,<b>take her for me:</b> As would have been the ancient custom.
Judges 14:3,"<b>brothers:</b> Kinsmen. <b>my people:</b> LXX reads “your people.” <b>Foreskinned:</b> Circumcision seems to have been widely practiced in the ancient Near East, making the Philistines noticeably different from their neighbors. <b>she is right in my eyes:</b> Others: “she pleases me.” The phrase anticipates the book’s final section (Chaps. 17–21), where in the form, “each one would do what was right in his eyes,” it is a refrain."
Judges 14:4,"<b>a pretext:</b> Creating the right conditions for an Israelite victory, so to speak. <b>at that time:</b> The text here distances itself from the era of the Judges."
Judges 14:5,<b>along with his father and his mother:</b> Yet they do not witness his great feat of strength in v.6.
Judges 14:6,"<b>without a thing in his hand:</b> Like two other ancient heroes, Herakles/Hercules fighting the Nemean lion, and the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh (Burney)."
Judges 14:7,"<b>to take her:</b> To actually marry her. <b>honey:</b> Associated with restoration of energy, as in I Sam. 14, where Yehonatan is reenergized following a fast imposed by his father, King Sha’ul. There may also be a hidden pun here; it is theorized that there was an older Hebrew word (still used in Arabic) for honey, <i>ari,</i> which in our story signifies the lion."
Judges 14:8,"<b>broke it off:</b> “It” here probably refers to a piece of honeycomb. Scraping it off, as some translations have it, would be rather a messy procedure. The use of the rare <i>r-d-h</i> here may be for the sake of punning with the theme word <i>y-r-d,</i> “go down” (Boling)."
Judges 14:9,"<b>His father went down:</b> Shimshon appears to have taken the woman as a wife in the meantime; the events are hazy here. <b>drinkfest:</b> By participating, Shimshon would be breaking another one of the Nazirite vows."
Judges 14:10,<b>when they saw:</b> Some ancient versions have “because they feared” (the Hebrew spelling is quite close).
Judges 14:11,<b>clothes:</b> Most likely festival garments.
Judges 14:12,"<b>fourth:</b> So LXX; MT has “seventh.” <b>Seduce:</b> The verb, <i>p-t-h,</i> may also connote “deceive,” taking advantage of his gullible nature. This will happen with another woman in 16:5. <b>dispossess:</b> Or “impoverish.” <b>here:</b> Heb. corrupt; I follow ancient manuscripts."
Judges 14:13,"<b>before the daystar set:</b> That is, just before the sun came in, an element common to folktales. Some emend the rare Hebrew word for “sun” here, <i>heres,</i> to <i>heder,</i> “inner-room,” suggesting that the marriage is about to be consummated. <b>If you hadn’t plowed … :</b> The image of plowing had sexual connotations throughout the ancient world. <b>heifer … riddle:</b> Heb. <i>’eglati … hidati</i>."
Judges 14:14,"<b>Ashkelon:</b> One of the five major Philistine cities, situated on the Mediterranean coast. <b>sashes … changes:</b> Heb. <i>halitzot … halifot</i>."
Judges 15:1,"<b>the days of the wheat cutting:</b> Late spring. <b>come in to:</b> The verb often refers to sex in the Bible, and probably does here as well."
Judges 15:2,"<b>evil with them:</b> In the sense of “to them.”
4–5 <b>So Shimshon went … :</b> The long string of verbs here, and in passages like 16:3, seems to reflect the hero’s precipitous action, so much a part of his character. <b>foxes:</b> It is not clear whether these or jackals are meant, as the distinction, sadly for me, is not always made in the Bible. Jackals, as social animals, would be more catchable in a naturalistic setting, whereas foxes, whose behavior is more solitary, suggest a miraculous, folktale background, perhaps more appropriate here."
Judges 15:3,"<b>her father:</b> Many manuscripts read “her Father’s House,” thus including more people. “Household” is the same word in Hebrew; see the Philistines’ threat in 14:15 (Gray 198)."
Judges 15:4,<b>avenged:</b> Usually the prerogative of God in the Bible (Boling 195). It is also used to describe Shimshon’s final emotion and act in 16:28.
Judges 15:5,"<b>hip over thigh:</b> Burney likens the phrase to a wrestler’s term. It may also be a realistic description of the scene, with numerous body parts tangled up. <b>Etam’s Crag:</b> Identification unknown."
Judges 15:6,<b>Lehi:</b> Pronounced <i>LEH-hee;</i> somewhere in the Judean lowlands.
Judges 15:7,"<b>fresh:</b> Lit. “moist.” If it had been dry, it would have been brittle and thus might well have cracked (Gray 1986). Shimshon’s touching the remains of an ass here is another example of his violation of Nazirite rules."
Judges 15:8,"<b>With the jawbone of a donkey … :</b> Heb. difficult; some have understood <i>h-m-r</i> to mean “heap,” thus: “With the jawbone of an ass, / heaping mass upon mass …” Boling (1975) likens the phrase <i>hamor hamortayim</i> to <i>raham rahamatayim</i> (“a lass, two lasses”) and <i>rikma … rikmatayim</i> (“embroidered cloth … embroidered”) in 5:30."
Judges 15:9,"<b>Ramat … Height:</b> Heb. <i>r-m-h</i> may also denote “toss away,” fitting the action in the previous verse."
Judges 15:10,"<b>spirit:</b> Or “life-breath,” although “spirit” has been a force earlier in the story. <b>Ha-Korei:</b> This can also mean “the partridge,” likely the original signification of the name. The whole name is pronounced <i>AYN ha-ko-RAY.</i>"
Judges 15:11,<b>He led Israel as judge:</b> See Commentary.
Judges 16:1,"<b>Gaza:</b> Heb. <i>’Azza,</i> another major Philistine city along the coast."
Judges 16:2,"<b>plotted:</b> Often read as “kept silent,” but the verb may be a homonym which is used several times in Proverbs."
Judges 16:3,"<b>lay … arose … :</b> Once again, the rush of verbs seems to indicate swift, almost breathless, action. <b>doors:</b> From archaeological indications of Iron Age gates, these must have been quite large. <b>brought them up … Hevron:</b> A distance of some forty miles, with a rise of close to three thousand feet!"
Judges 16:4,"<b>Sorek:</b> A few miles south of Tzor’a. <b>Delila:</b> Pronounced <i>de-lee-LAH;</i> trad. English “Delilah.” Many meanings have been theorized for the name, including “vine” (alluding to Shimshon’s violation of his vows), “flirt” (Arabic), and “dangling curls” (Niditch 2008; the hair motif again). Most significant, in my view, is the name’s resemblance to Heb. <i>layla,</i> “night,” evocative of seduction and a fitting contrast to Shimshon’s name’s connection to “sun.”"
Judges 16:5,<b>overlords:</b> See note to 3:3 above.
Judges 16:6,<b>whereby:</b> What’s the cause (of your strength)?
Judges 16:7,"<b>gut-strings:</b> Bowstrings, which would be well-nigh impossible to break with bare hands. <b>I’d become weak, I’d become like:</b> Heb. <i>ve-haliti ve-hayyiti</i>, which feels like a deliberate rhyme. It recurs twice here, and suggests the rhythm of a folktale. The usual translation is “I will become as weak as any other man,” but that misses the style."
Judges 16:8,"<b>inner-room:</b> A place of concealment or intimacy, often descriptive of a bedroom."
Judges 16:9,"<b>new ropes:</b> In folklore, unused objects often have pristine, magical powers. Thus, animals described as “having not yet yielded to a yoke” are sometimes used in special rituals (Num. 19:2, I Sam. 6:7)."
Judges 16:10,"<b>tell me:</b> Some manuscripts add the “pray” of vv.6 and 10. <b>head:</b> The allusion to Shimshon’s hair is a fine narrative strategy for getting us closer to the truth; Shimshon is clearly growing tired of this game and is ready to reveal all. <b>warp … :</b> Of a loom. The text appears to be defective, and is appropriately filled in by LXX, along the pattern of the previous trials. I have left it here as it appears in MT."
Judges 16:11,"<b>pulled out the pin … :</b> The same verb (<i>n-s-’</i>) was used to describe Shimshon’s “pulling up” the gates of Gaza in v.3, above."
Judges 16:12,<b>short-tempered to [the point of] death:</b> Again foreshadowing the end. The idiom seems to indicate literal shortness of breath as an indicator of impatience.
Judges 16:13,<b>all men:</b> Most translations from LXX on have “corrected” “all” to read “any” (<i>kol</i> to <i>ke-ahad</i>) as in the previous occurrences of the phrase. But the slight shift in wording here may give Delila a hint that Shimshon has cracked at last (see the double “<i>all</i> his heart” in the next verse).
Judges 16:14,<b>Gaza:</b> The very site of his great triumph earlier in the chapter. <b>double-bronze:</b> Chains.
Judges 16:15,"<b>Dagon:</b> Pronounced <i>dah-GOHN,</i> a Semitic fertility god, the worship of whom was adopted by the Philistines. See I Sam. 5 for a further story regarding the god’s statue.
23–24 <b>our:</b> Each Hebrew phrase ends with the suffix -<i>einu,</i> “our,” creating a kind of rhyme (rare in the Bible). See II Sam. 12:11 for a similar scheme, based on -<i>ekha,</i> “your.”"
Judges 16:16,<b>saw him:</b> JPS posits that this fits better after v.25.
Judges 16:17,"<b>the house:</b> Presumably Dagon’s temple; the Bible uses “house” (<i>bayit</i>) for such diverse meanings as “home,” “palace,” “temple,” and “dynasty.”"
Judges 16:18,<b>a single revenge … :</b> MT has “revenge for one of my two eyes”; I follow LXX here as being more intelligible.
Judges 16:19,<b>put-his-weight on:</b> Boling (1975) understands this as “reached around.”
Judges 16:20,"<b>me:</b> Lit. “my (very) being.” Others, “soul.” In biblical Hebrew, <i>nefesh</i> almost always means “life” or “life force,” or “breathing/swallowing organs,” and not “soul” in the later sense of an entity distinct from the body. <b>with might:</b> Mentioned so often earlier in the chapter, Shimshon’s strength now returns full bore. <b>Now the dead … :</b> The multiple repetition of the root <i>m-w-t</i> (“dead, death”) highlights the importance of this statement, summarizing Shimshon’s militarily effective career."
Judges 16:21,<b>between Tzor’a and Eshtaol:</b> The mention of the place names with which the story began provides a classic aural signal that the story has come to an end.
Judges 17:1,<b>Mikhayehu:</b> Pronounced <i>mee-KHA-y’hu;</i> trad. English “Micaiah.” It means “Who Is Like Y<small>HWH</small>?” (ironic in a story about idolatry) and is sometimes shortened to “Mikha” in the narrative that follows. A more familiar variation of the name is “Mikhael” (Michael).
Judges 17:2,"<b>thousand and a hundred:</b> A sum identical to the reward promised to Delila in the previous chapter, leading some commentators to identify the mother here with that more famous lady. Or it may simply have a connecting function, enabling the editor(s) to juxtapose the two stories (and note too the reappearance in vv.8 and 11 of the place-names cited previously in 13:5 and 16:31). <b>oath-curse:</b> Invoked when human punishment cannot be brought to bear (Gray 1986). In this story it makes Mikhayehu’s nonpayment to his mother an occasion for divine punishment. <b>Blessed is my son:</b> She effectively removes the curse (JPS note)."
Judges 17:3,<b>for my son:</b> Heb. <i>li-vni;</i> LXX reads “alone” (<i>levaddi</i>). <b>a carved and molten</b> [<b>idol</b>]: The figure would be made from molten metal poured into a mold carved in the desired shape. This emphatically violates the Israelites’ covenant with Y<small>HWH</small> (see Exod. 20:2). <b>to you:</b> To God.
Judges 17:4,<b>two hundred pieces:</b> What did she do with the other nine hundred? Is this a hint of misappropriation or of stinginess?
Judges 17:5,"<b>house of God:</b> Some read as “house of gods,” which the Hebrew allows; most translations simply use “shrine.” <b><i>efod:</i></b> See note to 8:27 above. <i>terafim:</i> usually understood as household idols or figurines; see Gen. 31:19ff. <b>given-mandate:</b> Lit. “filled the hand,” installing him as a priest. <b>one of his sons:</b> Since he was not a Levite, this is quite illegal (Amit 2004)."
Judges 17:6,<b>lad:</b> Or “young man.” <b>sojourning:</b> Living there temporarily.
Judges 17:7,"<b>to make his way:</b> Or, parallel to Akkadian usage, “to pursue his endeavors.”"
Judges 17:8,"<b>“father”:</b> Although the Levite is still a “lad” and thus probably under twenty, the term “father” here can connote “technical adviser,” in the same spirit as Yosef in Gen. 45:8 is called a “Father to Pharaoh.” <b>ten pieces of silver:</b> This yearly salary makes clear how enormous a sum the original amount was.
10–11 <b>So the Levite … the Levite:</b> The Hebrew text seems corrupt here, if only because of the awkward repetition of the subject."
Judges 17:9,<b>that Y<small>HWH</small> will do good for me:</b> Mikhayehu seems to feel that his new idol and shrine will be accepted and even favored by God.
Judges 18:1,"<b>there had not fallen [any land] to it … hereditary-property:</b> That is, they had not gained a solid foothold in the area between Israelite and Philistine territory."
Judges 18:2,"<b>voice:</b> Or “accent, dialect.” <b>turned aside:</b> A verb that often indicates moral failing (“turning aside from the way”) in the Bible (Klein)."
Judges 18:3,<b>straight before:</b> Lit. “in front of”; it connotes “acceptable.”
Judges 18:4,"<b>Layish:</b> Meaning “lion.” The town was located at the northern border of ancient Israel (today’s Tel Dan). <b>in security:</b> Or “unafraid,” as in Ps. 8:53, Prov. 3:23–26, and Job 11:18–19. <b>the Sidonians:</b> The inhabitants of Tyre on the Mediterranean coast. <b>no one humiliating anyone … [or] barring an heir:</b> Heb. unclear. “Barring an heir,” if correct, would denote preventing a person from receiving his rightful inheritance. <b>dealings:</b> Or “communication” (Rainey/Notley). <b>anyone:</b> Heb. <i>adam,</i> for which versions read, perhaps with better sense, <i>Aram</i> (Syria)."
Judges 18:5,"<b>good:</b> Fertile, prosperous."
Judges 18:6,"<b>Kiryat-Ye’arim:</b> With the meaning of “wooded town,” west of Jerusalem. It lay on the Judah/Binyamin border. <b>behind:</b> West of."
Judges 18:7,<b>six hundred:</b> LXX adds the definite article to “men.”
Judges 18:8,<b>heart:</b> Frequently with the connotation of “mind” in biblical texts.
Judges 18:9,<b>gods that I made:</b> Emphasizing the pagan nature of the situation (Amit 1999a).
Judges 18:10,<b>feelings:</b> Or “temperament.”
Judges 18:11,"<b>anyone:</b> Or, as suggested for v.7, “Aram.”"
Judges 18:12,"<b>Yisrael:</b> Israel, the patriarch Yaakov (Jacob)."
Judges 18:13,"<b>Yehonatan:</b> Pronounced <i>ye-ho-nah-TAHN;</i> trad. English “Jonathan.” <b>Moshe:</b> MT has inserted a small <i>n</i>-letter in the middle of the name, turning it into “Menashe” (Manasseh). A scribe, unable at this point to erase the name and substitute another, clearly sought to remove any reference to Moshe as the ancestor of idolatrous priests, and came up with this “solution.” <b>exile of the land:</b> Kimhi reads <i>ha-aretz,</i> “land,” as <i>ha-aron,</i> “the Coffer,” referring to the capture of the Ark of the Covenant by the Philistines in I Sam. 4. But the phrase probably indicates the destruction of the Northern Kingdom, Israel, in 722 <small>B.C.E.</small>, and thus is yet another condemnation of the north in these texts."
Judges 18:14,"<b>all the days … at Shilo:</b> The Danite shrine, as rival to the (“legitimate”) sanctuary at Shilo, parallels the idolatrous one just mentioned, which was set up in opposition to the Jerusalem Temple."
Judges 19:1,"<b>Now it was in those days … :</b> Here the refrain, which occurred already in 17:6 and 18:1, introduces the consequences of political anarchy on moral behavior, not in social or cultic matters as before. <b>flanks:</b> The remote parts. <b>Efrayim:</b> The name connotes fertility, but there will be none in this story (Klein). <b>concubine woman:</b> Not quite the status of a wife; see similarly II Sam. 5:13, 19:6, and II Chron. 11:21."
Judges 19:2,"<b>whored:</b> Some read as a homonym of <i>z-n-h,</i> based on LXX, meaning “felt repugnance against” or “became angry with.”"
Judges 19:3,<b>She brought him:</b> MT; LXX has “he came.”
Judges 19:4,<b>pressed him:</b> The same verb is used in the companion story in Gen. 19 (vv.3 and 9).
Judges 19:5,<b>the lengthening of the day:</b> Later in the day.
Judges 19:6,<b>Yevus:</b> Pronounced <i>yeh-VOOS.</i> This was the earlier name for Jerusalem; see 1:21 above. <b>was with him:</b> Versions read “and his serving-lad” (<i>ve-naaro</i>) instead of the MT’s <i>ve-’immo.</i>
Judges 19:7,<b>was exceedingly low:</b> Or lit. “had gone down exceedingly.”
Judges 19:8,"<b>Giv’a:</b> Pronounced <i>giv-AH;</i> trad. English “Gibeah,” a town located a few miles north of Jerusalem, on the way to Shekhem."
Judges 19:9,<b>Rama:</b> Just north of Giv’a.
Judges 19:10,"<b>square:</b> Or more literally, “broad place, market-place.” <b>no one was gathering them … :</b> There was no hospitality for these travelers."
Judges 19:11,"<b>work … fields:</b> JPS renders as “property outside the town.” <b>he was sojourning:</b> So it takes another stranger, not a native, to aid the travelers. And he is, not accidentally, one of their fellow Efrayimites."
Judges 19:12,"<b>my house:</b> MT has “the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,” probably a mistake. The possessive Hebrew letter <i>yod,</i> added to <i>bayit,</i> “house,” may simply have been misunderstood, since <i>yod</i> could also serve as an abbreviation for Y<small>HWH</small>."
Judges 19:13,"<b>Yes, there is straw … :</b> The guest modestly requests only shelter here, not food for himself or for his animals. See similarly Num. 20:17, , and 21:22."
Judges 19:14,<b>for sure do not spend the night in the square!:</b> The old man evidently knows a thing or two about the locals.
Judges 19:15,"<b>putting their hearts in good-humor:</b> NRSV “enjoying themselves.” The protagonist has yet another drinkfest! <b>to know him:</b> Their request, and their action in v.25, has a sexual tone (as in the “biblical sense” of “know”)."
Judges 19:16,"<b>Since this man came into my house:</b> Emphasizing the host’s solemn responsibility for the safety of his guest. <b>this vile thing:</b> Another sexual crime, the rape of Dina, is similarly described in Gen. 34:7, as well as the rape of Tamar in II Sam. 13:12."
Judges 19:17,"<b>nubile daughter:</b> As elsewhere in the Bible, Heb. <i>betula</i> means a girl of marriageable age, not necessarily a virgin."
Judges 19:18,"<b>with her hands on the threshold:</b> A powerful and pathetic image of a victim who is unable to escape her tormentors and get inside the house, with no help forthcoming. Note that the text is reticent to reveal whether the woman is dead or alive at this point."
Judges 19:19,"<b>Get up:</b> Elsewhere, I use “arise” for this verb, but that feels too formal here. This is the most repulsive line in the whole story; can he think of nothing else to say after she has been raped and abused all night?"
Judges 19:20,"<b>knife:</b> Specifically, a large knife or a cleaver. It derives from the verb “to eat/devour,” which is also found in the common biblical idiom for destruction by the sword (and which uses “mouth” for “edge”). The same word describes Avraham’s knife, intended for his son’s throat in Gen. 22:6, 10. <b>chopped her up … sent her off:</b> Sha’ul does the same thing with an ox (I Sam. 11:7) in order to rally the Israelites to battle. The narrator here, unlike the husband, chooses to retain the last shred of the woman’s dignity by referring to the cut-up pieces as “her.” Or it may be bitterly ironic—what of “her” is left?"
Judges 19:21,"<b>Never has there been, never has been seen:</b> Heb. <i>lo nihyeta ve-lo nir’ata.</i>"
Judges 20:1,"<b>from Dan to Be’er-Sheva:</b> The classic expression of Israel’s ideal boundaries (see I Kings 5:5), it is the moral equivalent of America’s “from sea to shining sea.” <b>Mitzpa:</b> Trad. English “Mizpah,” the site of a centralized shrine to Y<small>HWH</small> a few miles from Giv’a. It became important mainly after the Babylonian Exile in the sixth century."
Judges 20:2,"<b>“cornerstones”:</b> A metaphorical term for “chieftains.” <b>four hundred thousand:</b> Clearly an exaggeration, as often in biblical and other ancient texts."
Judges 20:3,<b>intended:</b> The Hebrew denotes “conceiving an image” (Gray 1986). <b>my concubine they forced:</b> He conveniently leaves out his act of pushing her out to them (Klein).
Judges 20:4,<b>lewd … [thing]:</b> The Hebrew word (<i>zimma</i>) is used in reference to incest and other sexual crimes in Lev. 18–20.
Judges 20:5,"<b>give yourselves word and advice:</b> JPS: “produce a plan of action.” See also 19:30, above: “get advice.”"
Judges 20:6,<b>myriad:</b> Ten thousand. <b>Giv’a:</b> MT reads “Geva.”
Judges 20:7,<b>chosen:</b> Or “choice.”
Judges 20:8,"<b>restricted in their right hand:</b> See note to 3:15 above. <b>not miss:</b> This verb, Heb. <i>h-t-’,</i> most frequently appears in the biblical vocabulary as the common term for “to sin,” namely, “to (morally) miss the mark/target.” It can also mean “to give offense” when used in an inter-human context."
Judges 20:9,"<b>Who will go up for us first … Yehuda:</b> Echoing the opening of the book. Ironically and ominously, what began there as a battle for survival ends here in a civil war."
Judges 20:10,"<b>brought to ruin:</b> Burney understands Heb. <i>sh-h-t</i> by means of Akkadian <i>shahatu,</i> “felled.”"
Judges 20:11,<b>strengthened themselves:</b> Or “took courage.”
Judges 20:12,"<b>offerings-up:</b> Others, “burnt offerings,” the most common type of biblical sacrifices. <b><i>shalom</i>-offerings:</b> The idea seems to be of a sacrifice that creates reconciliation and solidarity within the community. JPS has “offerings of well-being.”"
Judges 20:13,"<b>Pin’has:</b> Pronounced <i>pin-HASS,</i> and meaning “dark-skinned” in Egyptian. Trad. English “Phineas.”"
Judges 20:14,<b>torn away:</b> Others: “lured away.”
Judges 20:15,"<b>Cave:</b> LXX reads <i>mi-maarav le</i>-, “to the west of,” for MT <i>mi-maarei.</i>"
Judges 20:16,<b>opposite:</b> Manuscripts read “south of.”
Judges 20:17,<b>drew out:</b> Deployed (Burney).
Judges 20:18,<b>arrangement:</b> According to prearranged plan. <b>a rising-mass of smoke:</b> As a signal (see Jer. 6:1).
Judges 20:19,<b>faced about:</b> In retreat.
Judges 20:20,"<b>encircled:</b> Some suggest emending <i>kitteru</i> to <i>kittetu</i> (“crushed to pieces”). <b>and they pursued him:</b> MT has, probably erroneously, “they had them pursued.” <b>Menuha:</b> Location unknown; Boling suggests Noha. <b>Giv’a:</b> Usually emended to “Geva,” as in Boling."
Judges 20:21,"<b>picked them off:</b> Following JPS’s ingenious reflection of Heb. <i>’-l-l</i>, “glean.” Another colloquial possibility would be “cleaned them up.” <b>Gid’om:</b> The name is otherwise unattested; many suggest emending to “Geva.”"
Judges 20:22,<b>Children of Binyamin:</b> Nonmilitary personnel (Burney).
Judges 21:1,
Judges 21:2,
Judges 21:3,
Judges 21:4,
Judges 21:5,<b>the great sworn-oath:</b> See the beginning of Chap. 20.
Judges 21:6,"<b>Hewn off:</b> Some manuscripts read “subtracted, missing” (<i>nigra</i>’ for <i>nigda</i>’)."
Judges 21:7,"<b>Yavesh-Gil’ad:</b> Trad. English “Jabesh Gilead,” a town across the Jordan in northwest Gil’ad. It too is bound up with the life and reign of Sha’ul in the next book."
Judges 21:8,"<b>devote-to-destruction:</b> See note to 1:17, above."
Judges 21:9,"<b>nubile girls:</b> See note to 19:24, above. <b>which is in the land of Canaan:</b> This designation does not say much for all the conquests enumerated in Joshua and Judges; instability still reigns (Boling 1975)."
Judges 21:10,<b>a surviving possession:</b> Heb. unclear.
Judges 21:11,"<b>north:</b> Lit. “toward Tzafon,” an impressive mountain (today called Jebel Aqra’) near the Mediterranean coast in Syria. <b>toward the rising of the sun:</b> In contrast to the previous example, I have stayed with Hebrew usage here as more immediately understandable, meaning “east.” <b>Levona:</b> A few miles from Shilo."
Judges 21:12,<b>took up:</b> Boling renders “took enough.”
Judges 21:13,"<b>went off:</b> More idiomatically, as in JPS, “dispersed.”"
