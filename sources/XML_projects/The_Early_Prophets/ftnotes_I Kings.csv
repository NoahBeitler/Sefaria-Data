I Kings 1:1,<b>David:</b> Pronounced <i>dah-VEED.</i> 
I Kings 1:2,<b>advanced in days:</b> A usual biblical expression for old age. Heb. <i>yamim</i> can sometimes mean “years.”
I Kings 1:3,"<b>nubile:</b> Heb. <i>betula</i>, usually translated “virgin,” means mainly one who has passed puberty, a marriageable young woman. "
I Kings 1:4,"<b>caregiver:</b> Heb. <i>sokhenet;</i> the masculine version appears in Isa. :15, as an old term for “steward of the household.”"

I Kings 1:6,"<b>Shunammite:</b> From the town of Shunem, near the Jezreel Valley in the north. It resonates with the beginning of David’s rule, since the Philistines pitched camp there before the battle of Mount Gilboa, where Sha’ul was killed."
I Kings 1:7,"<b>know her:</b> The Hebrew verb <i>y-d-’</i> most often indicates awareness or knowledge, but can also, as here, be extended to include intimate, “biblical” knowledge: sexual relations."
I Kings 1:8,"<b>Adoniyya:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-do-nee-YAH;</i> trad. English ‘Adonijah.” “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Lord” is an ironically pious name for David’s son who will not get to rule. The name sometimes appears in fuller form, “Adoniyyahu.”"
I Kings 1:9,<b>And he was also:</b> He is spoiled and handsome like Avshalom (Absalom) his older brother.

I Kings 1:23,"<b>Serpent Stone:</b> Others, “the stone of Zoheleth,” “the sliding stone.” "
I Kings 1:24,"<b>En-Rogel:</b> Pronounced <i>ayn ro-GAYL.</i> The “Washer’s [or Fuller’s] Spring” in the Kidron Valley near Jerusalem, marking the boundary line between the territories of Benjamin and Judah. It figured previously in the spy story of II Sam. 17. "
I Kings 1:25,"<b>invited:</b> Literally, “called.”"
I Kings 1:26,<b>Shelomo:</b> Trad. English “Solomon.” The accent is on the last syllable.
I Kings 1:27,"<b>Bat-Sheva:</b> Pronounced <i>baht-SHEH-vah;</i> trad. English “Bathsheba.” David’s beloved wife. The <i>Sheva</i> part of her name puns with the Hebrew word for “swear [an oath],” a theme in this chapter (Walsh)."
I Kings 1:28,"<b>my lord king … Adoniyyahu become king:</b> Heb. <i>adoni ha-melekh … malakh adoniyyahu</i>, a wordplay that is another indication of the narrator’s “mastery of intonation” (Fishbane). "
I Kings 1:29,<b>your handmaid:</b> An appropriate way for Bat-Sheva to refer to herself in court etiquette.
I Kings 1:30,<b>confirm:</b> Or literally “fill in” (Alter 1999).
I Kings 1:31,"<b>What is your [business]?:</b> The Heb. <i>ma-lakh</i> may be a pun on <i>malokh</i>, “reign as king” (Walsh)."
I Kings 1:32,<b>lies beside his fathers:</b> Indicating a peaceful death. 
I Kings 1:33,"<b>guilty ones:</b> Others, “offenders,” “criminals.”"
I Kings 1:34,"<b>after me … in my place:</b> Heb. <i>aharai … tahtai.</i> The two parallel words provide a poetic rhythm, hinting at the importance of the thought (Walsh)."
I Kings 1:35,<b>mule:</b> The animal of choice for royal riders. 
I Kings 1:36,"<b>the Gihon:</b> Pronounced <i>gee-HOHN</i>, “The Gusher,” the important spring just outside of Jerusalem, not far from En-Rogel. Friedman (1999) notes that a similarly named river is found in the Garden of Eden story (Gen. 2:13), and thus posits that an “original core” of the first half of the Bible was bracketed by occurrences of this name."
I Kings 1:37,"<b><i>shofar:</i></b> The ram’s horn, sounded to summon people for military, official, or religious occasions. May "
I Kings 1:38,<b>King Shelomo live!:</b> The Hebrew idiom for “Long live King Shelomo!”
I Kings 1:39,"<b><i>Nagid:</i></b> Pronounced <i>nah-GEED</i>, this is a term possibly indicating dynastic choice, but not identical with “king.” Others, “prince, designate.”"
I Kings 1:40,"<b>Amen!:</b> From a verb meaning “to trust, to be certain,” it is pronounced <i>ah-MAYN</i> in Hebrew. Later, of course, it enters prayer texts, even in English. "
I Kings 1:41,<b>declare:</b> Or “say.” Some ancient manuscripts have “do.”
I Kings 1:42,"<b>the Kereitites and the Peleitites:</b> David’s personal bodyguard, made up, it appears, of mercenaries from Crete and Philistia, although the latter identification is not certain."
I Kings 1:43,"<b>Tent:</b> Probably the “Tent of Appointment,” the pre-Temple shrine, described in detail in the book of Exodus."
I Kings 1:44,"<b>pipes:</b> Or “flutes.” The Hebrew word (sing. <i>halil</i>) is onomatopoetic, and comes from a root meaning “hollow.”"
I Kings 1:45,<b>city:</b> The word used here (<i>kirya</i>) is more frequently found in poetry.
I Kings 1:46,"<b>Yonatan:</b> Trad. English “Jonathan,” not to be confused with the prince who dies at the end of I Samuel. "
I Kings 1:47,"<b>valor:</b> Or “character,” “caliber.” It can at times mean something closer to “value,” i.e., wealth. "
I Kings 1:48,"<b>you bring good news:</b> Like David in II Sam. 18, where similar wording appears, his son Adoniyyahu will be disappointed and devastated by the news he hears (Alter 1999)."
I Kings 1:49,"<b>took hold of the horns:</b> Biblical altars had projections at their four corners; as sacrificial blood was sprinkled there, they were considered the holiest part of the altar and thus were seized when people sought asylum (Walsh)."
I Kings 1:50,"<b>King Shelomo:</b> Used four times in three verses, the phrase reveals Adoniyyahu’s new point of view (Walsh)."
I Kings 1:51,<b>if any evil … :</b> Or “if he is caught in any wrongdoing” (Cogan 2001).
I Kings 2:1,<b>David’s days drew … die:</b> The Hebrew is not alliterative.
I Kings 2:2,"<b>the way of all the earth:</b> A euphemism for death.
3–4 <b>You are to keep the keeping … :</b> Probably a Deuteronomistic insertion into the text, which sounds a pious note at an otherwise bloodcurdling moment. “Keep the keeping” is a standard expression for holding to the covenant."
I Kings 2:3,<b>in my presence:</b> Or “before my face.”
I Kings 2:4,"<b>Avner … Amasa:</b> Pronounced <i>ahv-NAYR</i> and <i>ah-mah-SAH;</i> David’s perceived enemies, allied to Sha’ul. They are both killed by being stabbed in the abdomen (II Sam. 3, 20). "
I Kings 2:5,<b>brought the blood of war into peacetime:</b> Hebrew difficult; perhaps it means “shedding blood outside the context of battle.” 
I Kings 2:6,"<b>belt:</b> Recalling Yoav’s most recent murder, that of Amasa."
I Kings 2:7,"<b>worldly-wisdom:</b> In the Hebrew Bible, “wisdom” is most often practical, not intellectual, and so can include political shrewdness, as here. "
I Kings 2:8,"<b>Sheol:</b> The underworld, as a little-defined place of repose—a concept similar to that of the Greek Hades, and distinct from later Western notions of Heaven and Hell."
I Kings 2:9,"<b>Barzillai:</b> “Iron One,” David’s aged and loyal friend, who supported him during Avshalom’s revolt (II Sam. 1:2-29). "
I Kings 2:10,<b>came near to me [in friendship]:</b> Or “stood by me” (Sweeney 200).

I Kings 2:12,"<b>clear:</b> I.e., guiltless. "
I Kings 2:13,<b>in blood:</b> Alter (1) notes Shim’i’s curse hurled at David in II Sam. 16:7 (“blood-guilty man … !”).
I Kings 2:14,"<b>forty … seven … thirty-three:</b> Such patterned numbers do not attempt to portray chronology accurately. The message that significant figures lived or reigned for “perfect” lengths of time (40, 70, 120 years) was perhaps more important to the audience than historical accuracy; nevertheless, such numbers were taken as factual by generations of readers. "
I Kings 2:15,<b>Hevron:</b> Pronounced <i>hev-ROHN;</i> trad. English “Hebron.”
I Kings 2:16,<b>in peace:</b> Or “friendly.”
I Kings 2:17,<b>reversed:</b> The Hebrew verb <i>s-b-b</i> is used several times in these books to indicate a change of leadership (Machinist 1995). 
I Kings 2:18,<b>from</b> Y<small>HWH</small>: Intended by God.
I Kings 2:19,<b>turn away my face:</b> Refuse me.
I Kings 2:20,"<b>small:</b> Given the political implications of this request, it is not so small."
I Kings 2:21,<b>for him … for Evyatar … for Yoav:</b> They will get the kingdom as well. The awkward phrasing here perhaps reflects Shelomo’s emotions (Walsh).
I Kings 2:22,<b>today:</b> A theme word in these chapters. “Adonijah’s todays have run out” (Walsh).
I Kings 2:23,"<b>attacked:</b> The verb (Heb. <i>p-g-’</i>) is used four times in this chapter (parallel perhaps to the four occasions in Samuel when David’s enemies are stabbed in the abdomen). It often means “come upon,” but can also connote violence. Older translations use “smite,” which I rejected as unnecessarily archaic."
I Kings 2:24,"<b>the word:</b> See I Sam. 2:-36, where an anonymous prophet foretells the downfall of Eli’s priestly line. "
I Kings 2:25,<b>Eli:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-LEE;</i> the chief priest/leader at the beginning of the book of Samuel. 
I Kings 2:26,<b>Shilo:</b> Pronounced <i>shee-LO;</i> it was a major religious center in the north.
I Kings 2:27,<b>inclined after:</b> supported.
I Kings 2:28,"<b>was next to:</b> LXX reads “had taken hold of,” which makes more sense."
I Kings 2:29,<b>the causeless blood:</b> Or “the (guilt of) innocent blood” (Cogan 2001).
I Kings 2:30,"<b>noble:</b> Literally “good” (Heb. <i>tov</i>), which in the Hebrew Bible carries a wide range of meanings, physical and spiritual."
I Kings 2:31,<b>house:</b> Some see this as denoting a kind of mausoleum. 
I Kings 2:32,"<b>in the wilderness:</b> Alter (1999), following the medieval commentator Gersonides, raises the possibility that Yoav, as a man of violence, is deliberately buried off the beaten path."
I Kings 2:33,"<b>not to go out:</b> A difficult restriction, given the small size of Jerusalem at the time (Walsh). It amounts to house arrest."
I Kings 2:34,<b>Wadi Kidron:</b> The valley on the east side of Jerusalem; crossing it would lead him to the Mount of Olives and eventually to his estate at Bahurim.
I Kings 2:35,<b>The word is good:</b> The sentence is fair (Walsh).
I Kings 2:36,"<b>Gat:</b> Pronounced <i>GOT</i>; trad. English “Gath,” one of the five major Philistine cities near the Mediterranean coast. So Shim’i actually does not cross the Kidron, which lies in the opposite direction."
I Kings 2:37,<b>I hearken:</b> With the connotation of “I accept” (Cogan 2001). The Heb. <i>shama’ti</i> perhaps puns on the name Shim’i (Fokkelman 1981).
I Kings 2:38,<b><i>You</i> know all the evildoing that your heart knew:</b> This odd phraseology calls upon Shim’i to remember the past; his previous “evildoing” to David will now bring down the ultimate evil (or “disaster”) upon himself. 
I Kings 2:39,"<b>heart:</b> In the Hebrew Bible, it is often close to our concept of “mind.”"
I Kings 3:1,"<b>Pharaoh:</b> As usual, we are not told which king of Egypt is meant here. "
I Kings 3:2,"<b>the City of David:</b> Referring to the area south of the present Old City; Shelomo expanded the royal precinct northward, with the Temple atop what the ancients called Mount Zion (today’s Temple Mount). "
I Kings 3:3,<b>his house:</b> The Hebrew word used for both “palace” and “Temple” are the same (<i>bayit</i>) in these texts. Note which of the two is mentioned first here—a possible suggestion as to their relative importance in Shelomo’s eyes.
I Kings 3:4,"<b>the sanctuaries:</b> Traditionally rendered “high places,” this is a technical term for shrines outside of Jerusalem (a more focused translation might be “platform shrines” or, according to some, “open-air sanctuaries”). Given the strong slant of the book toward centralized worship in Jerusalem, every king who tolerates or sacrifices at them is to some extent condemned. "
I Kings 3:5,"<b>for the name of</b> Y<small>HWH</small>: In Deut. 1 and I Kings 8, in contrast to earlier literature, the Temple becomes the residence of God’s “name” rather than of the deity himself."
I Kings 3:6,"<b>sending-up-smoke:</b> The Hebrew verb, <i>k-t-r</i>, usually denotes incense (<i>ketoret</i>) offerings."
I Kings 3:7,"<b>Giv’on:</b> Trad. English “Gibeon,” located about five miles northwest of Jerusalem. See Commentary for some of its resonances."
I Kings 3:8,"<b>dream:</b> A common form of revelation in the Bible, as attested many times in Genesis."
I Kings 3:9,<b>to go out and to come in:</b> Meaning “to lead the people in battle.”
I Kings 3:10,"<b>an understanding heart:</b> Lit., “a listening heart.” As with the term “wisdom,” here the point is not merely intellectual capacity but the practical ability to make wise decisions and administer justice."
I Kings 3:11,"<b>requested:</b> The verb pointed to a major theme in the Sha’ul (“The Requested One”) story; here, it comes from the king himself and is obviously viewed favorably, since it occurs five times in v.11 alone."
I Kings 3:12,<b><i>shalom</i>-offerings:</b> A type of sacrifice that creates reconciliation and solidarity within the community. JPS and others use “offerings of well-being.”
I Kings 3:13,"<b>her insides burned:</b> The same description of strong family ties occurs when Yosef sees his younger brother Binyamin for the first time in many years (Gen. 43:30). Note that “insides” (<i>rahamim</i>) can also mean “compassion,” and the singular form <i>rehem</i> also denotes “womb.” "
I Kings 3:14,"<b>living newborn:</b> Manuscripts change the word to <i>yeled</i>, but MT has <i>yalud</i>, a term more intimately connected to “birthing” and hence a strong clue as to who the real mother is (see Walsh). "
I Kings 3:15,"<b>but death:</b> Brettler (private communication) notes that at first hearing one can also read <i>ve-ha-met</i> as “the dead one,” contrasting to “the living” one in the line above."
I Kings 3:16,<b>her:</b> The first speaker in v.26.
I Kings 3:17,<b>judgment:</b> Or “decision.”
I Kings 4:1,

I Kings 4:4,<b>Herald:</b> Possibly a royal spokesperson.
I Kings 4:5,<b>Prefects:</b> Or “governors.” 
I Kings 4:6,"<b>Friend of the King:</b> An official title, denoting the king’s chief counselor. This office is only mentioned in conjunction with the reigns of David and Shelomo."
I Kings 4:7,"<b>[The One] Over the Household:</b> Royal Steward, with duties probably extending beyond the palace itself."
I Kings 4:8,"<b>Israel:</b> From the territories listed here, the term clearly means what it does after Shelomo’s death: the northern region of the country (Walsh)."
I Kings 4:9,"<b>highlands:</b> Or “districts,” an educated guess based on the context (Cogan 2001)."
I Kings 4:10,<b>Yissakhar:</b> Trad. English “Issachar.”
I Kings 4:11,<b>Binyamin:</b> Trad. English “Benjamin.”
I Kings 4:12,<b>Gil’ad:</b> Trad. English “Gilead.” 
I Kings 4:13,"<b>in the land of … :</b> It appears that a name is missing, but is probably Judah, which begins the next verse. This would have been a fairly typical scribal error."
I Kings 4:14,"<b>Judah and Israel:</b> Owing to the reversed order, probably a later insertion (DeVries)."
I Kings 5:1,<b>all the kingdoms:</b> II Chron. 9:26 reads “kings.” 
I Kings 5:2,<b>the River:</b> The Euphrates.
I Kings 5:3,"<b><i>cors:</i></b> This measure, dry, equaled fourteen bushels, and is the equivalent of the <i>homer</i>, cited elsewhere."
I Kings 5:4,"<b>Tifsah:</b> Pronounced <i>tif-SAH</i>, a town on the Euphrates, about four hundred miles from Gaza; it was on a major trade route from Mesopotamia to the western lands."
I Kings 5:5,"<b>in security … :</b> The Bible’s classic expression of peace and prosperity, especially when combined with the imagery of sitting “beneath one’s vine and fig tree.” "
I Kings 5:6,"<b>from Dan to Be’er-Sheva:</b> The phrase might be termed a “spatial merism” (Wazana 2003), citing important sites in the north and the south to express “the whole country.” Be’er-Sheva is trad. English “Beersheba.”"
I Kings 5:7,"<b>four thousand:</b> Following Chronicles and LXX; MT has “forty,” probably a mistake (Walsh)."
I Kings 5:8,<b>pack-animals:</b> In contrast to the faster horses. 
I Kings 5:9,<b>his turn:</b> Following JPS.
I Kings 5:10,<b>Children of the East:</b> Cogan (2001) understands the term as referring to desert Arabs.
I Kings 5:11,"<b>Eitan …:</b> These names appear in conjunction with the Psalms (see 89:1), suggesting to some scholars that they were court singers / musicians. "
I Kings 5:12,"<b>fame:</b> Heb. <i>shem</i>, most often translated “name.”"
I Kings 5:13,"<b>five and a thousand:</b> LXX reads “five thousand,” but the phrase may simply mean “a thousand and more” (Walsh)."
I Kings 5:14,<b>Hiram:</b> Pronounced <i>hee-RAHM.</i> The Phoenician king’s name is probably short for “Ahiram.” 
I Kings 5:15,"<b>loved David [in covenant]:</b> The verb “love” in the Hebrew Bible can sometimes be a technical term for “be in treaty with,” “be loyal to,” as in Deut. 6:5, although Jews and Christians have traditionally taken that phrase to indicate the love of God. "
I Kings 5:16,<b>all the days:</b> Indicating ongoing time.
I Kings 5:17,<b>them:</b> Israel’s enemies. 
I Kings 5:18,<b>beneath the soles of my feet:</b> The proper position of a defeated enemy in the ancient world.
I Kings 5:19,<b>the Levanon:</b> The ‘’white” Lebanon mountain range after which the modern country is named. In the Bible it is almost always accompanied by the definite article.

I Kings 5:22,"<b>pressed:</b> By hand, and thus quite pure (see Exod. 27:20)."
I Kings 5:23,<b><i>shalom</i>/peace:</b> The word is also used to indicate “treaty loyalty” (Fishbane). Here it links up with the Israelite king’s name.
I Kings 5:24,<b>at home:</b> Lit. “in his house.”
I Kings 5:25,"<b>Giblites:</b> Men from Byblos, north of Hiram’s region on the Mediterranean coast."
I Kings 6:1,"<b>four hundred and eighty:</b> Interpreters have spent centuries trying to calculate the date of the Exodus from this, but it seems much more likely that this is another ‘’meaningful” biblical number, equaling forty times twelve or four times ten times twelve, and indicating the orderliness of God’s plan for Israel. "
I Kings 6:2,"<b>Ziv:</b> Pronounced <i>zeev</i>, the “Blossom Month,” in the spring. This designation, from the Phoenician calendar, corresponds to the Jewish month of Iyyar."
I Kings 6:3,<b>built:</b> Kimhi understands the verb as indicating “began to build.” 
I Kings 6:4,"<b>sixty … twenty … thirty:</b> As with the Tabernacle in Exodus, the measurements are highly proportional, conveying a message of symbolic perfection."

I Kings 6:6,"<b>Great-Hall:</b> The word (<i>hekhal</i>), cognate elsewhere in the ancient Near East, can indicate a large space, including also “palace” (see I Kings 21:2) and “temple.”"
I Kings 6:7,<b>extension:</b> Or “layer” (Mulder). 
I Kings 6:8,"<b>Rear-Chamber:</b> Others, “adytum,” “inner sanctuary,” identical to the “Holiest Holy-Place.” The word (<i>devir</i>) is sometimes linked to the “word” (<i>davar</i>) of God, but is probably an architectural rather than a theological term."
I Kings 6:9,<b>offsets:</b> Some kind of retaining walls seem to be meant (Sweeney 2007). 
I Kings 6:10,"<b>so as not to fasten [them]:</b> That is, the offsets do not offer extra support to the walls of the Temple (Mulder)."
I Kings 6:11,"<b>complete:</b> Others, “unhewn”; the term (<i>shalem</i>) echoes the name Shelomo, and is used elsewhere in these chapters as a verb. "
I Kings 6:12,"<b>tool of iron:</b> In the Torah, the altar was likewise forbidden to be made with iron tools (see Exod. 20:22, Deut. 2:5)."
I Kings 6:13,"<b>lowest:</b> LXX, more logically; MT reads “middle.” "
I Kings 6:14,"<b>shoulder:</b> Or “flank, side.” "
I Kings 6:15,<b>winding-stairs:</b> So understood by LXX and Targum; Mulder: “spiralshaped decorations.”
I Kings 6:16,"<b>covered:</b> The verb (<i>s-p-n</i>) means “to cover with wood,” the noun, “ceiling.” "
I Kings 6:17,<b>beam-projections:</b> Heb. unclear; Mulder conjectures “drain pipes.”
I Kings 6:18,"<b>the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came]:</b> As Fishbane notes, this expression is used most often in connection with prophets, not kings, and so is of special significance here."
I Kings 6:19,"<b>the Holiest Holy-Place:</b> Others, “Holy of Holies.”"
I Kings 6:20,<b>in front [of it]:</b> Hebrew odd; LXX has “in front of the Rear-Chamber.”
I Kings 6:21,"<b>gourds and open flowers:</b> The vegetation motif is often symbolic of life-giving in ancient Near Eastern architecture, and appeared already in conjunction with the sacred seven-branched lampstand in Exod. 25:31ff."
I Kings 6:22,<b>the forepart:</b> The text seems confused here and at the beginning of v.17 (“in front [of it]); some conjecture that vv.18-19 were inserted. 
I Kings 6:23,<b>it</b>: The Rear-Chamber. 
I Kings 6:24,"<b>refined gold:</b> Gold that is beaten out, more commonly referred to in English as gold leaf."
I Kings 6:25,"<b>winged-sphinxes:</b> Trad. English “cherubim,” not to be confused with the chubby baby angels familiar in Western art. The <i>keruvim</i> were a common symbol in the ancient Near East; imaginary, composite creatures, they appear as guardians to royal and sacred buildings. See also Exod. 25:18-20. "
I Kings 6:26,"<b>oleaster wood:</b> Lit., “oil wood.” Cogan (2001) understands it as pinewood. "
I Kings 6:27,<b>its:</b> Referring to each sphinx.
I Kings 6:28,"<b>wing:</b> MT has “wings,” but some versions read it in the singular."
I Kings 6:29,<b>palmettes:</b> The palm tree was another common symbol of life and prosperity.
I Kings 6:30,"<b>a fifth [of the wall-length]:</b> Sweeney (2007) understands <i>hamishit</i> as “five-sided,” and thus bonded for strength."
I Kings 6:31,"<b>cut cedar:</b> Beams or the like. The alternation of stone and wood was common in the ancient Near East, where it helped to cushion structures in the event of earthquakes."
I Kings 6:32,<b>the fourth year:</b> Of Shelomo’s reign.
I Kings 6:33,"<b>moon:</b> Heb. <i>yerah</i>, an older term for “month.” "
I Kings 6:34,"<b>Bul:</b> The “Rain Month,” roughly October. It corresponds to the Jewish month of Marheshvan. "
I Kings 6:35,"<b>seven years:</b> Seven is usually the measure of perfection in the Bible. Yet note that in the next verse, we are told that Shelomo spent thirteen years on his own house (palace), making this “seven” look less significant."
I Kings 7:1,
I Kings 7:2,"<b>House of the Forest of the Levanon:</b> Whatever its function (probably for assembly), it must have been quite impressive, judging from the image conjured up by the name. "
I Kings 7:3,"<b>cut cedarwork:</b> Apparently these were beams, placed to support the roof."
I Kings 7:4,"<b>sight line toward sight line:</b> The Hebrew is obscure, perhaps indicating facing windows."
I Kings 7:5,"<b>pronounce judgment:</b> Others, “rule.” "
I Kings 7:6,"<b>floor to floor:</b> We would use “floor to ceiling,” and ancient versions have the latter."
I Kings 7:7,"<b>pattern:</b> Or “construction.” The word comes from the verb “to make,” so frequently used in these chapters. "
I Kings 7:8,"<b>he was [also] to make:</b> This took place later, but in Walsh’s view has been placed here to emphasize that Shelomo built it before the Temple."
I Kings 7:9,"<b>Hiram:</b> Not to be confused with King Hiram, who supplied building materials to Shelomo earlier in the text. In II Chron. 2:, he is called Huram Avi, “My Father is [the god] Horon.”"
I Kings 7:10,<b>Naftali:</b> Whose territory was next to that of Tyre. 
I Kings 7:11,"<b>engraver in bronze:</b> Others, “coppersmith.” "
I Kings 7:12,"<b>he was filled …</b>: The description echoes that of the Tabernacle architect, Betzalel, in Exod. 31:3 and 35:31. "
I Kings 7:13,"<b>make:</b> Here, as in the Tabernacle accounts in Exodus, the verb recurs in this chapter in various forms."
I Kings 7:14,<b>a cord … [able to] go around:</b> Describing the circumference. 
I Kings 7:15,"<b>and so:</b> Emending <i>et</i> to <i>oto ve-khen</i>, as suggested in ancient versions."
I Kings 7:16,<b>networks:</b> Some suggest that the words “he made” are missing here.
I Kings 7:17,"<b>pomegranates … columns:</b> According to ancient versions, sensibly; MT reverses them (the words are <i>rimmonim</i> and <i>’ammudim</i>)."
I Kings 7:18,"<b>bulging-section:</b> Lit., “belly.”"
I Kings 7:19,"<b>columns:</b> In the Roman period, the [Second] Temple’s two columns became a central symbol of Judaism, and their image is found on coins made during the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135 <small>C.E.</small>). Their origin may be Canaanite, with connotations of fertility, attributable to the phallic shape and the inclusion of pomegranates (Mulder). And the unusual names attached to them may also reflect ancient Near Eastern practice, where pillars were accompanied by inscriptions of prayers. The names here would have been the opening words of a phrase like “In strength He establishes (or: May He establish) [the earth].”"
I Kings 7:20,"<b>Sea-Basin:</b> Scholars disagree on whether this object had mythic overtones, symbolizing the primeval waters of chaos brought under control by Y<small>HWH</small> (see, for instance, Ps. 104:6-9), or was merely a place for the priests to wash. Perhaps it was both. JPS uses the inelegant “tank.”"
I Kings 7:21,<b>inward:</b> Facing inside.
I Kings 7:22,<b>handbreadth:</b> About three inches (Gray 1970). 
I Kings 7:23,"<b><i>baht</i>-measures:</b> A fluid measure equal perhaps to six gallons. Most translations use “baths,” to which English word this concept is unrelated."

I Kings 7:26,<b>enclosures:</b> Apparently describing rims or frames.
I Kings 7:27,<b>shoulder-pieces:</b> Or “supports.”
I Kings 7:28,<b>supports:</b> Lit. “hands”; Cogan (2001) renders “axletrees.”
I Kings 7:29,"<b>from … [itself came]:</b> Or idiomatically, ‘‘were of one piece with.” This formulation is used frequently in the Tabernacle texts of Exodus."
I Kings 7:30,"<b>according to the bare space … :</b> Heb. obscure, just like v.30’s “cast across from each one in spirals” (Cogan 2001)."
I Kings 7:31,<b>four by the cubit:</b> In diameter.
I Kings 7:32,<b>pots:</b> LXX; MT has “basins.” 
I Kings 7:33,"<b>finished:</b> A key word in both the Creation (Gen. 2:1-2) and Tabernacle (Exod. :33) accounts, undoubtedly meant to connect the two."
I Kings 7:34,<b>in thick soil:</b> Or “in clay molds.”
I Kings 7:35,<b>left … [unweighed]:</b> Following JPS.
I Kings 7:36,<b>House … Great-Hall:</b> LXX omits “House.”
I Kings 7:37,"<b>completed:</b> Here the text uses, not the usual “finished” (<i>k-l-h</i>), but <i>sh-l-m</i> again, as in 6:7. Cogan (2001) notes that “finished” seems to be used here to designate parts of the work, as in vv.9, 14, and 38 (and 7:1 and 40). "
I Kings 7:38,<b>holy-objects:</b> Spoils of war and gifts that were deposited in the sanctuary.
I Kings 8:1,"<b>leaders:</b> Lit., “exalted ones.” "
I Kings 8:2,"<b>Zion:</b> Heb. <i>Tziyyon</i>, the hill on which the Temple was built. What is today called Mount Zion is in fact located some distance southwest of the original Temple Mount."
I Kings 8:3,"<b>Ever-Flowing:</b> In the fall, the month at whose end it begins to rain in Israel. It was later (and still is today) called Tishre. "
I Kings 8:4,"<b>the Festival:</b> Sukkot (“Huts”), the pilgrimage festival that takes place after all the harvests are concluded. It was the most important of ancient Israel’s agricultural holidays, and hence is referred to as “<i>The</i> Festival” in the Bible."
I Kings 8:5,"<b>the priests and the Levites:</b> The fact that they share the same duties may indicate a late date for this part of the chapter, since in the Exodus texts relating to the Tabernacle their tasks are quite separate (Gray 1970)."
I Kings 8:6,<b>sphinxes:</b> Elsewhere translated as “winged-sphinxes.”

I Kings 8:10,"<b>Horev:</b> Another name for Mount Sinai.
10-11 <b>the cloud … the Glory of Y<small>HWH</small> had filled the House of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The language recalls Moshe, making Shelomo an idealized figure beyond his own time, the “Moses of the monarchy” (Fishbane)."
I Kings 8:11,"<b>Glory:</b> Cogan (2001) prefers “essence, presence.”"
I Kings 8:12,"<b>determined:</b> Or “said.” Heb. <i>’-m-r</i> can encompass a wide range of concepts beyond speaking, including thinking and intending."
I Kings 8:13,"<b>I have built:</b> The first of six occurrences of this phrase in the chapter, pointing to the king’s “personal piety” (Zevit 2004)."
I Kings 8:14,"<b>promised:</b> Usually rendered “spoke” in this translation, but as “promised,” it is a key idea in this chapter. "
I Kings 8:15,"<b>confirmed:</b> Heb. “filled”; others, “fulfilled with his hand.”"
I Kings 8:16,<b>I have not chosen a city:</b> Shelomo thus eliminates the claims of other locations for the Ark or a sanctuary (Sweeney 2007).
I Kings 8:17,<b>in the heart:</b> Or “in the mind.”
I Kings 8:18,"<b>promised:</b> Others, “predicted.” "
I Kings 8:19,"<b>I have arisen … and have taken seat:</b> LXX sets these words in the third person, undoubtedly out of a pious impulse. But perhaps we are meant to see Shelomo as self-centered here (Walsh)."
I Kings 8:20,"<b>toward the place:</b> Implying exile, and thus another indicator of compositional layering in this chapter."
I Kings 8:21,"<b>early-rain:</b> The heavy rains of late fall, crucial for fertility. "
I Kings 8:22,<b>you afflicted them:</b> Slightly emended from MT: “you answer them.”

I Kings 8:24,"<b>any prayer, any plea:</b> Heb. <i>kol ha-tefilla, kol ha-tehinna.</i> "
I Kings 8:25,"<b>spreads his palms:</b> In prayer. This posture is typically biblical, as opposed to the later, oft-drawn pose of clasped hands."
I Kings 8:26,"<b>your [royal] seat:</b> Or “your dwelling,” which fits equally well here."
I Kings 8:27,"<b>may <i>you</i> hearken:</b> Some manuscripts and Chronicles read, as in earlier paragraphs, “Then may you hearken…”"
I Kings 8:28,"<b>toward:</b> Heb. <i>derekh</i>, the same word as “the road” in the previous phrase."
I Kings 8:29,"<b>turn their heart:</b> As in “having a change of heart.” The verse plays on <i>shuv</i>, “turn/return” and <i>shavoh</i>, “take-captive, deport.”"
I Kings 8:30,"<b>iron furnace</b>: A furnace used for smelting iron; this symbolic image of Egyptian bondage is used elsewhere in the Bible (for instance, Deut. 4:20 and Jer. 11:4)."
I Kings 8:31,<b>Moshe your servant:</b> A description of Moshe found mainly in Deuteronomy and later texts.
I Kings 8:32,"<b>failed:</b> Lit., “fallen.”"
I Kings 8:33,<b>need:</b> Elsewhere translated “portion.”

I Kings 8:35,"<b>fat parts:</b> Considered the choicest parts of the sacrifice, and hence reserved for God (see Lev. 3:14-16, and also the story of Kayin and Hevel [Cain and Abel] in Gen. 4)."
I Kings 8:36,"<b>Levo-Hamat:</b> The “Entrance of Hamat,” some fifty miles north of Damascus. "
I Kings 8:37,"<b>Y<small>HWH</small> our God:</b> As Cogan (2001) points out, this phrase, common in Deuteronomy, is unprecedented here. “Our” has the effect of bringing the audience into the scene."

I Kings 9:6,"<b>reproach:</b> Heb. <i>shenina</i>, from a verb denoting “sharp.”"
I Kings 9:7,"<b>a ruin:</b> MT has Heb. <i>’elyon</i>, “exalted,” undoubtedly, even though it makes little sense, to substitute a euphemism for what versions rightly read as <i>le-’iyyin.</i> "
I Kings 9:8,<b>whistle:</b> In amazement.
I Kings 9:9,<b>brother: A</b> treaty term for an equal partner.
I Kings 9:10,"<b>talents:</b> Heb. <i>kikkar</i>, a “round thing,” the heaviest unit of weight in the Bible."
I Kings 9:11,"<b>Earthfill:</b> This reference, which occurs a number of times in Samuel and Kings, seems to be to a supporting structure used by Israel’s kings in the building up of Jerusalem. It is often identified with the “Stepped Stone Structure” unearthed just south of the present Old City of Jerusalem. "
I Kings 9:12,"<b>Hatzor:</b> Pronounced <i>hah-TZOR;</i> trad. English “Hazor,” a city north of the Sea of Galilee, on two major trade routes. Its ruins have recently been the site of considerable archaeological activity. "
I Kings 9:13,"<b>Megiddo:</b> Pronounced <i>meh-gee-DOE.</i> Situated at a pass which gives access to major movements of traders and troops from eastern empires down through the Coastal Plain, this was the site of crucial battles throughout antiquity. Its name of the “Hill of Megiddo,” <i>Har Megiddo</i>, has entered the English language as ‘Armageddon”—the Final Battle mentioned in the New Testament (Rev. 16:16) and a general catchword for the end of the world. "
I Kings 9:14,"<b>Gezer:</b> Pronounced <i>GEH-zer.</i> In the foothills west of Jerusalem, not far from modern Ramleh, it controlled yet another route of access: to the Coastal Plain from Jerusalem and the highlands. Thus the three cities mentioned in this verse were of signal strategic importance, and all three have left evidence of almost identical massive buildings, containing chambered gates with casemate walls. Many archaeologists connect these with the period of Shelomo (tenth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), although some date them later."
I Kings 9:15,<b>sendoff-gift:</b> Some understand this as “dowry.”
I Kings 9:16,"<b>Bet-Horon:</b> This town allows access to Jerusalem from the west; as Gray (1970) notes, it was strategically important in the later Hasmonean (second century <small>B.C.E.</small>) and Roman (first century <small>C.E.</small>) wars."
I Kings 9:17,"<b>Baalat… Tadmor:</b> The identification is uncertain, but it is likely, on the analogy of the previous verses, that these too were strategic sites. The rendering “Tadmor” for MT “Tamar” is based on ancient versions and II Chron. 8:4, and makes more sense, given that it is inside the land of Israel like the other locations on the list (Cogan 2001). "
I Kings 9:18,<b>[of Judah]:</b> The hanging “land of” in MT does not make sense.
I Kings 9:19,<b>Amorites … :</b> Mentioned often in the Torah as a term for the indigenous peoples of Canaan.
I Kings 9:20,"<b>slave:</b> Heb. <i>’eved</i>, elsewhere rendered “servant” or “serf.”"
I Kings 9:21,"<b>steed-riders:</b> This might be a late text, or from a later perspective; cavalry seems not to have been in use at this point in Israel’s history."
I Kings 9:22,<b>these:</b> A list seems to be missing here.
I Kings 9:23,<b>kept… [in] complete [repair]:</b> It is not clear what is meant here. Others: “paid [vows].’’ Kimhi understands the phrase as meaning “he completed the arrangements for the Temple rituals.” The Heb. <i>shillem</i> also puns with “<i>shalom</i>-offerings” (<i>shelamim</i>) and “Shelomo” (Walsh).
I Kings 9:24,"<b>Etzyon-Gever:</b> On the Gulf of Aqaba, and hence an outlet for trade with Africa and/or India. "
I Kings 9:25,"<b>Reed Sea:</b> Others, “Red Sea” (not the same as the famous site in Exodus), “Gulf of Aqaba,” or even “Endmost Sea” (reading <i>sof</i> for <i>suf</i>)."
I Kings 9:26,<b>Ofir:</b> Possibly in southwest Arabia.
I Kings 10:1,"<b>Sheba:</b> Trad. English; Heb. “Sh’va.” It is identified as today’s country of Yemen, in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. "
I Kings 10:2,"<b>Sheba, Shelomo … she:</b> The Hebrew is even more alliterative, with <i>u-malkat sh’va shomaat et sheima shelomo le-sheim Y<small>HWH</small>.</i> I was tempted to use “shining-reports” in the translation, for that reason. "
I Kings 10:3,<b>for the fame of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> It is not entirely clear what is meant here; it probably points to Y<small>HWH</small> as the source of Shelomo’s success (see Cogan 2001). 
I Kings 10:4,"<b>riddles:</b> Cogan (2001) elevates this to “difficult questions,” since “riddles” may have too light a connotation in modern culture."
I Kings 10:5,"<b>words:</b> Others, “problems,” “questions.” "
I Kings 10:6,<b>hidden:</b> Or “obscure.”
I Kings 10:7,"<b>House:</b> Once again, the word could refer to either the Temple or the royal palace; it appears logically to be the latter."
I Kings 10:8,"<b>she was left breathless:</b> Following JPS; it might also be rendered, “It took her breath away.” Curiously, the same expression is used to describe the Canaanites in fear right before the conquest of Jericho (see Josh. :1)."
I Kings 10:9,<b>way-with-words:</b> Following B-R.
I Kings 10:10,"<b>bounty:</b> Lit., “good things.”"
I Kings 10:11,<b>men:</b> Some ancient versions read “women.”

I Kings 10:16,"<b><i>minas:</i></b> Weights of fifty <i>shekels</i>, according to Ezek. 45:12. As with many biblical measures, an accurate modern equivalent is difficult to calculate."
I Kings 10:17,"<b>throne of ivory:</b> Most likely, inlaid with ivory."
I Kings 10:18,<b>rounded top:</b> Some suggest a “calf’s head.”
I Kings 10:19,"<b>Tarshish:</b> Either a geographic location, either Spain or somewhere further east in the Mediterranean, or else a general designation for the smelting of metals. In the latter case, “ships of Tarshish” would be large ships designed to transport metals (see Isa. 2:16, Ezek. 27:25). "
I Kings 10:20,<b>tusks … :</b> The identification is not clear; perhaps exotic animals are purposely included (Walsh).
I Kings 10:21,"<b>all the earth:</b> versions add “the kings of,” as in v.23."
I Kings 10:22,"<b>put:</b> MT reads “led,” which is a bit strange."
I Kings 10:23,"<b>like stones … like sycamores … in abundance:</b> That is, as widespread as these common substances."
I Kings 10:24,"<b>Egypt:</b> Heb. <i>mitzrayim</i>, but some propose Mutzri, north of the Taurus Mountains. "
I Kings 10:25,"<b>Kue:</b> On the coast of today’s Turkey, south of the Taurus Mountains, it was later known as Cilicia."

I Kings 10:27,"<b>by their [own] hand:</b> That is, by the agency of Shelomo’s traders."
I Kings 11:1,"<b>foreign:</b> The word is omitted in LXX, along with v.3’s “and his wives inclined away his heart.”"
I Kings 11:2,"<b>clung in love:</b> The phrase seems to point to the women, but “clung” is also used in the Bible to refer to the worship of gods (Walsh)."
I Kings 11:3,"<b>complete:</b> Heb. <i>shalem</i>, playing on Shelomo’s name as one whose heart was <i>not</i> “complete” with God."
I Kings 11:4,"<b>Astarte:</b> The name of a goddess or group of goddesses, found throughout the ancient Near East in various forms, and corresponding to the Greek Aphrodite and the planet Venus. The Hebrew form <i>Ashtoret</i> uses the vowels of the word <i>bosket</i>, “shame,” to fill out what may originally have been ‘Astart.” Similarly constructed are a number of other biblical names for pagan gods—such as “the Molekh” (for Malik), and “Kemosh” (using the vowels of <i>be’osh</i>, “stench,” for Kamish), both in v.7. "
I Kings 11:5,"<b>godhead:</b> Tellingly, biblical Hebrew has no word for “goddess.”"
I Kings 11:6,<b>faces:</b> Others “east of.” 
I Kings 11:7,"<b>Molekh:</b> Pronounced <i>MOlekh.</i> Possibly a god, and often associated in Kings with child sacrifice. LXX, though, reads “Milkom” here."
I Kings 11:8,"<b>him:</b> Added, following ancient versions."
I Kings 11:9,<b>was your [intention]:</b> Or “in your mind.” 
I Kings 11:10,<b>tear… away:</b> The same language used regarding Sha’ul’s forfeiting the kingship in I Sam. 15:28.
I Kings 11:11,"<b>one tribe:</b> Yehuda. Perhaps Binyamin is also understood as included, to make the overall tribal division ten plus two."
I Kings 11:12,"<b>adversary:</b> The Hebrew word, <i>satan</i>, later developed into familiar “Satan“; here it denotes only a human being. "
I Kings 11:13,"<b>Hadad:</b> A theophoric name (containing the name of a deity), using that of a well-known storm god worshipped by the Arameans. "
I Kings 11:14,"<b>royal seed:</b> I.e., royal family."

I Kings 11:16,"<b>Hadad:</b> In this case, MT spells as ‘Adad.”"
I Kings 11:17,"<b>the <i>Tah’penes:</i></b> Pronounced <i>tah-pe-NACE.</i> The meaning in Egyptian indicates a title, “wife of the king.”"
I Kings 11:18,"<b>Genuvat:</b> Pronounced <i>ge-noo-VAHT.</i> It possibly means “stranger” or “outsider,” like Moshe’s son Gershom (Exod. 2:22). The whole verse is reminiscent of the Moshe story. "
I Kings 11:19,<b>weaned:</b> LXX reads “brought up.”
I Kings 11:20,<b>Rezon:</b> Possibly meaning “dignitary.” 
I Kings 11:21,"<b>Elyada:</b> “God Knows”—an ironic allusion to the “know” theme in Chaps. 1-2, which were also concerned with succession to the throne. "
I Kings 11:22,<b>Tzova:</b> South of Damascus.
I Kings 11:23,"<b>when David was killing them:</b> Here, as in most translations, this phrase is understood as having been misplaced in v., where it stands in MT. The incident referred to occurs in II Sam. 8. "

I Kings 11:26,<b>felt loathing at:</b> JPS: “repudiated.”
I Kings 11:27,<b>Yorov’am:</b> Some read as “Yarov’am”; trad. English “Jeroboam.” It means either “May God [lit. ‘the kinsman’] Be Great” or “May the People [kin] Increase.” 
I Kings 11:28,<b>Efratite:</b> From the northern tribe of Efrayim. 
I Kings 11:29,"<b>Tzerua:</b> The sound of the name echoes the skin disease <i>tzaraat</i>, which in the Bible is often seen as reflecting wrongdoing. So its use may be intentional here, given Yorov’am’s low standing in the eyes of the author(s) of Kings. "
I Kings 11:30,"<b>raised a hand:</b> That is, rebelled."
I Kings 11:31,<b>burden-force:</b> Walsh and others understand this to refer to porters or haulers. 
I Kings 11:32,"<b>the House of Yosef:</b> The northern region, which was shortly to become the kingdom of Israel."
I Kings 11:33,<b>Ahiyya:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-hee-YAH;</i> trad. English ‘Ahijah.” It means “Yah (Y<small>HWH</small>) Is My Brother.” 
I Kings 11:34,"<b>Shilonite:</b> From the town of Shilo in the highlands of Efrayim, an important religious center in premonarchic days. "
I Kings 11:35,"<b>new:</b> Typically in folk literature and ancient religion, what is new has magical properties or can even be considered holy.
31-32 <b>ten … one:</b> See the note to v.13 above. LXX and other versions read “two” for the second number."
I Kings 11:36,<b>he …:</b> Following ancient versions; MT has “they.”
I Kings 11:37,"<b>exalted-leader:</b> Or “chief” (Heb. <i>nasi</i>). Since this old term is not exactly synonymous with “king,” our verse may be a subtle demoting of Shelomo (Gray 1970)."
I Kings 11:38,"<b>lamp:</b> Found also in 15:4 and II Kings 8:19, this term (Heb. <i>ner</i>) is taken to indicate either dynasty continuity or dominion (<i>nir</i>) in recent scholarship."
I Kings 11:39,"<b>this:</b> Presumably, Shelomo’s deeds."
I Kings 11:40,<b>Shishak:</b> Pronounced <i>shee-SHOCK.</i> Shoshenq I (late tenth century) was the founder of Egypt’s Twenty-Second Dynasty.
I Kings 11:41,"<b>Record of the Events:</b> Affairs of state; Cogan (2001), “History.” Shelomo is the only king to have his own personal book of annals thus cited."
I Kings 11:42,<b>forty:</b> The standard “magical” number again.
I Kings 11:43,<b>Rehav’am:</b> Pronounced <i>reh-hav-AHM;</i> meaning either “God [the Kinsman] Has Caused Expansion” or “The People [Kin] Has Expanded”; trad. English “Rehoboam.” Cogan (2001) notes how both his and Yorov’am’s names may point to the prosperity of the Solomonic era.
I Kings 12:1,"<b>Shekhem:</b> This city, today’s Nablus, about sixty miles north of Jerusalem, is prominently featured in biblical narratives from Genesis through Judges, and was a major cultic center."
I Kings 12:2,"<b>returned:</b> MT has “lived in” (Heb. <i>va-yeshev</i>), but the “returned” (<i>va-yoshav</i>) reflected in LXX and II Chron. 10: better echoes the theme word of Chaps. 1-13."
I Kings 12:3,"<b>speak good words:</b> Often understood as “kind words,” but in the language of the ancient Near East, including the Bible, this expression denotes concluding a covenant (Weinfeld 2000; see also the Comment to II Sam. :28, above)."
I Kings 12:4,"<b>abandoned:</b> The same word used above in 11:33, to describe his father Shelomo’s faithlessness toward God."
I Kings 12:5,"<b>little-thing:</b> Others, “little finger,” but the entire phrase makes equal sense as a sexual reference."
I Kings 12:6,<b>“scorpions”:</b> Perhaps more elaborate devices than the whips mentioned earlier in the verse.
I Kings 12:7,<b>fulfill:</b> Or “confirm.” 
I Kings 12:8,"<b>his word:</b> See 11:31ff., where Ahiyya the prophet foretells the split."
I Kings 12:9,<b>What portion … :</b> Parallel to the words of the rebel Sheva son of Bikhri in II Sam. 20:1. Probably there had been an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the rule of the Davidic dynasty all along (Gray 1970).
I Kings 12:10,"<b>Adoram:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-doe-RAHM.</i> Earlier “Adoniram.” As Gray (1970) points out, he is the wrong choice as envoy in this situation. "
I Kings 12:11,<b>managed:</b> Others: “with effort.”
I Kings 12:12,"<b>rebelled:</b> Cogan/Tadmor note that the verb used for rebellion here, Heb. <i>p-sh-’</i>, carries legal and religious overtones (a vassal rebelling against his lord), as contrasted with the more standard <i>m-r-d</i>, “revolt,” used elsewhere. "
I Kings 12:13,<b>until this day:</b> So this part of the text would predate the destruction of the Northern Kingdom in 722.
I Kings 12:14,"<b>Community:</b> Some kind of representative body, probably of nobles or tribal leaders."
I Kings 12:15,"<b>Shema’ya:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Hearkens,” which is ironic given the use of the verb in this chapter (vv.15,16, 25)."
I Kings 12:16,<b>go up:</b> The verb often implies “to attack” (Cogan 2001).
I Kings 12:17,<b>Efrayim:</b> Although Shekhem was properly in the territory of Menashe. This may mean that “Efrayim” is more than merely a tribal designation (Gray 1970). 
I Kings 12:18,<b>held seat:</b> Ruled. 
I Kings 12:19,<b>Penuel:</b> On the Jabbok. east of the Jordan; so its fortification would have helped secure Yorov’am’s control of the territory of Gil’ad (Gilead).
I Kings 12:20,<b>Rehav’am king of Judah:</b> The full title reflects Yorov’am’s insecurity (Walsh).
I Kings 12:21,<b>sought advice:</b> The second instance of receiving bad counsel in this chapter. 
I Kings 12:22,<b>to them:</b> To the Israelites.
I Kings 12:23,<b>Bet-El… Dan:</b> The southern and northern reaches of the Northern Kingdom.
I Kings 12:24,"<b>went before the one, as far as Dan:</b> Presumably “before the one near Bet-El and” has dropped out in MT. Cogan (2001) suggests the present reading, demonstrating the people’s enthusiasm for the new form of worship."
I Kings 12:25,<b>eighth month:</b> A month after the usual New Year’s festival. 
I Kings 12:26,"<b>the Festival:</b> See note to 8:2, above."
I Kings 12:27,"<b>went up:</b> Others, “offered whole offerings on.” The verb seems to indicate the king’s direct participation in the ritual. "

I Kings 13:2,<b>he called:</b> The subject is the man of God.

I Kings 13:4,"<b>Yoshiyyahu:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-shee-YAH-hoo;</i> trad. English “Josiah.” The meaning of the name is uncertain; proposals range from “Y<small>HWH</small> Will Grant” and “Y<small>HWH</small> Will Protect” to “Y<small>HWH</small> Makes Forget.” Although not etymologically related, it also recalls “Yehoshua” (Joshua). The prophecy will be fulfilled in II Kings 23:16. "
I Kings 13:5,<b>human bones will he burn:</b> Thus rendering the site ritually polluted (<i>tamei</i>).

I Kings 13:15,"<b>Shomeron:</b> Pronounced <i>sho-meh-ROHN;</i> trad. English “Samaria,” the northern capital (which will not be named until Chap. 16!). Here it appears to refer to a region, rather unusually for the Bible."

I Kings 13:19,<b>effacing … erasing:</b> Heb. <i>le-hakhhid ul’hashmid.</i> [it]: The dynasty of Yorov’am.
I Kings 14:1,<b>At [about] that time:</b> A formula that often serves to link different sections in the editing process. 
I Kings 14:2,<b>Aviyya:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Is Father.” Trad. English “Abijah.”

I Kings 14:8,"<b>[even] those fettered and forsaken:</b> Even the lowest members of society. Some see the phrase as connoting opposites, namely, “[whether] fettered or free.” "
I Kings 14:9,"<b>as a ball of dung is burned:</b> Dung was used as fuel in the ancient world. “Burned” here is a homonym, or maybe even identical, to the verb “eradicate” earlier in the verse (Heb. <i>bi’er</i>)."
I Kings 14:10,"<b>dogs:</b> Wild, not domesticated ones. "
I Kings 14:11,<b>dogs … birds … will eat:</b> Identical curses appear elsewhere in ancient Near Eastern treaties.

I Kings 14:15,<b>Ashera-poles:</b> The goddess was often worshipped through these objects.
I Kings 14:16,"<b>on account of:</b> Heb. <i>biglal</i>, perhaps a double pun with “dung” (<i>galal</i>, v.10) and “Illicit-Things” (<i>gillulim</i>) elsewhere. "
I Kings 14:17,"<b>which he caused Israel to sin:</b> Variations on this phrase (including “who caused Israel to sin”) will occur subsequently some twenty times in the book, as an obsessive theme."
I Kings 14:18,"<b>Tirtza:</b> Trad. English “Tirzah,” it was some six miles northeast of Shekhem, and for a time the capital of the Northern Kingdom."
I Kings 14:19,"<b>Record of Yearly Events:</b> Or “Matters“; this is a literal translation of what was traditionally rendered “Book of the Chronicles.” The phrase occurs thirty-four times in Kings. Other documents in this vein have not been found in Israel, but the general designation was a common one in the ancient world."
I Kings 14:20,<b>Nadav:</b> “[God is] Noble.”
I Kings 14:21,<b>Now:</b> JPS understands as “meanwhile.”
I Kings 14:22,<b>Judah:</b> LXX and versions read “Rehav’am.”
I Kings 14:23,"<b>[male] prostitutes:</b> Lit., “sacred ones.” Despite older scholarly theories, it is now accepted that they were not performing religious rites of a sexual nature, but may have been engaging in prostitution to pay back religious vows. However, the text is also polemical, so accuracy may not be the issue here."
I Kings 14:24,"<b>Shishak:</b> See note to 11:40, above. The invasion referred to here is mentioned on the wall of Amun-Re’s temple at Karnak, and a victory stele of Shoshenq has been found at Megiddo."
I Kings 14:25,<b>all the days:</b> Meaning “all those years.” 
I Kings 14:26,<b>his mother’s name …</b> : This sentence is missing in LXX and Chronicles. 
I Kings 14:27,"<b>Aviyyam:</b> Trad. English “Abijam.” Possibly a variation on “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Father” (the alternative explanation, that Yamm, the Canaanite god of the sea, is included here, is unlikely). "
I Kings 14:28,"<b>Avishalom:</b> A variant form of the name Avshalom (Absalom). If he is identical to the celebrated son of David from II Samuel, a more appropriate rendering of <i>bat</i> (here, “daughter”) would be “granddaughter.”"
I Kings 15:1,
I Kings 15:2,
I Kings 15:3,"<b>He walked / in all the sins …:</b> Here the usual formulaic evaluation of kings in the book of Kings first appears fully, making clear that the writer/editor is “more concerned over piety than politics” (Mann)."
I Kings 15:4,"<b>stand:</b> Or “endure,” “survive.”"
I Kings 15:5,<b>save in the matter of Uriyya:</b> See II Sam. 11-12 for this key story of David’s committing adultery and murder. Evidently the tradition was too well known to be ignored in our passage.
I Kings 15:6,<b>there was war … :</b> LXX and others omit; clearly there has been a scribal mix-up (see 14:40 and 15:7).
I Kings 15:7,"<b>mother … Maakha:</b> This does not square with the previous king, whose mother bears the same name—so possibly “grandmother” or “Queen Mother” is meant (Gray 1970)."
I Kings 15:8,"<b>Illicit-Things:</b> Heb. <i>gillulim</i>, perhaps related to Akkadian <i>gillatu</i> (crime), but also suggesting Hebrew words for “dung,” so that here, as is common in the Bible, idolatry is understood pejoratively."
I Kings 15:9,"<b>Horrid-Thing:</b> Some kind of idol is meant here. In modern Hebrew usage the word means “monster,” and is the name of a well-known and playful metal sculpture in contemporary Jerusalem."
I Kings 15:10,"<b>were not removed:</b> Gray (1970), quoting Noth, feels that the text goes a bit easy on this southern king, since he is not held personally responsible for failing to removing the idols."
I Kings 15:11,<b>his own holy-objects:</b> Reading according to the <i>Ketiv.</i>
I Kings 15:12,"<b>Rama:</b> Five miles north of Jerusalem, in a strategic location."
I Kings 15:13,"<b>and in:</b> A small emendation from “and,” based on ancient versions."
I Kings 15:14,<b>Iyyon … Dan … Avel Bet-Maakha:</b> Towns in the northern part of Israel. 
I Kings 15:15,<b>Kinneret:</b> The “lyreshaped” Sea of Galilee (known also as Lake Tiberias today).

I Kings 15:17,"<b>mustered:</b> Lit., “had them hearken.” "
I Kings 15:18,<b>carried away the stones of Rama:</b> Thus moving his border two miles north into Israel (see Zevit 2004).
I Kings 15:19,<b>sick in his feet:</b> LXX adds: “He did what was evil and became …”
I Kings 15:20,"<b>Yehoshafat:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Judges/Leads”; trad. English “Jehoshaphat,” remembered in English chiefly through the mid-nineteenth-century exclamation “Jumpin’Jehosaphat!,” which mercifully has no connection to any biblical events."
I Kings 15:21,<b>Nadav:</b> Pronounced <i>nah-DAHV;</i> trad. English “Nadab.”
I Kings 15:22,"<b>Ahiyya:</b> Obviously not the same as the prophet above, but his name serves to recall those prophecies (Walsh). "
I Kings 15:23,"<b>Gibbeton:</b> A town on the western edge of the hill-country of Judah, not far from Gezer. It was occupied by the tribe of Dan, and later by the Philistines."
I Kings 16:1,"<b>Yehu:</b> Pronounced <i>yay-HOO;</i> trad. English “Jehu.” The name means “Y<small>HWH</small> Is He,” appropriate given Yehu’s purge of the idolatrous house of Omri."
I Kings 16:2,<b>his:</b> The reading of LXX; MT has “your.”
I Kings 16:3,<b>of Ba’sha:</b> Of his family.
I Kings 16:4,<b>Ela:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-LAH.</i>
I Kings 16:5,<b>because he had struck it down:</b> Heb. unclear.
I Kings 16:6,"<b>Zimri:</b> The narrative will now include three would-be kings: Zimri, Omri, and Tivni, all with the accent on the last syllable. Their deeds do not match their melodious sound."
I Kings 16:7,"<b>blood-redeemers:</b> That is, family members responsible for avenging the death of a relative."
I Kings 16:8,"<b>futilities:</b> Or “emptinesses,” from <i>hevel</i>, “vapor,” referring to other gods, who were viewed by the writers as insubstantial. The Heb. word <i>hevel</i> is used at the famous opening of Ecclesiastes, “Vanity of vanities” (KJV)."
I Kings 16:9,<b>acquired:</b> Through purchase.
I Kings 16:10,"<b>Ah’av:</b> Pronounced <i>akh-AHV;</i> trad. English “Ahab.” The name combines two words that mean “father” and “brother,” or “kinsman,” but which in proper names often are taken to indicate a god."
I Kings 16:11,<b>son of Omri:</b> The repetition highlights the evil dynasty (Walsh).
I Kings 16:12,"<b>Izevel:</b> The name (pronounced <i>ee-ZEH-vel</i>), like I-Khavod in I Sam. 4:21, may be a negative judgment in Hebrew (lit., “Where is the Exalted One?”). Cogan (2001) understands it as a standard West Semitic “Zebul [Baal] Exists.” The trad. English is “Jezebel.” "
I Kings 16:13,"<b>Etbaal:</b> Phoenician “Ittobaal,” “Baal Exists.”"
I Kings 16:14,"<b>with Aviram … Seguv:</b> That is, with the loss of his sons. The reiteration and fulfillment of an old curse (Josh. 6:26) puts Ah’av’s reign in an even more negative light. "
I Kings 16:15,<b>doors:</b> Of the gates. 
I Kings 16:16,<b>Yehoshua:</b> Trad. English “Joshua.”
I Kings 17:1,<b>Eliyyahu:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-lee-YAH-hoo;</i> trad. English “Elijah.” 
I Kings 17:2,"<b>Tishbite … Gil’ad:</b> The location of Eliyyahu’s hometown is cloudy, but Gil’ad (Gilead) was the large area held by the Israelites to the east of the Jordan and north of Ammon. <i>Tishbi</i> (“Tishbite”) also resembles <i>toshavei</i>, the “settled-folk” of the verse. "
I Kings 17:3,<b>before whom I stand:</b> As faithful servant. 
I Kings 17:4,"<b>rain:</b> Specifically, the heavy rains of late fall and early winter."
I Kings 17:5,"<b>Kerit:</b> East of the Jordan, opposite Jericho. "
I Kings 17:6,"<b>which faces:</b> That is, from the east."
I Kings 17:7,<b>ravens:</b> The trickster figures of folklore around the world. Here they introduce a mysterious and miraculous element into the Eliyyahu cycle.
I Kings 17:8,"<b>Tzarefat:</b> Pronounced <i>tzah-re-FAHT</i>. A town located a few miles south of Sidon, today in Lebanon."
I Kings 17:9,"<b>a palmful of meal:</b> A similar lack of food is noted in the Ugaritic epic of Kirta, as Mann remarks. In our story in general, the question concerns which god, Y<small>HWH</small> or Baal (who is featured in Ugaritic texts), will provide for the people. "
I Kings 17:10,<b>two:</b> Or “a few.”
I Kings 17:11,"<b>no breath was left in him:</b> The medieval commentators are split on the issue of whether the child is actually dead, but he certainly seems to be from the description. The wording is different from the Queen of Sheba’s “breathless” reaction in 10:5, above (there the word for “breath” is <i>ru’ah;</i> here, it is <i>neshama</i>)."
I Kings 17:12,<b>What have I to do with you:</b> Or “What do you have against me?” (Sweeney 2001). 
I Kings 17:13,"<b>to bring my iniquity to mind:</b> In popular ancient belief, focusing divine attention on an ordinary person was not necessarily good, but could be downright dangerous."
I Kings 17:14,<b>lodging:</b> A different form of the verb (Heb. g-w-r) usually rendered “sojourn.”
I Kings 17:15,"<b>measured himself:</b> A practice of putting a template, as it were, of a holy person over the sick one was thought to bring about a cure (a known ancient Near Eastern practice; see Gaster for examples in world folklore). "
I Kings 17:16,<b>life:</b> In the sense of “life force.”
I Kings 17:17,<b>life:</b> See note to v.21 above.
I Kings 18:1,<b>in the third year:</b> Perhaps of the drought.
I Kings 18:2,<b>Ovadyahu:</b> Pronounced <i>o-vahd-YAH-hoo;</i> trad. English “Obadiah.” 
I Kings 18:3,<b>Household:</b> Or “Palace-House.”
I Kings 18:4,"<b>Come, let us cross through:</b> As emended by Cogan (2001), who notes that the MT here (“Go through”) is ungainly, and so follows LXX. "
I Kings 18:5,"<b>cut off:</b> Ah’av worries about the animals, when Izevel has just “cut off” the prophets—a strong clue as to his priorities (Walsh), animals: Understood as domestic animals."
I Kings 18:6,<b>[It is]</b> I: Heb. simply has “I”; the repeated word has the effect of “yes” here (see Greenstein 199).
I Kings 18:7,"<b>Eliyyahu is here!:</b> This could also be understood, tellingly in the mouth of the faithful Ovadyahu, as “Here, Y<small>HWH</small> is my God!” (Walsh)."
I Kings 18:8,"<b>rushing-spirit:</b> Heb. <i>ru’ah</i> can mean both “spirit” and “wind,” so the concept is quite a physical one. Eliyyahu appears to move about quickly, “like the wind.”"
I Kings 18:9,"<b>Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High:</b> This title appears frequently in Samuel, and seems to suggest both the Lord of the heavenly bodies (or of the heavenly court) and the divine commander in chief of Israel’s armies."
I Kings 18:10,"<b>bringer-of-disaster:</b> Evoking the image of Akhan, whose greed after the fall of Jericho caused Israel’s initial defeat at Ai in Josh. 7. Note the threefold use of “disaster” there (vv.24-26)."
I Kings 18:11,<b>you have abandoned:</b> The Hebrew “you” is plural.
I Kings 18:12,<b>those eating at Izevel’s table:</b> And thus they are her royal dependents.
I Kings 18:13,"<b>hop on two branches:</b> As usual, the Bible presents its ideas in concrete imagery; thus the oft-seen translation, “halt between two opinions” (King James et al.), is not adequate. Another possibility for the verb is “hobble“; see Lev. :18, where the root means “lame.” Then the translation here might read “limp on two crutches.”"
I Kings 18:14,"<b>O Baal, answer us!:</b> A prayer of such brevity would have seemed rude to Hebrew-speaking audiences. Eliyyahu’s address beginning in v.36 is more formally correct."
I Kings 18:15,"<b>Maybe he is busy—maybe “doing his business”—:</b> Following some, Heb. <i>ki si’ah ki sig lo</i> is thus understood as scatological, and fits nicely with the rest of the taunt."
I Kings 18:16,"<b>after their practice:</b> Such cutting of the flesh is attested elsewhere in the ancient world, with a variety of meanings. Gaster connects it with fertility rites designed to revive a dying god, among other interpretations."
I Kings 18:17,"<b>ranted on:</b> As mentioned in the Commentary, this form of prophecy, sometimes called “mantic” or “ecstatic,” was known throughout antiquity (for instance, in the case of the Greek followers of Dionysus); see I Sam. 10, where it applies to Sha’ul. Forms of religious enthusiasm are, of course, still practiced in the modern world. "
I Kings 18:18,"<b>until the [time of the]… grain-gift:</b> Late afternoon, so a good many hours have passed. "
I Kings 18:19,"<b>no voice:</b> Heb. <i>kol</i> is also used as the conventional word for thunder (see the “voice of Y<small>HWH</small>” in Ps. ), and since Baal was worshipped as a storm/rain god, the wording here may be sarcastic (Fishbane)."
I Kings 18:20,"<b>mended:</b> Lit., “healed,” hence my use of “mended” rather than the more conventional “repaired.”"
I Kings 18:21,<b><i>sei’as:</i></b> The <i>sei’a</i> was a fairly large dry measure.
I Kings 18:22,"<b>Double it!:</b> That is, do it a second time."
I Kings 18:23,"<b>Eliyyahu the prophet:</b> The use of his full title, reinforcing his stature as the “real” prophet and setting up the drama that now follows."
I Kings 18:24,<b>fire of</b> Y<small>HWH</small>: Lightning; or an “incredible fire.”
I Kings 18:25,"<b>fell:</b> Elsewhere in such cases I use “flung themselves,” but Walsh points out the connection with the “fell” of the previous verse here. "
I Kings 18:26,"<b>Y<small>HWH</small>, he is God!:</b> The phrase has been taken over into Jews’ Yom Kippur prayers, moments before the end of the long day of fasting and prayer, when God is acknowledged as supreme."
I Kings 18:27,<b>slaughtered:</b> A word usually connected to animal sacrifice; see Gen. 22:10.
I Kings 18:28,"<b>Go up:</b> In contrast to his speech to the servant in v.43, where he uses “pray,” Eliyyahu is more “confrontative” with Ah’av (Walsh). "
I Kings 18:29,"<b>hark!:</b> Understanding Heb. <i>kol</i> here as in the Kayin and Hevel (Cain and Abel) story in Gen. 4:10, and elsewhere."
I Kings 18:30,<b>So Ah’av went up … :</b> He seems to have no reaction to the slaughtering of the Baalite priests! 
I Kings 18:31,<b>crouched … and put his face between his knees:</b> In concentration (Montgomery).
I Kings 18:32,"<b>seven times:</b> As we have encountered it previously, this is a folkloric number, usually indicating perfection."
I Kings 18:33,"<b>ran ahead of Ah’av:</b> Medieval commentators, and Cogan (2001), see this as a mark of respect for the king, with Eliyyahu acting like one of the outrunners. But it should also be noted that from Carmel to Yizre’el is a hefty run, perhaps eighteen miles. So Eliyyahu outraces the king’s chariot horses, again acting almost supernaturally (Cantrell)."
I Kings 19:1,"<b>and above all:</b> Following ancient versions; MT has “and all that,” which makes no sense."
I Kings 19:2,<b>He was afraid:</b> Ancient versions and manuscripts; MT has “he saw.” 
I Kings 19:3,<b>Be’er-Sheva that belongs to Judah:</b> Some two hundred miles from Eliyyahu’s usual haunts in the north.
I Kings 19:4,"<b>a broom tree:</b> Others, “a single/lone broom tree,” but Heb. <i>ahat</i> may simply be the indefinite article in northern biblical speech. As for the tree, commentators differ over whether this is a different bush than the one above, or some kind of textual error."
I Kings 19:5,"<b>messenger:</b> From God; our “angel’’ is derived from Greek <i>angelos</i>, “messenger.” "
I Kings 19:6,<b>touching:</b> Perhaps even with the nuance of “punching” (Mann) or “poking.”
I Kings 19:7,<b>too much:</b> Or “more than enough” (Walsh).
I Kings 19:8,"<b>a cave:</b> The definite article in biblical Hebrew can often be understood as indefinite in English. Nevertheless, some take it as <i>the</i> cave of revelation to Moshe (see the “cleft of the rock” in Exod. 33:22)."
I Kings 19:9,"<b>Y<small>HWH</small> was not in the … :</b> The unusual form here seems to break out of narrative and belong almost to the realm of incantation, or at least oral performance, making the scene even more vivid. Before each phrase, virtually all translations insert “but,” which, however, is not in the text."
I Kings 19:10,"<b>a still, small voice:</b> Heb. <i>kol demama dakka.</i> Levine suggests a usage of <i>d-m-m</i> that describes mourning or the like, and Simon (1997) notes a similar meaning in ancient versions; I therefore contemplated using “a mild murmuring voice.” But the King James Version’s “a still, small voice” has never been surpassed, and retains much of the mystery and ambiguity of the Hebrew, in which the prophetic experience encompasses both awestruck silence and speech. The genius of the King James translators is also on display here, since what they inherited from their great predecessor, WilliamTyndale (whose translation informs the bulk of their text), was “a small, still voice.”"
I Kings 19:11,<b>way:</b> Translated as “journey” in v.7. 
I Kings 19:12,"<b>the Wilderness of Damascus:</b> East of Lake Tiberias, and a region well-known as a place of refuge (Gray 1970). "
I Kings 19:13,"<b>anoint Hazael:</b> This action will actually be done by Eliyyahu’s disciple Elisha, so Eliyyahu will accomplish it only indirectly (Fishbane)."
I Kings 19:14,<b>Elisha:</b> Pronounced <i>eh-lee-SHAH.</i> The name means “My God Delivers.” 
I Kings 19:15,"<b>Evel-Mehola:</b> Southeast of Bet-She’an, near the Jordan River. "
I Kings 19:16,"<b>anoint:</b> In the case of Elisha, some commentators see the act as indicating “appointing,” and not literally pouring oil on his head."
I Kings 19:17,"<b>Yehu:</b> He is not to be confused with the prophet Yehu, whom we encountered in 16:1."
I Kings 19:18,"<b>twelve:</b> Undoubtedly representing the idealized, united twelve tribes of Israel. "
I Kings 19:19,<b>threw his mantle over him:</b> The mantle or cloak was a symbol of selfhood and authority; see David’s cutting off of the edge of Sha’ul’s mantle in I Sam. 24:5.
I Kings 19:20,<b>what have I done to you?:</b> The tone and force of Eliyyahu’s question are unclear. It sounds like a rebuke.
I Kings 19:21,"<b>slaughtered … boiled … ate:</b> The meal has the aura of a ritual of parting and is, in fact, a dramatic moment in Elisha’s life."
I Kings 20:1,
I Kings 20:2,
I Kings 20:3,
I Kings 20:4,
I Kings 20:5,
I Kings 20:6,<b>your eyes:</b> Some versions read “their eyes.”
I Kings 20:7,<b>know and take-note:</b> Following Cogan’s (2001) suggestion; Heb. <i>u-d’u u-r’u.</i> 
I Kings 20:8,<b>sent:</b> Or even “demanded” (Long).
I Kings 20:9,<b>dust:</b> Or “rubble.” 
I Kings 20:10,"<b>suffices for handfuls:</b> According to Kimhi, the army will be so large that the dust of the destroyed Shomeron will not even fill up their hands."
I Kings 20:11,"<b>Speak on:</b> The time for politeness has passed (Walsh, Long). "
I Kings 20:12,"<b>let not the one who buckles on … : A</b> military metaphor about dressing in armor, perhaps the equivalent of “Don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched” (Walsh). "
I Kings 20:13,"<b>strips off:</b> Equivalent to “unbuckles,” after the battle."
I Kings 20:14,"<b>Sukkot:</b> Used as a base of operations east of the Jordan, but some read simply as “in booths.” "
I Kings 20:15,<b>Set [the attack]!:</b> Following Cogan (2001).
I Kings 20:16,"<b>squire-lads:</b> Not as heavily armed as the regular troops, and so less easy to detect (Gray 1970). "
I Kings 20:17,<b>bind up the battle-array:</b> The verb is usually used regarding horses and chariots. It has parallels in Akkadian (Cogan 2001).
I Kings 20:18,"<b>Children of Israel:</b> Heb. <i>benei yisrael</i>, which LXX understands as <i>benei hayil</i>, “valiant ones.” "
I Kings 20:19,"<b>seven thousand:</b> Here and elsewhere in the verse, versions differ on the numbers (here the LXX reads “sixty thousand”)."
I Kings 20:20,<b>helping:</b> or “allied with” (Walsh).
I Kings 20:21,"<b>they sent [to] Ben-Hadad:</b> MT has, confusingly, “he sent Ben-Hadad.”"
I Kings 20:22,<b>alive seize them [too]:</b> An incoherent answer which betrays Ben-Hadad’s drunken state (Walsh).
I Kings 20:23,<b>the prophet:</b> Mentioned in v.13. 
I Kings 20:24,<b>the turn of the year:</b> Probably in late spring.
I Kings 20:25,"<b>A god of the hills:</b> Alternatively, “mountain gods” (Cogan 2001)."
I Kings 20:26,<b>governors:</b> A loan word from Assyrian.
I Kings 20:27,<b>fell away from:</b> Deserted.
I Kings 20:28,"<b>Afek:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-FAKE.</i> The name of several towns in the Bible. Gray (1970) understands this particular reference as a place east of Lake Tiberias, on the road to Damascus."
I Kings 20:29,"<b>bare:</b> Hebrew unclear; ancient versions read as “little.” Clearly, a sense of vulnerability is central."
I Kings 20:30,"<b>so that you may know that I am Y<small>HWH</small>!:</b> Echoing a common theme in the Exodus, Conquest traditions, and the book of Ezekiel."
I Kings 20:31,"<b>a room within a room:</b> “Deeper and deeper into the maze of buildings” (Walsh), or even “a closet” (Mann)."
I Kings 20:32,"<b>kings [who keep] loyalty:</b> Not “merciful,” as in some translations. The point is that these kings keep their agreements (“covenants”). "
I Kings 20:33,<b>cords:</b> Koehler/Baumgartner see these as “a sign of surrender”; a kind of leash is attested in Assyrian depictions of prisoners. 
I Kings 20:34,<b>your life:</b> MT; ancient versions have “our lives.”
I Kings 20:35,"<b>brother:</b> In the sense of an equal, a treaty partner."
I Kings 20:36,<b>practicing divination:</b> Or looking for an omen (Cogan 2001). 
I Kings 20:37,<b>seized upon it:</b> Following Cogan. 
I Kings 20:38,<b>Ben-Hadad is your brother!:</b> They seem to be surprised.
I Kings 20:39,"<b>He said:</b> That is, Ben-Hadad. "
I Kings 20:40,"<b>bazaars:</b> That is, streets, with the specific connotation of market stalls. "
I Kings 20:41,"<b>while I:</b> Apparently, Ah’av is now the speaker."
I Kings 20:42,"<b>Sons of the Prophets:</b> Members of prophetic guilds, not loners, as Eliyyahu seems to be."
I Kings 20:43,<b>covering:</b> Or “bandage” (Gray 1970).
I Kings 20:44,"<b>a talent of silver:</b> Gray (1970) notes that this is a hundred times the price of a slave in Exod. 21:32, and therefore a huge amount of money. It may be an indication that, at least in this case, prisoners of war were given over to the sanctuary."
I Kings 20:45,<b>judgment:</b> Or “sentence.”
I Kings 20:46,"<b>Because you sent free …:</b> The king is condemned here for sparing his enemy, which violated certain biblical views on warfare. In this, he is paralleled to Sha’ul (King Saul), who lost his throne over this issue in I Sam. 15. "
I Kings 20:47,"<b>devoted-to-destruction:</b> Others, “under the ban,” reserved for Y<small>HWH</small>."
I Kings 21:1,<b>Navot:</b> Pronounced <i>nah-VOTE;</i> trad. English “Naboth.” It may mean “shoot” (of a plant). The Bible frequently compares human mortality to the transitory nature of plant growth. 
I Kings 21:2,<b>Great-House:</b> Palace.
I Kings 21:3,"<b>Give me:</b> Here, as in some other biblical passages, the verb has the connotation of “sell.” "
I Kings 21:4,"<b>my house:</b> Likewise, the palace."
I Kings 21:5,"<b>turned away his face:</b> In II Kings 20:2, Hizkiyyahu (Hezekiah) is similarly described, indicating that he is ready to die (Walsh)."
I Kings 21:6,"<b>I will not give you my vineyard!:</b> Not surprisingly, Ah’av omits Navot’s emphasis on “the inheritance of my fathers.”"
I Kings 21:7,"<b>Do <i>you</i>, now, exercise kingship over Israel?:</b> JPS reads, “Now is the time to show yourself king,” but the Hebrew seems to imply a more sarcastic tone."
I Kings 21:8,"<b>freemen:</b> A different root than the one used as “free” in v.21. Others, “nobles.”"
