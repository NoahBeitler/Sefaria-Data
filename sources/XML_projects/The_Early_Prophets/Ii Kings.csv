Ii Kings 1:1,And Moav rebelled against Israel after the death of Ah’av.
Ii Kings 1:2,"Now Ahazya fell through the lattice of his upper-chamber that was in Shomeron,
and he became sick [from his injuries].
So he sent messengers, and said to them:
Go, inquire of Baal Zevuv/Master of Flies, the god of Ekron,
whether I will live through this sickness!"
Ii Kings 1:3,"Now a messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Eliyya the Tishbite:
Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Shomeron,
and speak to them:
Is it because there is no God in Israel
[that all of] you go to inquire of Baal Zevuv, the god of Ekron?"
Ii Kings 1:4,"So therefore, thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
The bed into which you climbed up,
you will not come down from it,
but you will die, yes, die!
And Eliyya went off."
Ii Kings 1:5,"The messengers returned to him, and he said to them:
Now why have you returned?"
Ii Kings 1:6,"They said to him:
A man came up to meet us,
and he said to us:
Go, return to the king who sent you,
and speak to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Is it because there is no God in Israel
[that] you send to inquire of Baal Zevuv, the god of Ekron?
Therefore,
the bed into which you climbed up,
you will not come down from it,
but you will die, yes, die!"
Ii Kings 1:7,"He spoke to them:
What is the manner of the man who came up to meet you
and spoke these words to you?"
Ii Kings 1:8,"They said to him:
A hairy man,
with a girded-belt of leather girded about his loins.
He said:
It is Eliyya the Tishbite!"
Ii Kings 1:9,"So he sent to him a captain of fifty, with his [unit of] fifty.
He went up to him,
and here, he was sitting on top of a hill;
and he spoke to him:
O man of God, the king has spoken:
Come down!"
Ii Kings 1:10,"Eliyyahu answered
and spoke to the captain of fifty:
Now if I am a man of God,
let fire come down from the heavens
and consume you and your fifty!
And fire came down from the heavens
and consumed him and his fifty."
Ii Kings 1:11,"He sent again to him—another captain of fifty and his fifty;
he went up and spoke to him:
O man of God,
thus says the king:
Come down quickly!"
Ii Kings 1:12,"Eliyya answered and spoke to them:
If I am a man of God,
let fire come down from the heavens
and consume you and your fifty!
And fire of God came down from the heavens
and consumed him and his fifty."
Ii Kings 1:13,"He sent again—a third captain of fifty and his fifty;
he went up and came, the third captain of fifty,
but he bowed on his knees in front of Eliyyahu
and pleaded with him
and spoke to him:
O man of God, now may my life and the life of these your fifty servants be precious in your eyes!"
Ii Kings 1:14,"[For] here, fire came down from the heavens
and consumed the previous captains of fifty and their fifties;
but now, may my life be precious in your eyes!"
Ii Kings 1:15,"Then a messenger of God spoke to Eliyyahu:
Go down with him; do not be afraid before him.
So he arose and went down with him to the king."
Ii Kings 1:16,"And he spoke to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zevuv, the God of Ekron,
—Is it because there is no God in Israel whose word can be inquired of?—
therefore,
the bed into which you climbed up,
you will not come down from it,
but you will die, yes, die!"
Ii Kings 1:17,"And he died, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that Eliyyahu had spoken,
and Yehoram reigned as king in his place,
in year two of Yehoram son of Yehoshafat, king of Judah,
for he had no son."
Ii Kings 1:18,"Now the rest of the events of Ahazyahu, [and] what he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
Ii Kings 2:1,"Now it was,
when Y<small>HWH</small> was about to bring up Eliyyahu in a storm to the heavens,
that Eliyyahu went with Elisha from Gilgal."
Ii Kings 2:2,"And Eliyyahu said to Elisha:
Pray stay here,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has sent me as far as Bet-El.
Elisha said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your own life, if I should leave you … !
So they went down to Bet-El."
Ii Kings 2:3,"And the Sons of the Prophets who were in Bet-El came out to Elisha
and said to him:
Do you know
that today Y<small>HWH</small> is going to take your lord from your head?
He said:
Certainly I know; be silent!"
Ii Kings 2:4,"Eliyyahu said to him:
Elisha, pray stay here,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has sent me to Jericho.
But he said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your own life, if I should leave you … !
So they came to Jericho."
Ii Kings 2:5,"And the Sons of the Prophets who were in Jericho came close to Elisha
and said to him:
Do you know
that today Y<small>HWH</small> is going to take your lord from your head?
He said:
Certainly I know; be silent!"
Ii Kings 2:6,"Then Eliyyahu said to him:
Pray stay here,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has sent me to the Jordan.
But he said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your own life, if I should leave you … !
Thus the two of them walked on."
Ii Kings 2:7,"Now fifty men of the Sons of the Prophets went
and stood opposite, at a distance,
while the two of them stood by the Jordan."
Ii Kings 2:8,"And Eliyyahu took his mantle, folded it up, and struck the waters,
and they split in half, to here and to there,
and the two of them crossed over on dry-ground."
Ii Kings 2:9,"It was when they crossed that Eliyyahu said to Elisha:
Make-request: what may I do for you before I am taken from beside you?
Elisha said:
Pray let a twofold measure of your spirit be upon me!"
Ii Kings 2:10,"He said:
You have made a difficult request.
If you see me being taken from you, it will be thus for you,
but if not, it will not be."
Ii Kings 2:11,"And it was, as they were walking, walking along and speaking,
that here, a chariot of fire and horses of fire:
they parted the two of them,
and Eliyyahu went up in the storm to the heavens."
Ii Kings 2:12,"When Elisha saw [it],
he kept crying out: Father! Father!
Israel’s chariotry and its horsemen!
But he saw him no more.
So he took hold of his garments and tore them into two torn-pieces,"
Ii Kings 2:13,"and picked up the mantle of Eliyyahu that had fallen from him;
then he returned and stood at the bank of the Jordan."
Ii Kings 2:14,"And he took the mantle of Eliyyahu that had fallen from him
and struck the waters,
and said:
Where is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Eliyyahu, indeed?
He struck the waters
and they split in half, to here and to there,
and Elisha crossed over."
Ii Kings 2:15,"And the Sons of the Prophets who were in Jericho saw him opposite;
they said:
The spirit of Eliyyahu has come to rest upon Elisha!
They came to meet him and bowed low before him to the ground,"
Ii Kings 2:16,"and they said to him:
Now here, there are fifty men among your servants, valiant ones;
pray let them go and seek your lord,
lest the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> has carried him off
and has thrown him onto one of the mountains or into one of the valleys!
But he said:
You are not to send!"
Ii Kings 2:17,"But they pressed him until he was ashamed,
so he said: Send.
They sent fifty men
and searched for three days,
but they did not find him."
Ii Kings 2:18,"They returned to him
—he was staying in Jericho—
and he said to them:
Did I not say to you: Do not go?"
Ii Kings 2:19,"The men of the town said to Elisha:
Now here, the site of the town is good, as my lord can see,
but the water is bad, and the land causes miscarrying!"
Ii Kings 2:20,"He said:
Fetch me a new bowl and put salt there.
They fetched [it] for him."
Ii Kings 2:21,"He went out to the outflow of the waters
and threw salt in it,
and he said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
I have healed these waters;
there will no longer be death and miscarrying from there!"
Ii Kings 2:22,"And the waters were healed, until this very day,
in accordance with the word of Elisha which he had spoken."
Ii Kings 2:23,"He went up from there to Bet-El.
And as he was going up on the road, some young lads went up out of the town;
they jeered at him and said to him:
Go up, baldhead! Go up, baldhead!"
Ii Kings 2:24,"He faced about behind him and saw them
and cursed them in the name of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and two she-bears came out of the forest
and ripped up forty-two youngsters from them."
Ii Kings 2:25,"He went from there to Mount Carmel,
and from there he returned to Shomeron."
Ii Kings 3:1,"Now Yehoram son of Ah’av became king over Israel in Shomeron
in year eighteen of Yehoshafat king of Judah;
he reigned as king for twelve years."
Ii Kings 3:2,"And he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
although not like his father or like his mother:
he removed the standing-stone of Baal that his father had made"
Ii Kings 3:3,"—although he clung to the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin,
and did not turn aside from them."
Ii Kings 3:4,"Now Mesha king of Moav was a sheep-dealer;
he would supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand he-lambs and a hundred thousand rams in wool."
Ii Kings 3:5,"But it was, at the death of Ah’av,
that the king of Moav rebelled against the king of Israel."
Ii Kings 3:6,"And King Yehoram went out on that very day from Shomeron
and counted all Israel [for war];"
Ii Kings 3:7,"he went and sent to Yehoshafat king of Judah, saying:
The king of Moav has rebelled against me.
Will you go with me to Moav in battle?
He said:
I will go up!
[For] I am as you are:
my people as your people,
my horses as your horses!"
Ii Kings 3:8,"He said:
By which road shall we go up?
He said:
The Road of the Wilderness of Edom."
Ii Kings 3:9,"So they went, the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom;
they [traveled] round about the road for seven days.
Now there was no water for the camp or for the animals that were behind them,"
Ii Kings 3:10,"so the king of Israel said:
Alas,
for Y<small>HWH</small> must have called these three kings together
to give them into the hand of Moav!"
Ii Kings 3:11,"Yehoshafat said:
Is there no prophet of Y<small>HWH</small> here
that we may inquire of Y<small>HWH</small> through him?
One of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said:
Here is Elisha son of Shafat,
who poured water over the hands of Eliyyahu."
Ii Kings 3:12,"Yehoshafat said:
With him is the word of Y<small>HWH</small>!
And so they went down to him,
the king of Israel, and Yehoshafat, and the king of Edom."
Ii Kings 3:13,"Elisha said to the king of Israel:
What have I to do with you?
Go to your father’s prophets and to your mother’s prophets!
The king of Israel said to him:
No—
for Y<small>HWH</small> has called these three kings together
to give them into the hand of Moav!"
Ii Kings 3:14,"Elisha said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, in whose presence I stand,
indeed: were it not that I hold up the face of Yehoshafat king of Judah [in respect],
I would not look at you, I would not see you!"
Ii Kings 3:15,"So-now, fetch me a [lyre] strummer!
For it was, when the strummer strummed,
that the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> would [come] upon him—"
Ii Kings 3:16,"and he said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
This wadi will produce ditches upon ditches,"
Ii Kings 3:17,"for thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
You will not see wind, you will not see showers,
yet that wadi will be filled with water,
and you and your cattle and your animals will drink!"
Ii Kings 3:18,"And this is [but] a light matter in Y<small>HWH</small>’s eyes;
he will give Moav into your hand."
Ii Kings 3:19,"You will strike every fortified town and every choice town,
every good tree you will fell,
and every spring of water you will stop up,
and every good plot-of-land you will mar with stones!"
Ii Kings 3:20,"It was at daybreak, at about the [time of] offering up the grain-gift,
that here, water was coming from the direction of Edom,
and the land filled up with water."
Ii Kings 3:21,"Now all Moav had heard
that the kings were coming up to do battle against them,
and they were summoned,
from all those belting on a sword-belt and upward,
and they stood at the border."
Ii Kings 3:22,"They started early in the morning,
when the sun rose over the water,
and Moav saw, from a distance, water red as blood."
Ii Kings 3:23,"So they said:
This is blood!—
the kings have been put-to-the-sword, yes, the sword,
each one has struck down his fellow!
So-now, to the spoils, O Moav!"
Ii Kings 3:24,"They came to the camp of Israel,
but Israel arose and struck Moav, so that they fled before them;
they came against it, to strike down Moav:"
Ii Kings 3:25,"the towns they wrecked,
and into every good plot-of-land each one threw his stone, and filled it up,
while every source of water they stopped up
and every good tree they felled,
until [only] its stones in Kir-Hareset were left—
but the slingers surrounded [it] and struck it down."
Ii Kings 3:26,"And the king of Moav saw that the battle was too strong for him,
so he took with him seven hundred men drawing the sword,
to break through to the king of Edom,
but they could not prevail."
Ii Kings 3:27,"So he took his firstborn son, who was to become king in his place,
and offered him up as an offering-up on the wall.
And a great wrath was upon Israel,
so that they had to march away from him and return to the land."
Ii Kings 4:1,"Now a woman from the wives of the Sons of the Prophets cried out to Elisha, saying:
Your servant, my husband, is dead.
You yourself know
that your servant held Y<small>HWH</small> in awe.
But a creditor has come to take away my two children as slaves for himself!"
Ii Kings 4:2,"Elisha said to her:
What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?
She said:
Your handmaid has nothing at all in the house
except for a cruse of oil."
Ii Kings 4:3,"He said:
Go, borrow vessels for yourself from outside, from all your neighbors, empty vessels
—do not skimp—"
Ii Kings 4:4,"and come in, close the door behind you and behind your children,
and pour [oil] into all these vessels,
while the full ones set aside."
Ii Kings 4:5,"So she went from him and closed the door behind her and behind her sons;
as they were bringing them to her, she kept on pouring."
Ii Kings 4:6,"And it was, when the vessels were filled up, that she said to her son:
Bring me another vessel.
He said:
There is no other vessel!
And the oil stopped."
Ii Kings 4:7,"Then she came and told the man of God.
He said:
Go, sell the oil
and pay off your debt;
you and your children will live on the rest."
Ii Kings 4:8,"Now it was, one day, that Elisha traveled to Shunem.
There was a prominent woman there,
and she urged him strongly to eat food [with her].
So it would be, whenever he traveled by, he would turn aside there to eat food."
Ii Kings 4:9,"She said to her husband:
Now here, you know
that he is a holy man of God,
passing by us regularly."
Ii Kings 4:10,"Now let us make him a little walled upper-chamber
and let us put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp there for him,
so that it may be, whenever he comes to us, he may turn aside there."
Ii Kings 4:11,"And it was one day that he came there,
and he turned aside to the upper-chamber and lay down there."
Ii Kings 4:12,"He said to Gehazi his serving-lad:
Call this Shunammite!
He called her, and she stood before him."
Ii Kings 4:13,"He said to him:
Now say to her:
Here, you have taken the trouble for us, all this trouble;
what can be done for you?
Might you be spoken about to the king, or to the commander of the armed-forces?
She said:
Among my own kinspeople I reside."
Ii Kings 4:14,"He said:
So what can be done for her?
Gehazi said:
Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."
Ii Kings 4:15,"He said:
Call her.
And he called her, and she stood in the entrance."
Ii Kings 4:16,"Then he said:
At this set season, when time revives,
you will embrace a son!
She said:
Do not, my lord, O man of God,
do not lie to your handmaid!"
Ii Kings 4:17,"But the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son,
at that set season, when time revived,
as Elisha had spoken to her."
Ii Kings 4:18,"And the boy grew.
Now it was one day, that he went out to his father, to the reapers,"
Ii Kings 4:19,"and he said to his father: My head, my head!
He said to a serving-lad:
Carry him to his mother!"
Ii Kings 4:20,"So he carried him and brought him to his mother;
he sat on her knees until noon,
and then he died."
Ii Kings 4:21,"She went up and lay him down upon the bed of the man of God,
closed [the door] on him, and went out."
Ii Kings 4:22,"Then she called to her husband and said:
Now send me one of the lads and one of the she-asses,
that I may run out to the man of God and then return."
Ii Kings 4:23,"He said:
For-what-reason must you be going to him today?
It is not New-Moon, it is not the Sabbath.
She said:
[All] is well."
Ii Kings 4:24,"But she saddled the she-ass and said to her serving-lad:
Lead and go,
do not stop me from riding unless I say [so] to you."
Ii Kings 4:25,"So she went
and came to the man of God, to Mount Carmel.
It was, when the man of God saw her at a distance,
that he said to Gehazi his serving-lad:
Here is that Shunammite."
Ii Kings 4:26,"So-now, pray run to meet her and say to her:
Is it well with you?
Is it well with your husband?
Is it well with the child?
She said: It is well."
Ii Kings 4:27,"She came to the man of God, to the mountain,
and she took hold of him by the feet;
Gehazi approached to push her away,
but the man of God said:
Leave her be, for her feelings are bitter within her,
yet Y<small>HWH</small> has concealed it from me and has not told me."
Ii Kings 4:28,"She said:
Did I request a son from my lord?
Did I not say: Do not set me [too much] at ease?"
Ii Kings 4:29,"He said to Gehazi:
Gird up your loins,
take my rod in your hand, and go.
If you encounter a man, you are not to bless him [in greeting];
you are to answer no man,
and if any man blesses you [in greeting],
you are not to answer him.
But put my rod on the face of the lad."
Ii Kings 4:30,"The mother of the lad said:
As Y<small>HWH</small> lives and as you live, if I should leave you … !
He arose and went after her."
Ii Kings 4:31,"Meanwhile Gehazi crossed over ahead of them and put the rod on the face of the lad,
but there was no sound and no attention,
so she returned to meet him and said to him, saying:
The lad did not wake up!"
Ii Kings 4:32,"Elisha came into the house,
and here, the lad was dead, lying on his bed."
Ii Kings 4:33,"He came in and closed the door behind the two of them
and prayed to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Ii Kings 4:34,"then he climbed up and lay down atop the child;
he put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his palms on his palms,
and bent over him,
and the flesh of the child became warm."
Ii Kings 4:35,"He turned away and went through the house, once here and once there,
then he climbed up and bent over him;
the lad sneezed seven times
and the lad opened his eyes!"
Ii Kings 4:36,"He called Gehazi and said:
Call this Shunammite!
He called her and she came to him,
and he said:
Lift up your son!"
Ii Kings 4:37,"She came and flung herself at his feet, and bowed low to the ground;
then she lifted up her son and went out."
Ii Kings 4:38,"When Elisha returned to Gilgal,
there was famine in the land.
Now the Sons of the Prophets were sitting before him.
And he said to his serving-lad:
Set on the large pot,
and cook stew for the Sons of the Prophets."
Ii Kings 4:39,"One [of them] went out into the field to gather herbs,
and he came across a field vine
and gathered field gourds from it, [enough] to fill his garment.
Then he came back and split them into the pot of stew,
for he did not know [what they were]."
Ii Kings 4:40,"Now they were poured out for the men to eat,
but it was, just as they ate them from the stew,
that they cried out and said:
There is death in the pot, O man of God!
and they could not eat it."
Ii Kings 4:41,"He said:
Then fetch some meal! …
And he threw it into the pot
and said:
Pour some for the people, so that they may eat!
And then there was nothing evil in the pot."
Ii Kings 4:42,"A man came from Baal Shalisha;
he brought to the man of God bread of the firstfruits:
twenty bread-loaves of barley and ears of fresh grain.
And he said:
Give some to the people, that they may eat!"
Ii Kings 4:43,"His attendant said:
How can I give this before a hundred persons?
He said:
Give some to the people, so that they may eat!
For thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
They will eat and have some left over."
Ii Kings 4:44,"So he gave it before them and they ate, and they had some left over, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 5:1,"Now Naaman, commander of the armed-forces of the king of Aram, was a man prominent before his lord, one lifted up of face,
for through him, Y<small>HWH</small> had given victory to Aram.
But the man, [though] a mighty-one of valor, was stricken-with-<i>tzaraat</i>."
Ii Kings 5:2,"Once Aram had gone out in raiding-bands,
and they had taken a young girl captive from the land of Israel;
she was [in service] before Naaman’s wife."
Ii Kings 5:3,"She said to her mistress:
Would that my lord were [standing] before the prophet who is in Shomeron—
then he would cure him of his <i>tzaraat</i>!"
Ii Kings 5:4,"He came back and told his lord, saying:
Like this and like that spoke the girl who is from the land of Israel."
Ii Kings 5:5,"The king of Aram said:
Go, come [then]—I will send a letter to the king of Israel.
He went and took in his hand ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten sets of garments,"
Ii Kings 5:6,"and he brought the letter to the king of Israel [which] said:
So-now, when this letter reaches you,
here, I am sending you Naaman my servant,
so that you may cure him of his <i>tzaraat</i>."
Ii Kings 5:7,"But it was, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his garments
and said:
Am I God, to deal death and bestow life,
that this one sends [a message] to me to cure a man of his <i>tzaraat?</i>
Indeed, just know and take-note
of how he is seeking a pretext against me!"
Ii Kings 5:8,"Now it was, when Elisha the man of God heard
that the king of Israel had torn his garments,
he sent to the king of Israel, saying:
Why have you torn your garments?
Just have him come to me,
that he may know
that there is a prophet in Israel!"
Ii Kings 5:9,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot,
and stood at the entrance to the house belonging to Elisha."
Ii Kings 5:10,"And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying:
Go and wash seven times in the Jordan;
then your flesh will be restored to you, and you will be purified."
Ii Kings 5:11,"But Naaman became furious and went away;
he said:
Here, I had said to myself:
He will come out, yes, out, and stand [there] to call on the name of Y<small>HWH</small> his god,
then he will raise his hand over the diseased-spot, and take away the <i>tzaraat</i>."
Ii Kings 5:12,"Are not the Amana and the Parpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?
Could I not wash in them and be purified?
He turned and went away in hot-anger."
Ii Kings 5:13,"But his servants approached and spoke to him, they said:
If it were a hard thing that the prophet spoke to you, would you not do it?
How much more so, when he said to you: Wash and be purified!"
Ii Kings 5:14,"So he went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, in accordance with the word of the man of God,
and his flesh was returned-to-health like a young lad’s flesh,
and he was purified."
Ii Kings 5:15,"Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his camp,
and he came and stood before him and said:
Now here, I know
that there is no god in all the earth except in Israel!
So-now, pray accept a blessing-gift from your servant!"
Ii Kings 5:16,"He said:
As Y<small>HWH</small> lives, before whom I stand,
if I should accept [anything] … !
Now he pressed him to take [it], but he refused."
Ii Kings 5:17,"So Naaman said:
If not, let there be given to your servant
a mule team’s load of earth—
for never again will your servant prepare an offering-up or a sacrifice to other gods,
except to Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Kings 5:18,"In this [one] matter, may Y<small>HWH</small> pardon your servant:
when my lord comes to the House of Rimmon, to bow down there,
and he leans on my arm, so that I bow down in the House of Rimmon—
when I bow down in the House of Rimmon,
may Y<small>HWH</small> pardon your servant in this matter!"
Ii Kings 5:19,"He said to him:
Go in peace.
And he went from him, a stretch of land [in distance]."
Ii Kings 5:20,"And Gehazi, the serving-lad of Elisha the man of God, said [to himself]:
Here, my lord spared this Naaman the Aramean by [not] accepting what he brought from his hand;
by the life of Y<small>HWH</small>, I will surely run after him and accept something from him!"
Ii Kings 5:21,"So Gehazi pursued Naaman;
when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him,
and said:
Is [all] well?"
Ii Kings 5:22,"He said:
[All] is well.
My lord sent me, saying:
Here, now two lads from the highlands of Efrayim, from the Sons of the Prophets, just came to me.
Pray give them a talent of silver and two sets of garments."
Ii Kings 5:23,"Naaman said:
Consent [to] accept two talents!
He pressed him, and he wrapped up two talents of silver in two purses, with two sets of garments,
and gave them to his two lads,
and they carried them ahead of him."
Ii Kings 5:24,"He came to the Ofel/The Bulge,
and he took them from their hand, and deposited them in the house.
Then he sent the men off, and they went away,"
Ii Kings 5:25,"while he himself came and stood opposite his lord.
Elisha said to him:
From where, Gehazi?
He said:
Your servant has gone neither here nor there."
Ii Kings 5:26,"He said to him:
Did not my heart go along, when a man reversed [course] from his chariot to meet you?
[Is this] the time to take silver, to take garments, or olive-groves or vineyards, or flocks or herds, or servants or handmaids?"
Ii Kings 5:27,"So Naaman’s <i>tzaraat</i>—it will cleave to you and to your seed, for the ages!
And he went out from before him, afflicted with <i>tzaraat</i> like snow."
Ii Kings 6:1,"[Once] the Sons of the Prophets said to Elisha:
Now here, the place where we are residing before you is too narrow for us."
Ii Kings 6:2,"Pray let us go to the Jordan, and let each one take a log from there, and let us construct ourselves there a place to reside.
He said: Go."
Ii Kings 6:3,"One [of them] said:
Pray consent to go with your servants!
Elisha said:
I will go."
Ii Kings 6:4,"So he went with them, and they came to the Jordan,
where they felled some trees."
Ii Kings 6:5,"And it was, as one was felling a log, that the iron [ax head] fell into the water;
he cried out and said: Alas, my lord, for it was borrowed!"
Ii Kings 6:6,"The man of God said: Where did it fall?
He showed him the place.
Then he carved out some wood and threw it in there, and it made the iron float,"
Ii Kings 6:7,"and he said: Pick it up for yourself.
So he stretched out his hand and took it."
Ii Kings 6:8,"Now the king of Aram was waging battle against Israel.
He sought advice from his servants, saying:
Descend on thus and such a place [to attack]!"
Ii Kings 6:9,"But the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying:
Be careful when crossing by this place,
for there Aram descends [to attack],"
Ii Kings 6:10,"The king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God had spoken to him and warned him, so that he took care there,
not [only] once and not [only] twice."
Ii Kings 6:11,"And the king of Aram’s heart was in turmoil over this matter,
so he called his servants and said to them:
Will you not tell me:
who from among us is for the king of Israel?"
Ii Kings 6:12,"One of his servants said to him:
No, my lord king;
but Elisha the prophet, who is in Israel,
tells the king of Israel
the words that you speak in your [very] bedroom!"
Ii Kings 6:13,"He said:
Go and see where he is,
and I will send and fetch him!
It was told to him, saying:
Here, in Dotan."
Ii Kings 6:14,"So he sent there horses and chariots, a weighty army;
they came at night and encircled the town."
Ii Kings 6:15,"And the attendant of the man of God started-early to rise and went out,
and here, an army was surrounding the town, with horse and chariotry!
His serving-lad said to him:
Alas, my lord, what shall we do?"
Ii Kings 6:16,"He said:
Do not be afraid,
for many more are those who are with us than who are with them."
Ii Kings 6:17,"Now Elisha prayed and said:
O Y<small>HWH</small>, now open his eyes, that he may see!
So Y<small>HWH</small> opened the eyes of the lad, and he saw:
now here, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire surrounding Elisha!"
Ii Kings 6:18,"They went down against him, but Elisha prayed to Y<small>HWH</small> and said:
Now strike this nation with dazzling-light!
And he struck them with dazzling-light, in accordance with the word of Elisha."
Ii Kings 6:19,"Elisha said to them:
This is not the way and this is not the town!
Go along after me, and I will lead you to the man whom you seek.
And he led them to Shomeron."
Ii Kings 6:20,"It was, when they came to Shomeron,
that Elisha said: O Y<small>HWH</small>,
open the eyes of these [people], that they may see!
So Y<small>HWH</small> opened their eyes, and they saw:
now here, [they were] in the midst of Shomeron!"
Ii Kings 6:21,"The king of Israel said to Elisha when he saw them:
Shall I strike, strike them down, Father?"
Ii Kings 6:22,"He said:
You are not to strike.
Those whom you have taken captive with your sword, with your bow,
would you strike [them] down?
Put food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go back to their lords."
Ii Kings 6:23,"And he spread out for them a great spread,
so that they ate and drank;
then he sent them off, and they went back to their lords.
And the raiding-bands of Aram no longer came into the land of Israel."
Ii Kings 6:24,"Now it was, [some time] after this,
that Ben-Hadad king of Aram collected all his camp;
he went up and besieged Shomeron."
Ii Kings 6:25,"And there was a great famine in Shomeron;
here, they were besieging it
until [the price of] a donkey’s head was eighty silver-pieces,
and a quarter of a <i>kav</i> of “pigeons’ dung,” five silver-pieces."
Ii Kings 6:26,"Now it was that the king of Israel was crossing on the wall when a woman cried out to him, saying:
Save [me], my lord king!"
Ii Kings 6:27,"He said:
No; let Y<small>HWH</small> save you—
from where can I save you?
From the threshing-floor or from the winepress?"
Ii Kings 6:28,"And the king said to her:
What [ails] you?
She said:
This woman said to me:
Give over your son, that we may eat him today,
and my son we will eat tomorrow!"
Ii Kings 6:29,"So we boiled my son, and ate him;
then I said to her on the next day:
Give over your son, that we may eat him
—but she hid her son."
Ii Kings 6:30,"Now it was, when the king heard the woman’s words,
that he tore his garments;
and as he was crossing by the wall,
the people saw that here, the sackcloth was on his flesh, on the inside."
Ii Kings 6:31,"He said:
Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add,
if the head of Elisha son of Shafat is left standing upon him today!"
Ii Kings 6:32,"Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him,
and he had sent a man from his presence;
but before the messenger came to him, he had said to the elders:
Do you see that this son of a murderer has sent to remove my head?
See, when the messenger comes, close the door and press him against the door;
is not the sound of his lord’s footsteps behind him?"
Ii Kings 6:33,"He was still speaking with them
when here, the king came down to him
and said:
Here now, this evil-fate is from Y<small>HWH</small>;
what more hope in Y<small>HWH</small> can I have?"
Ii Kings 7:1,"Then Elisha said:
Hear the word of Y<small>HWH</small>:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
Around this time tomorrow,
a <i>sei’a</i> of flour [will go] for a <i>shekel</i>
and two <i>sei’as</i> of barley for a <i>shekel</i>, at the gate of Shomeron."
Ii Kings 7:2,"Then the officer upon whose arm the king leans spoke up to the man of God
and said:
Here, were Y<small>HWH</small> to make hatches in the sky,
could this thing happen?
He said:
Here, you will it see with your eyes,
but from there you shall not eat!"
Ii Kings 7:3,"Now there were four men with <i>tzaraat</i>, at the entrance to the [town] gate.
They said, each one to his neighbor:
Why are we sitting here until we die?"
Ii Kings 7:4,"If we say, Let us go into the town,
there is a famine in the town,
and we will die there,
and if we sit here, we will die.
So-now, let us go and fall away to the camp of Aram—
if they let us live, then we will live,
and if they put us to death, then we will die."
Ii Kings 7:5,"So they arose at twilight-breeze, to enter the camp of Aram.
They had entered the edge of camp of Aram,
and here, there was no one there!"
Ii Kings 7:6,"—For Y<small>HWH</small> had made the camp of Aram hear
the sound of chariots, the sound of horses,
the sound of a great army,
so that each one said to his brother:
Here, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt, to come against us!"
Ii Kings 7:7,"So they arose and fled at twilight-breeze,
and abandoned their tents and their horses and their donkeys,
[with] the camp as it was,
and they fled for their lives.—"
Ii Kings 7:8,"And those with <i>tzaraat</i> came to the edge of the camp,
and they entered a tent, and ate and drank,
and carried off from there silver and gold and garments,
and went away and hid them;
then they returned and entered another tent,
and carried off [things] from there
and went away and hid them."
Ii Kings 7:9,"Then they said, each one to his neighbor:
It is not proper, what we are doing;
this day—it is a day of [good] news,
and we are keeping silent!
If we wait until the light of daybreak,
iniquity will find us!
So-now, let us go, let us enter, and let us inform the king’s house."
Ii Kings 7:10,"So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the town
and told them, saying:
We entered the camp of Aram,
and here, no one was there, or even a human voice,
but the horses were tied up and the donkeys were tied up,
[with] the tents as they were."
Ii Kings 7:11,"The gatekeepers called out and informed the king’s house within,"
Ii Kings 7:12,"and the king arose at night and said to his servants:
Now let me inform you what Aram has done to us:
they knew that we were famished,
so they went out of the camp to hide in the open-field, saying:
When they have gone out of the town,
we will seize them alive, and the town we will enter!"
Ii Kings 7:13,"Then one of his servants spoke up and said:
Now let them take five of the remaining horses, the ones that remain in it;
here, they are like the whole throng of Israel that remain in it,
here, they are like the whole throng of Israel that is done for.
Let us send them and let us see!"
Ii Kings 7:14,"So they picked two chariots of horses,
and the king sent them after the camp of Aram, saying:
Go and see."
Ii Kings 7:15,"They went after them, as far as the Jordan,
and here, the whole road was filled with garments and vessels
which Aram had thrown away in their fearful-haste.
The messenger returned and told the king."
Ii Kings 7:16,"And the people went out and despoiled the camp of Aram;
and it was that a <i>sei’a</i> of flour [went for] a <i>shekel</i>, and two <i>sei’as</i> of barley for a <i>shekel</i>, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 7:17,"Now the king had appointed the officer upon whose arm he leans to the town gate,
and the people trampled him at the gate, so that he died,
as the man of God had spoken,
as he had spoken when the king had come down to him."
Ii Kings 7:18,"For it was when the man of God had spoken to the king, saying:
Two <i>sei’as</i> of barley [will go] for a <i>shekel</i>, and a <i>sei’a</i> of flour for a <i>shekel</i> will go at around this time tomorrow at the gate of Shomeron—"
Ii Kings 7:19,"that the officer had answered the man of God and said:
Now here, were Y<small>HWH</small> to make hatches in the sky,
could this thing happen?
And he had said:
Here, you will see it with your eyes,
but from there you shall not eat!"
Ii Kings 7:20,"And thus it happened to him:
the people trampled him at the gate, and he died."
Ii Kings 8:1,"Now Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying:
Arise and go, you and your household,
and sojourn where you wish to sojourn,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has proclaimed a famine
—indeed, it has come upon the land—for seven years."
Ii Kings 8:2,"So the woman arose and did in accordance with the word of the man of God;
she went, she and her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines, for seven years."
Ii Kings 8:3,"It was at the end of the seven years
that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines,
and she went out to cry out to the king about her house and about her fields."
Ii Kings 8:4,"Now the king had been speaking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying:
Pray recount to me all the great things that Elisha has done."
Ii Kings 8:5,"And it was, as he was recounting to the king how he had restored the dead one to life,
that here, the very woman whose son he had restored to life was crying out to the king about her house and about her fields.
So Gehazi said:
My lord king,
this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life!"
Ii Kings 8:6,"The king inquired of the woman, and she recounted it to him;
so the king gave her over to an official, saying:
Return everything that is hers, along with all the revenue from the fields,
from the time that she left the land until now."
Ii Kings 8:7,"Elisha came to Damascus
when Ben-Hadad, king of Aram, was sick,
and it was told to him, saying:
The man of God has come here."
Ii Kings 8:8,"The king said to Hazael:
Take a gift in your hand
and go to meet the man of God.
Inquire of God through him, saying:
Will I live through this sickness?"
Ii Kings 8:9,"Hazael went to meet him,
he took a gift in his hand—namely, all the best-goods of Damascus, forty camel loads,
and he came and stood before him, and said:
Your son, Ben-Hadad king of Aram, has sent me to you, saying:
Will I live through this sickness?"
Ii Kings 8:10,"Elisha said to him:
Go, say to him:
You will live, yes, live—
but Y<small>HWH</small> has shown me that he will die, yes, die."
Ii Kings 8:11,"He kept his face still, setting it [thus] until he was ashamed,
and then the man of God wept."
Ii Kings 8:12,"Hazael said:
Why does my lord weep?
He said:
Because I know what you will do to the Children of Israel—evil:
their fortified places you will set on fire,
their young men you will kill with the sword,
their babies you will dash-to-pieces,
and their pregnant women you will split open!"
Ii Kings 8:13,"And Hazael said:
Indeed, what is your servant, a [mere] dog,
that he could do such a great thing?
Elisha said:
Y<small>HWH</small> has shown you to me as king over Aram."
Ii Kings 8:14,"He went out from Elisha and came back to his lord,
and he said to him:
What did Elisha say to you?
He said:
He said to me:
You will live, yes, live."
Ii Kings 8:15,"But it was on the morrow
that he took meshed-cloth and dipped it in water;
he spread it over his face, and he died.
And Hazael reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 8:16,"In year five of Yoram son of Ah’av king of Israel—Yehoshafat was king of Judah—
Yehoram son of Yehoshafat king of Judah became king."
Ii Kings 8:17,"Thirty-two years old was he at his becoming king,
and for eight years he reigned as king in Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 8:18,"He walked in the way of the kings of Israel,
as the House of Ah’av had done,
for the daughter of Ah’av was a wife for him;
and he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 8:19,"But Y<small>HWH</small> was not willing to bring ruin upon Judah
for the sake of David his servant,
as he had said to him,
to give him a lamp for his children, for all the days [to come]."
Ii Kings 8:20,"In his days Edom rebelled from under the hand of Judah,
and they kinged themselves a king."
Ii Kings 8:21,"So Yoram crossed over to Tza’ir, and all the chariotry with him;
it was that he set out in the night
and struck Edom, who was surrounding him and the chariot commanders,
and the fighting-people fled to their tents."
Ii Kings 8:22,"And Edom has been rebelling from under the hand of Judah,
until this day.
Then Livna [too] rebelled at that time."
Ii Kings 8:23,"Now the rest of the events of Yoram, and all that he did,
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 8:24,"Yoram lay beside his fathers;
he was buried with his fathers in the City of David,
and Ahazyahu his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 8:25,"In year twelve of the years of Yoram son of Ah’av king of Israel,
Ahazyahu son of Yehoram king of Judah became king."
Ii Kings 8:26,"Twenty-two years old was Ahazyahu at his becoming king,
and for one year he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Atalyahu [grand]daughter of Omri king of Israel."
Ii Kings 8:27,"He walked in the way of the House of Ah’av:
he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, like the House of Ah’av,
for he was a son-in-law of the House of Ah’av."
Ii Kings 8:28,"He went out with Yoram son of Ah’av to do battle with Hazael king of Aram, at Ramot-Gil’ad,
and the Arameans struck Yoram."
Ii Kings 8:29,"And Yoram the king returned to be healed in Yizre’el
from the wounds that the Arameans had struck him at Rama
when he engaged in battle with Hazael king of Aram.
And Ahazyahu son of Yehoram king of Judah went down
to see Yoram son of Ah’av in Yizre’el,
for he was sick [from his wounds]."
Ii Kings 9:1,"Now Elisha the prophet called one of the Sons of the Prophets
and said to him:
Gird up your loins,
take this flask of oil in your hand,
and go to Ramot-Gil’ad."
Ii Kings 9:2,"When you come there, look there for Yehu son of Yehoshafat son of Nimshi;
when you come, you are to take him up from the midst of his brothers
and are to bring him into a room within a room."
Ii Kings 9:3,"Then you are to take the flask of oil and you are to pour it on his head
and say: Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
I am anointing you as king over Israel!
Then you are to open the door and are to flee; you are not to wait."
Ii Kings 9:4,"So the lad, the prophet lad, went to Ramot-Gil’ad."
Ii Kings 9:5,"He came there, and here, the commanders of the army were sitting around;
he said:
I have a message for you, O Commander!
Yehu said:
For whom of all of us?
He said:
For you, O Commander."
Ii Kings 9:6,"He arose and entered the house,
then he poured the oil on his head
and said to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
I anoint you as king over the people of Y<small>HWH</small>, over Israel!"
Ii Kings 9:7,"You are to strike down the House of Ah’av, your lord,
that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets
and the blood of all the servants of Y<small>HWH</small> at the hand of Izevel."
Ii Kings 9:8,"All the House of Ah’av will perish;
I will cut off from Ah’av he who pisses against the wall,
[even] the fettered and forsaken in Israel!"
Ii Kings 9:9,"And I will make the House of Ah’av like the House of Yorov’am son of Nevat,
and like the House of Ba’sha son of Ahiyya."
Ii Kings 9:10,"And Izevel the dogs will eat in the plot of Yizre’el,
with no one to bury [her]!
Then he opened the door and fled."
Ii Kings 9:11,"Now Yehu went out to the servants of his lord;
they said to him:
Is [all] well?
For-what-reason did this madman come to you?
He said to them:
<i>You</i> know the man and his talk!"
Ii Kings 9:12,"They said:
A lie!
Now tell us!
He said:
Like this and like that he said to me, saying:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
I anoint you as king over Israel!"
Ii Kings 9:13,"Quickly each one took his garment
and put it under him, on the steps themselves;
then they sounded a blast on the <i>shofar</i>
and said:
Yehu reigns as king!"
Ii Kings 9:14,"So Yehu son of Yehoshafat son of Nimshi bound himself [in conspiracy] against Yoram
—now Yoram had been protecting Ramot-Gil’ad, he and all Israel, from Hazael king of Aram."
Ii Kings 9:15,"But King Yehoram had returned to be healed at Yizre’el from the wounds with which the Arameans had wounded him,
when he had engaged in battle with Hazael king of Aram.—
Yehu said:
If this be your desire,
do not let any escaped-one out of the town, to go tell in Yizre’el!"
Ii Kings 9:16,"And Yehu mounted up and went to Yizre’el,
for Yoram was laid up there,
while Ahazya king of Judah had gone down to see Yoram."
Ii Kings 9:17,"Now the lookout was standing on the tower in Yezre’el;
he saw Yehu’s horde as he was coming,
and said:
I see a horde!
Yehoram said:
Take a rider and send him to meet them, that he may say: Is [all] well?"
Ii Kings 9:18,"The horse rider went to meet him and said:
Thus says the king: Is [all] well?
Yehu said:
What is it to you if [all] is well?
Turn in behind me!
So the lookout reported, saying:
The messenger coming to them does not return."
Ii Kings 9:19,"So he sent a second horse rider,
and he came to them and said:
Thus says the king: [Is all] well?
Yehu said:
What is it to you if [all] is well?
Turn in behind me!"
Ii Kings 9:20,"So the lookout reported, saying:
He came to them but does not return.
Now his driving is like the driving of Yehu son of Nimshi—
for he drives like-a-madman!"
Ii Kings 9:21,"Then Yehoram said:
Harness up!
They harnessed his chariot,
and Yehoram king of Israel went out, with Ahazyahu king of Judah, each one in his chariot;
they went to meet Yehu,
and they encountered him in the plot of Navot the Yizre’elite."
Ii Kings 9:22,"And it was, when Yehoram saw Yehu,
that he said:
Is [all] well, Yehu?
He said:
What is “well,” as long as the many whorings of Izevel your mother and her sorceries [continue]?"
Ii Kings 9:23,"Yehoram reversed his hands and fled,
and said to Ahazyahu: Treason, Ahazya!"
Ii Kings 9:24,"But Yehu filled his hand with the bow
and struck Yehoram between his shoulder-blades,
so that the arrow stuck out of his heart,
and he collapsed in his chariot."
Ii Kings 9:25,"Then he said to Bidkar his officer:
Pick [him] up! Throw him
into the plot of field of Navot the Yizre’elite,
for keep in mind—I and you were riding, each with a team, behind Ah’av his father,
when Y<small>HWH</small> pronounced this pronouncement upon him:"
Ii Kings 9:26,"Did I not see the blood of Navot and the blood of his sons yesterday?
—the Utterance of Y<small>HWH</small>;
so I will pay you back in this very plot
—the Utterance of Y<small>HWH</small>.
So-now, pick [him] up, throw him into the plot, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Kings 9:27,"Now when Ahazyahu king of Judah saw [it], he fled by the road to Bet-Ha-Gan,
and Yehu pursued after him and said:
Him too—strike him down!
… in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is near Yivle’am.
He fled to Megiddo, and died there."
Ii Kings 9:28,"His servants drove him to Jerusalem,
and they buried him in his burial-place, beside his fathers,
in the City of David."
Ii Kings 9:29,"In year eleven of the years of Yoram son of Ah’av, Ahazya became king over Judah."
Ii Kings 9:30,"And Yehu came to Yizre’el;
when Izevel heard,
she put kohl on her eyes and prettied her hair
and looked out through the window."
Ii Kings 9:31,"When Yehu came to the gate, she said:
Is [all] well, [you] Zimri, killer of his lord?"
Ii Kings 9:32,"He lifted up his face toward the window
and said:
Who is with me? Who?
And two [or] three officials looked out at him."
Ii Kings 9:33,"He said:
Hurl her down! And they hurled her down;
some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses,
and he trampled her."
Ii Kings 9:34,"Then he came in, and ate and drank,
and he said:
Take care of this doomed one, and bury her,
for she is the daughter of a king."
Ii Kings 9:35,"But when they went to bury her, they could not find [anything] of her
except for the skull, the feet, and the palms of the hands."
Ii Kings 9:36,"They returned and told him,
and he said:
It is the word of Y<small>HWH</small>
that he spoke by the hand of his servant Eliyyahu the Tishbite, saying:
In the plot of Yizre’el
the dogs will eat the flesh of Izevel!"
Ii Kings 9:37,"And the corpse of Izevel will be like dung on the surface of the ground, in the plot of Yizre’el,
so that they will not [be able to] say: This is Izevel!"
Ii Kings 10:1,"Now Ah’av had seventy sons in Shomeron.
And Yehu wrote letters and sent [them] to Shomeron,
to the commanders of Yizre’el, the elders,
and to those raising Ah’av’s [sons], saying:"
Ii Kings 10:2,"So-now, when this letter comes to you,
—since with you are your lord’s sons,
and since with you are the chariotry and the horses,
and the fortified city and the weapons—"
Ii Kings 10:3,"select the best and the brightest one of your lord’s sons
and put him on the throne of his father,
and do battle for the house of your lords!"
Ii Kings 10:4,"They became exceedingly afraid, exceedingly, and said:
Here, two kings could not stand against him,
so how will we stand, we ourselves?"
Ii Kings 10:5,"[The One] Over the House, and [The One] Over the City, and the elders, and the child-rearers, sent to Yehu, saying:
We are your servants!
Now whatever you say to us, we will do!
We will not make anyone king;
what is best in your eyes, do!"
Ii Kings 10:6,"He wrote to them a second letter, saying:
If you are for me,
and to my voice you would hearken,
then fetch the heads of the men, your lord’s sons,
and bring them to me around this time tomorrow, to Yizre’el.
Now the king’s sons, seventy men,
were with the great-ones of the city, the ones rearing them."
Ii Kings 10:7,"And it was, when the letter came to them,
that they took the king’s sons
and slaughtered them, seventy men,
and put their heads in baskets;
then they sent them to him in Yizre’el."
Ii Kings 10:8,"A messenger came and told him, saying:
They have brought the heads of the king’s sons!
He said:
Put them in two piles at the entrance to the city-gate until daybreak."
Ii Kings 10:9,"Now it was at daybreak that he went out and stood
and said to all the people:
You are innocent.
—Here, I conspired against my master, and I killed him,
but who struck down all of these?"
Ii Kings 10:10,"Know, therefore,
that no word of Y<small>HWH</small> will fall to the ground
that Y<small>HWH</small> promised concerning the House of Ah’av;
Y<small>HWH</small> has done
what he promised through the hand of his servant Eliyyahu."
Ii Kings 10:11,"Then Yehu struck down all who remained of the House of Ah’av in Yizre’el,
along with all his great-ones, his intimates, and his priests,
until he had left him no survivor."
Ii Kings 10:12,"Then he arose and came, that he might go to Shomeron.
He was at a binding house for shepherds on the way,"
Ii Kings 10:13,"when Yehu came upon brothers of Ahazyahu king of Judah.
He said:
Who are you?
They said:
We are brothers of Ahazyahu;
we have come down [to see] the welfare of the sons of the king and the sons of the queen [mother]."
Ii Kings 10:14,"He said:
Seize them alive!
They seized them alive
and slaughtered them at the cistern of the binding-house,
forty-two men;
he did not leave out one of them."
Ii Kings 10:15,"He went from there and came upon Yehonadav son of Rekhav [coming] to meet him;
he blessed him [in greeting] and said to him:
Is your heart straight-and-true, as my heart is with your heart?
Yehonadav said:
It is, yes, it is!
[He said]:
Give me your hand!
He gave him his hand, and he pulled him up to him in the chariot."
Ii Kings 10:16,"He said:
Go with me, and see my zeal for Y<small>HWH</small>!
And he had him ride in his chariot."
Ii Kings 10:17,"He came to Shomeron
and struck down all who were left to Ah’av in Shomeron, until he had wiped it out,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had spoken to Eliyyahu."
Ii Kings 10:18,"Then Yehu collected all the people
and said to them:
Ah’av served Baal a little;
Yehu will serve him much!"
Ii Kings 10:19,"So-now, all the prophets of Baal, all those serving him and all his priests, call together to me—
let no man be unaccounted for,
for I have a great sacrifice for Baal;
anyone who is unaccounted for shall not live!
—Now Yehu was acting with cunning,
in order to annihilate those serving Baal.—"
Ii Kings 10:20,"Yehu said:
Hallow an <i>atzara</i>-festival for Baal!
And they proclaimed it."
Ii Kings 10:21,"And Yehu sent throughout all Israel,
and all those serving Baal came—
there was not left one who did not come;
they came to the House of Baal, and filled the House of Baal from end to end."
Ii Kings 10:22,"Then he said to [The One] Over the Wardrobe:
Bring out apparel for all those serving Baal!
and he brought them out apparel."
Ii Kings 10:23,"And Yehu and Yehonadav son of Rekhav came into the House of Baal,
and he said to those serving Baal:
Search out and see, lest there be with you some of the servants of Y<small>HWH</small>,
rather than those serving Baal alone!"
Ii Kings 10:24,"They came in to perform sacrifices and offerings-up;
meanwhile, Yehu had placed eighty men for himself outside
and had said:
The man who lets [anyone] escape from the men whom I am bringing into your hand—
<i>his</i> life in place of his life!"
Ii Kings 10:25,"So it was, when he was finished performing the offering-up,
that Yehu said to the outrunners and to the officers:
Come in, strike them down! Let no one get away!
So they struck them down with the mouth of the sword,
and the outrunners and the officers [left them] thrown [there],
and went on to the rear-chamber of the House of Baal."
Ii Kings 10:26,"They took out the standing-pillar of the House of Baal,
and then they burned it."
Ii Kings 10:27,"And they demolished the standing-pillar of Baal,
and they demolished the House of Baal
and made it into a latrine, until today"
Ii Kings 10:28,Thus Yehu wiped out Baal from Israel.
Ii Kings 10:29,"—However, as for the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, which he had caused Israel to sin,
Yehu did not turn aside from [following] after them,
the golden calves that were at Bet-El, and that were at Dan."
Ii Kings 10:30,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehu:
Because you have acted well, doing what is right in my eyes,
—according to all that was in my heart, you have done to the House of Ah’av—
sons of four [generations] from you shall sit on the throne of Israel."
Ii Kings 10:31,"Yet Yehu did not take care to walk according to the Instruction of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, with all his heart;
he did not turn aside from the sins of Yorov’am, who had caused Israel to sin."
Ii Kings 10:32,"In those days, Y<small>HWH</small> began to truncate Israel:
Hazael struck them throughout the entire territory of Israel,"
Ii Kings 10:33,"from the Jordan toward the rising of the sun,
all the land of Gil’ad: the Gadite, the Re’uvenite, and the Menashite,
from Aro’er which is by Wadi Arnon, including the Gil’ad and the Bashan."
Ii Kings 10:34,"Now the rest of the events of Yehu, and all that he did, and all his mighty-deeds—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
Ii Kings 10:35,"Yehu lay beside his fathers;
they buried him in Shomeron,
and Yehoahaz his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 10:36,"Now the days that Yehu had reigned as king over Israel
were twenty-eight years in Shomeron."
Ii Kings 11:1,"Now when Atalya, Ahazyahu’s mother, saw that her son was dead,
she set out to annihilate all the seed of the kingdom."
Ii Kings 11:2,"But Yehosheva daughter of King Yoram, sister of Ahazyahu, took Yoash son of Ahazya
and stole him from the midst of the king’s sons who were being put to death
—him and his nurse—in the bedchamber,
and they hid him from Atalyahu, so that he was not put to death."
Ii Kings 11:3,"And he was with her in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, in hiding, for six years,
while Atalyahu was reigning over the land."
Ii Kings 11:4,"But in the seventh year, Yehoyada sent and took the commanders of hundreds of the Carites, and of the outrunners,
and brought them to him in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
he cut them a covenant and had them swear [fealty] in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and showed them the king’s son."
Ii Kings 11:5,"And he charged them, saying:
This is the thing that you are to do:
a third of you coming [on your watch] for the Sabbath,
those who guard the guarding of the king’s house,"
Ii Kings 11:6,"and a third at the Sur Gate,
and a third at the gate behind the Outrunners’ [Gate]—
you are to guard the guarding of the House. …"
Ii Kings 11:7,"The [other] two units among you,
all those going off-duty for the Sabbath,
are to guard the guarding of Y<small>HWH</small>’s house, over the king."
Ii Kings 11:8,"You are to encircle the king, all around, each one with his weapons in his hand,
so that whoever comes through to the rows is to be put to death.
And be with the king in his going out and in his coming in!"
Ii Kings 11:9,"So the commanders of hundreds did exactly as Yehoyada the priest had charged:
they took, each one, his fighting-men,
those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off-duty on the Sabbath,
and came to Yehoyada the priest."
Ii Kings 11:10,"And the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spear-arsenal and the bow cases that had belonged to King David
that were in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Ii Kings 11:11,"and the outrunners took a stand, each one with his weapons in his hand,
from the right shoulder of the House to the left shoulder, at the sacrificial-altar and at the House, all around the king."
Ii Kings 11:12,"Then he brought out the king’s son
and placed on him the diadem and the insignia;
they made him king—they anointed him,
and they struck their hands together and said:
May the king live!"
Ii Kings 11:13,"Atalya heard the sound of the outrunners [and] of the fighting-people,
so she came to the People in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 11:14,"And she saw: here, the king was standing by the standing-column, as was the custom,
with the commanders and their trumpets by the king,
and all the Landed People were rejoicing and sounding a blast on the trumpets.
Then Atalyahu tore her garments and called out: Conspiracy! Conspiracy!"
Ii Kings 11:15,"And Yehoyada the priest charged the commanders of hundreds, those accountable for the army,
and said to them:
Bring her out within the rows,
and anyone who comes after her, put to death with the sword!
For the priest said [to himself]:
Let her not be put to death in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Kings 11:16,"So they laid hands on her
and she came in by way of the Horses’ Entrance to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and was put to death there."
Ii Kings 11:17,"Then Yehoyada cut a covenant between Y<small>HWH</small> and the king and the people,
to be Y<small>HWH</small>’s people,
and [one] between the king and the people."
Ii Kings 11:18,"And all the Landed People came to the House of Baal and demolished it:
its sacrificial-altars and its images they smashed to bits,
and Mattan, the priest of Baal, they killed in front of the altars.
Then the priest set accountable men over the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Ii Kings 11:19,"and he took the commanders of hundreds and the Carites and the outrunners and all the Landed People,
and they brought the king down from the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
they entered by way of the Outrunners’ Gate, into the House of the King,
and he took his seat on the kings’ throne."
Ii Kings 11:20,"And all the Landed People rejoiced, and the city was quiet,
while Atalyahu they put to death with the sword in the House of the King."
Ii Kings 12:1,Seven years old was Yehoash when he became king.
Ii Kings 12:2,"In year seven of Yehu, Yehoash became king,
and for forty years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Tzivya, from Be’er-Sheva."
Ii Kings 12:3,"And Yehoash did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, all his days,
as Yehoyada the priest had instructed him."
Ii Kings 12:4,"However, the sanctuaries were not removed;
the people were still offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke at the sanctuaries."
Ii Kings 12:5,"Yehoash said to the priests:
All the silver for holy-purposes that is brought to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
silver of one’s counting [in the census],
—silver of the valuation of persons,
[or] any silver that goes up in a man’s heart to bring to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>—"
Ii Kings 12:6,"let the priests take it for themselves, each one from his acquaintance,
and they themselves shall strengthen the breaches in the House,
wherever a breach is found there."
Ii Kings 12:7,"But it was in year twenty-three, that year of King Yehoash:
the priests had not strengthened the breaches in the House."
Ii Kings 12:8,"So King Yehoash called for Yehoyada the priest and for the [other] priests
and said to them:
Why are you not strengthening the breaches in the House?
Now,
do not keep silver from your acquaintances,
but rather for the breaches in the House you are to give it over."
Ii Kings 12:9,"The priests agreed not to take silver from the people,
and not to strengthen the breaches in the House."
Ii Kings 12:10,"Then Yehoyada the priest took a coffer
and bored a hole in its lid,
and gave it near the sacrificial-altar,
on the right as one entered the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
the priests, the guardians of the threshold, would give there
all the silver that was brought to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 12:11,"So it was, whenever they saw that there was much silver in the coffer,
that the king’s scribe and the Great Priest would go up,
they would tie up and count the silver that was found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 12:12,"Then they would give the silver that was measured out into the hands of those doing the work, those accountable in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and they would pay it out to the carvers of wood and to the builders who were doing [tasks] in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Ii Kings 12:13,"and to the wall-builders and to the stone-cutters,
for purchasing wood and quarried stones
to strenghen the breaches in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and for everything [else] that was paid out for the House, to strengthen it."
Ii Kings 12:14,"But there would not be made for the House of Y<small>HWH</small>
silver basins, snuffers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets,
any kind of vessels of gold or vessels of silver,
from the silver that was brought to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;"
Ii Kings 12:15,"rather, to those doing the work they would give it,
so that with it they would strengthen the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 12:16,"And they did not have to reckon [exactly] with the men into whose hand they gave the silver,
to give [payment] to those doing the work,
for in trustworthy-fashion they dealt."
Ii Kings 12:17,"Silver from <i>asham</i>-offerings and silver from <i>hattat</i>-offerings was not brought into the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
it was for the priests."
Ii Kings 12:18,"Then Hazael king of Aram went up and waged battle against Gat, and took it,
and [afterward] Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 12:19,"So Yehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Yehoshafat, Yehoram, and Ahazyahu, his fathers, the kings of Judah, had hallowed,
and his own hallowed things,
and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and in the House of the king,
and sent [them] to Hazael king of Aram,
so that he went up away from Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 12:20,"Now the rest of the events of Yoash, and all that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 12:21,"His servants arose and conspired a conspiracy;
they struck Yoash down at Bet-Millo, which leads down to Silla."
Ii Kings 12:22,"Now it was Yozakhar son of Shim’at and Yehozavad son of Shomer his servants who struck him down, so that he died;
they buried him beside his fathers, in the City of David,
and Amatzya his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 13:1,"In year twenty-seven of the years of Yoash son of Ahazyahu king of Judah,
Yehoahaz son of Yehu became king in Shomeron,
for seventeen years."
Ii Kings 13:2,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
he walked after the sin of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin;
he did not turn aside from it."
Ii Kings 13:3,"So Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against Israel,
and he gave them into the hand of Hazael king of Aram
and into the hand of Ben-Hadad son of Hazael, for all the days."
Ii Kings 13:4,"But Yehoahaz soothed the face of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and Y<small>HWH</small> hearkened to him,
for he saw the oppression of Israel,
for the king of Aram had oppressed them."
Ii Kings 13:5,"So Y<small>HWH</small> granted Israel a deliverer, so that they came out from under the hand of Aram,
and the Children of Israel could sit in their tents, as yesterday [and] the day-before."
Ii Kings 13:6,"However, they did not turn aside from the sins of the House of Yorov’am, who had caused Israel to sin—
in them they walked;
even an Ashera-pole stood in Shomeron."
Ii Kings 13:7,"For no fighting-people were left to Yehoahaz
except for fifty riders, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot-soldiers,
for the king of Aram had annihilated them;
he had made them like dust for trampling."
Ii Kings 13:8,"Now the rest of the events of Yehoahaz, and all that he did, and all his mighty-deeds—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
Ii Kings 13:9,"Yehoahaz lay beside his fathers;
they buried him in Shomeron,
and Yoash his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 13:10,"In year thirty-seven of the years of Yoash king of Judah,
Yehoash son of Yehoahaz became king of Israel in Shomeron,
for sixteen years."
Ii Kings 13:11,"And he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
he did not turn aside from all the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin;
in them he walked."
Ii Kings 13:12,"Now the rest of the events of Yoash, and all that he did, and his mighty-deeds when he did battle with Amatzya king of Judah—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
Ii Kings 13:13,"Yoash lay beside his fathers,
and Yorov’am sat on his throne,
and Yoash was buried in Shomeron, beside the kings of Israel."
Ii Kings 13:14,"Now Elisha fell sick with the sickness from which he was to die.
Yoash king of Israel went down to him
and wept upon his face, he said:
Father! Father! Israel’s chariotry and its horsemen!"
Ii Kings 13:15,"Elisha said to him:
Take a bow and some arrows.
So he took him a bow and some arrows."
Ii Kings 13:16,"He said to the king of Israel:
Have your hand mount the bow.
He had his hand mount it.
Then Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands,"
Ii Kings 13:17,"and said:
Open the east-facing window.
And he opened it.
Then Elisha said:
Shoot.
And he shot.
He said:
An arrow of victory for Y<small>HWH</small>, and an arrow of victory over Aram;
you will strike down Aram at Afek, until [they are] finished off!"
Ii Kings 13:18,"And he said:
Take the arrows.
So he took them.
Then he said to the king of Israel:
Strike the ground.
So he struck three times, and then stopped."
Ii Kings 13:19,"The man of God became furious with him and said:
Striking five or six times—
then you would have struck down Aram until [they would have been] finished off!
But now
you will strike Aram [only] three times."
Ii Kings 13:20,"Elisha died, and they buried him.
Now raiding-bands from Moav would come into the land at the coming of the year."
Ii Kings 13:21,"And [once] it was, they were burying a man,
and here, they saw such a band,
so they threw the man into the burial-place of Elisha and went off.
And [when] the man touched the bones of Elisha, he lived [again],
and he arose and stood on his feet."
Ii Kings 13:22,Now Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel all the days of Yehoahaz.
Ii Kings 13:23,"But Y<small>HWH</small> was gracious to them
and had compassion on them
and turned his face toward them
for the sake of his covenant with Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov;
he was not willing to bring them to ruin
and has not cast them out from his presence until now."
Ii Kings 13:24,"Hazael king of Aram died,
and Ben-Hadad his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 13:25,"And Yehoash son of Yehoahaz once again took the towns from the hand of Ben-Hadad son of Hazael
which he had taken from the hand of Yehoahaz his father, in battle:
three times Yehoash struck them,
and recovered the towns of Israel."
Ii Kings 14:1,"In year two of Yoash son of Yehoahaz king of Israel,
Amatzyahu son of Yoash became king of Judah."
Ii Kings 14:2,"Twenty-five years old was he on his becoming king,
and for twenty-nine years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Yehoaddan, from Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 14:3,"He did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>—
however, not like David his father;
exactly as Yoash his father had done, he did."
Ii Kings 14:4,"However, the sanctuaries were not removed;
the people still were offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke at the sanctuaries."
Ii Kings 14:5,"Now it was
when the kingdom was strong in his hand,
that he struck down [those of] his servants who had struck down the king his father."
Ii Kings 14:6,"But the sons of those who had struck [him] down he did not put to death,
as is written in the Record of the Instruction of Moshe which Y<small>HWH</small> commanded, saying:
Fathers are not to be put to death for sons, and sons are not to be put to death for fathers;
rather, each for his own sin is to be put to death!"
Ii Kings 14:7,"It was he who struck down Edom in the Valley of Salt, ten thousand,
and took the Boulder in battle;
he called its name Yokte’el, until this day."
Ii Kings 14:8,"Then Amatzya sent messengers to Yehoash son of Yehoahaz son of Yehu king of Israel, saying:
Come, let us see each other’s face [in battle]!"
Ii Kings 14:9,"Yehoash king of Israel sent [word] to Amatzyahu king of Judah, saying:
The briar that is in the Levanon sent [word] to the cedar that is in the Levanon, saying:
Give your daughter to my son as a wife!
But a beast of the open-field that is in the Levanon crossed by and trampled the briar."
Ii Kings 14:10,"You struck, yes, struck down Edom,
but your heart lifts you up [in arrogance]!
Keep your glory and stay at home!
Why should you stir up evil for yourself
and fall, you and Judah with you?"
Ii Kings 14:11,"But Amatzyahu would not hearken,
so Yehoash king of Israel went up, and they saw one another’s faces [in battle], he and Amatzyahu king of Judah,
at Bet-Shemesh that belongs to Judah."
Ii Kings 14:12,"And Judah was defeated before Israel,
and they fled, each to his tent."
Ii Kings 14:13,"And Amatzyahu king of Judah, son of Yehoash son of Ahazyahu, Yehoash king of Israel seized at Bet-Shemesh;
then he came to Jerusalem and breached the wall of Jerusalem,
from the Efrayim Gate to the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits,"
Ii Kings 14:14,"and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels that were found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and in the treasuries of the king’s house, along with hostages.
Then he returned to Shomeron."
Ii Kings 14:15,"Now the rest of the events of Yehoash, [and] what he did, and his mighty-deeds, and how he engaged in battle with Amatzyahu king of Judah—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
Ii Kings 14:16,"Yehoash lay beside his fathers;
he was buried at Shomeron, beside the kings of Israel,
and Yorov’am his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 14:17,And Amatzyahu son of Yehoash king of Judah lived after the death of Yehoash king of Israel for fifteen years.
Ii Kings 14:18,"Now the rest of the events of Amatzyahu—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 14:19,"They conspired a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lakhish;
they sent [men] after him to Lakhish, and they put him to death there."
Ii Kings 14:20,"Then they carried him back on horses,
and he was buried in Jerusalem, beside his fathers, in the City of David."
Ii Kings 14:21,"And all the people of Judah took Azarya
—he was sixteen years old—
and made him king in place of his father Amatzyahu."
Ii Kings 14:22,"It was he who rebuilt Elat and restored it to Judah,
after the king lay beside his fathers."
Ii Kings 14:23,"In year fifteen of the years of Amatzyahu son of Yehoash king of Judah,
Yorov’am son of Yoash became king over Israel at Shomeron,
for forty-one years."
Ii Kings 14:24,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
he did not turn aside from all the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin."
Ii Kings 14:25,"It was he who restored the border of Israel
from Levo-Hamat to the Sea of the Plain,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel
which he had spoken by the hand of his servant Yona son of Amittai the prophet, who was from Gat Ha-Heyfer,"
Ii Kings 14:26,"for Y<small>HWH</small> saw the affliction of Israel, exceedingly bitter [as it was],
with none but the fettered, none but the forsaken—
and no one to help Israel."
Ii Kings 14:27,"But Y<small>HWH</small> had not resolved to wipe out the name of Israel from under the heavens,
so he delivered them by the hand of Yorov’am son of Yoash."
Ii Kings 14:28,"Now the rest of the events of Yorov’am and all that he did, his mighty-deeds when he waged battle,
how he recovered Damascus and Hamat for Israel—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
Ii Kings 14:29,"Yorov’am lay beside his fathers, beside the kings of Israel,
and Zekharyahu his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 15:1,"In year twenty-seven of the years of Yorov’am king of Israel,
Azarya son of Amatzya king of Judah became king."
Ii Kings 15:2,"Sixteen years old was he at his becoming king,
and for fifty-two years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Yekholyahu, from Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 15:3,"He did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
exactly as Amatzya his father had done."
Ii Kings 15:4,"However, the sanctuaries were not removed;
the people were still offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke at the sanctuaries."
Ii Kings 15:5,"And Y<small>HWH</small> afflicted the king, so that he had <i>tzaraat</i> until the day of his death;
he had to stay in the Separate House,
while Yotam the king’s son was [The One] Over the House,
leading the Landed People."
Ii Kings 15:6,"Now the rest of the events of Azaryahu, and all that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the
Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 15:7,"Azarya lay beside his fathers;
they buried him beside his fathers, in the City of David,
and Yotam his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 15:8,"In year thirty-eight of the years of Azaryahu king of Judah,
Zekharyahu son of Yorov’am became king over Israel in Shomeron, for six months."
Ii Kings 15:9,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, as his fathers had done:
he did not turn aside from the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin."
Ii Kings 15:10,"And Shallum son of Yavesh conspired against him;
he struck him down at Yivle’am, and put him to death, and became king in his place."
Ii Kings 15:11,"Now the rest of the events of Zekharya—
here, they are written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel."
Ii Kings 15:12,"That is the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he spoke to Yehu, saying:
Sons to the fourth generation shall have seat for you on the throne of Israel.
And thus it was."
Ii Kings 15:13,"Shallum son of Yavesh became king in year thirty-nine of the years of Uziyya king of Judah;
he reigned as king for a month of days in Shomeron."
Ii Kings 15:14,"And Menahem son of Gadi, from Tirtza, went up and came to Shomeron;
he struck down Shallum son of Yavesh in Shomeron, and put him to death, and became king in his place."
Ii Kings 15:15,"Now the rest of the events of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he conspired—
here, they are written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel."
Ii Kings 15:16,"Then Menahem struck Tappuah and all who were in it, and its territory, [proceeding] from Tirtza, since it would not open [its gates];
he struck it, and all its pregnant women he split open."
Ii Kings 15:17,"In year thirty-nine of the years of Azarya king of Judah,
Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel,
for twenty years in Shomeron."
Ii Kings 15:18,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
he did not turn aside from the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin."
Ii Kings 15:19,"In his days, Pul king of Assyria came against the land,
and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver to have his hands be with him, to keep the kingdom strong in his hand."
Ii Kings 15:20,"And Menahem imposed a silver [payment] on Israel, from all the mighty-men of value, to give [as payment] to the king of Assyria:
fifty <i>shekels</i> of silver for [each] one man.
So the king of Assyria turned back,
and did not stay there in the land."
Ii Kings 15:21,"Now the rest of the events of Menahem, and all that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
Ii Kings 15:22,"Menahem lay beside his fathers,
and Pekahya his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 15:23,"In year fifty of the years of Azarya king of Judah,
Pekahya son of Menahem became king over Israel in Shomeron, for two years."
Ii Kings 15:24,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
he did not turn aside from the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin."
Ii Kings 15:25,"And Pekah son of Remalyahu, his officer, conspired against him;
he struck him down in Shomeron, in the citadel of the king’s house, with [men from] Argov and the Aryei
—and along with him were fifty men of the Children of the Gil’adites—
and he put him to death and became king in his place."
Ii Kings 15:26,"Now the rest of the events of Pekahya, and all that he did—
here, they are written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel."
Ii Kings 15:27,"In year fifty-two of the years of Azarya king of Judah,
Pekah son of Remalyahu became king over Israel in Shomeron,
for twenty years."
Ii Kings 15:28,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
he did not turn aside from the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin."
Ii Kings 15:29,"In the days of Pekah king of Israel,
Tiglat Pil’eser king of Assyria came;
he took Iyyon and Avel Bet-Maakha and Yanoah and Kedesh and Hatzor
and the Gil’ad and the Galilee,
all the region of Naftali,
and he exiled them to Assyria."
Ii Kings 15:30,"Then Hoshe’a son of Ela conspired a conspiracy against Pekah son of Remalyahu;
he struck him down and put him to death, and became king in his place,
in year twenty of Yotam son of Uziyya."
Ii Kings 15:31,"Now the rest of the events of Pekah, and all that he did—
here, they are written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel."
Ii Kings 15:32,"In year two of Pekah son of Remalyahu king of Israel,
Yotam son of Uziyyahu became king, king in Judah."
Ii Kings 15:33,"Twenty-five years old was he when he became king,
and for sixteen years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Yerusha daughter of Tzadok."
Ii Kings 15:34,"He did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
exactly as Uziyyahu his father had done, he did."
Ii Kings 15:35,"However, the sanctuaries were not removed;
the people were still offering-sacrifices and sending-up-smoke at the sanctuaries.
It was he who built the Upper Gate of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 15:36,"Now the rest of the events of Yotam, which he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 15:37,"In those days
Y<small>HWH</small> first sent out against Judah
Retzin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remalya."
Ii Kings 15:38,"Yotam lay beside his fathers;
he was buried with his fathers in the City of David, his father,
and Ahaz his son became king in his place."
Ii Kings 16:1,"In year seventeen of the years of Pekah son of Remalyahu,
Ahaz son of Yotam, king of Judah became king."
Ii Kings 16:2,"Twenty years old was he at his becoming king,
and for sixteen years he reigned as king in Jerusalem.
He did not do what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small> his God, like David his father,"
Ii Kings 16:3,"but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel,
and even had his son cross through the fire,
[just] like the abominations of the nations whom Y<small>HWH</small> had dispossessed before the Children of Israel."
Ii Kings 16:4,"He offered-sacrifices and sent-up-smoke at the sanctuaries and on the hilltops,
and under every luxuriant tree."
Ii Kings 16:5,"Then Retzin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remalyahu king of Israel went up to Jerusalem for battle;
they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome [him] in battle."
Ii Kings 16:6,"—At that time Retzin king of Aram restored Elat to Edom:
he expelled the Judahites from Elat,
while Edomites came to Elat and settled there, until this day.—"
Ii Kings 16:7,"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglat Pil’eser king of Assyria, saying:
Your servant and your son am I!
Come up and deliver me from the hand of the king of Aram and from the hand of the king of Israel, who have risen up against me!"
Ii Kings 16:8,"And Ahaz took the silver and the gold that were found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and in the treasuries of the king’s house,
and sent a bribe to the king of Assyria."
Ii Kings 16:9,"And the king of Assyria hearkened to his [plea];
the king of Assyria went up to Damascus, seized it, and exiled it to Kir,
while Retzin he put to death."
Ii Kings 16:10,"Then King Ahaz went to meet Tiglat Pil’eser king of Assyria at Damascus,
and he saw the sacrificial-altar that was in Damascus,
so King Ahaz sent to Uriyya the priest a likeness of the altar and its pattern, including all [the details for] its making."
Ii Kings 16:11,"And Uriyya the priest built the altar;
exactly as King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Uriyya the priest make,
by the time King Ahaz came back from Damascus."
Ii Kings 16:12,"The king came back from Damascus,
and the king looked over the altar.
Then the king drew near to the altar, and went up on it;"
Ii Kings 16:13,"he sent-up-in-smoke his offering-up and his gift-offering, and poured out his poured-offering,
and he sprinkled the blood of the <i>shalom</i>-offerings that he had against the altar."
Ii Kings 16:14,"As for the bronze altar that was in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
he brought it near from in front of the House, from between the [new] altar and the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and placed it on the flank of the [new] altar, northward."
Ii Kings 16:15,"And King Ahaz commanded Uriyya the priest, saying:
On the large altar, send-up-in-smoke the morning offering-up, the evening gift, the offering-up of the king and his grain-gift,
and the offering-up of all the Landed People and their gifts, along with their poured-offerings;
and all the blood of the offerings-up and all the blood of the [<i>shalom-</i>]sacrifice, you are to sprinkle against it,
while the bronze altar is to be mine to frequent."
Ii Kings 16:16,"So Uriyya the priest did
just as King Ahaz had commanded."
Ii Kings 16:17,"And King Ahaz stripped the rims of the stands
and removed the basin from them,
while the Sea he took down from the bronze oxen that were beneath it,
and placed it on the pavement of stones;"
Ii Kings 16:18,"and the covered-passage for the Sabbath which they had built in the House and the king’s outer entrance, he removed from the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
on account of the king of Assyria."
Ii Kings 16:19,"Now the rest of the events of Ahaz, [and] what he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 16:20,"Ahaz lay beside his fathers;
he was buried with his fathers, in the City of David,
and Hizkiyyahu his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 17:1,"In year twelve of Ahaz king of Judah,
Hoshe’a son of Ela became king in Shomeron, over Israel,
for nine years."
Ii Kings 17:2,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>—
however, not like the kings of Israel who were before him."
Ii Kings 17:3,"Against him Shalman’eser king of Assyria came up,
and Hoshe’a became servant to him
and rendered him tribute."
Ii Kings 17:4,"But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshe’a,
in that he sent messengers to So king of Egypt
and did not send up tribute to the king of Assyria as year after year.
So the king of Assyria arrested him and bound him over to the prison house."
Ii Kings 17:5,"And the king of Assyria went up throughout all the land;
he went up to Shomeron and laid siege to it, for three years."
Ii Kings 17:6,"In the ninth year of Hoshe’a, the king of Assyria captured Shomeron,
and he exiled Israel to Assyria;
he settled them in Halah and on the Havor, the River Gozan, and the towns of Media."
Ii Kings 17:7,"So it was,
because the Children of Israel had sinned against Y<small>HWH</small> their God,
the one bringing them up from the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt,
and had held other gods in awe,"
Ii Kings 17:8,"and had walked in the customs of the nations which Y<small>HWH</small> had dispossessed before the Israelites
and of the kings of Israel, which they had observed;"
Ii Kings 17:9,"and the Children of Israel had imputed things which are not so to Y<small>HWH</small> their God,
and had built themselves sanctuaries throughout all their towns,
from guards’ tower to fortified town;"
Ii Kings 17:10,"and had set up standing-pillars and Ashera-poles for themselves, on every lofty hill and beneath every luxuriant tree,"
Ii Kings 17:11,"and had sent-up-smoke there, at all the sanctuaries, like the nations whom Y<small>HWH</small> had exiled before them,
and had done evil things, to provoke Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Ii Kings 17:12,"and had served Illicit-Things
about which Y<small>HWH</small> had said to them:
You are not to do this thing!"
Ii Kings 17:13,"And Y<small>HWH</small> had warned Israel and Judah by the hand of every prophet, every seer, saying:
Turn back from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my regulations,
according to all the Instruction that I commanded your fathers
and which I sent to them by the hand of my servants the prophets."
Ii Kings 17:14,"But they had not hearkened;
they had hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers,
who had not trusted in Y<small>HWH</small> their God,"
Ii Kings 17:15,"and they had rejected his rules and his covenant which he had cut with their fathers,
and his warnings by which he had warned them;
and they had walked after futility and became futile [themselves],
and after the nations that were around them, about whom Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded them to not do like them;"
Ii Kings 17:16,"they had abandoned all the commandments of Y<small>HWH</small> their God
and had made for themselves something molten—two calves,
and had made an Ashera-pole
and bowed down to all the Forces of the Heavens
and served Baal;"
Ii Kings 17:17,"and they had made their sons and their daughters cross through the fire,
and they had augured augury and practiced divination,
and had sold themselves to do what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, provoking him—"
Ii Kings 17:18,"so Y<small>HWH</small> became exceedingly angry at Israel, and he removed them from his presence;
none remained, save the tribe of Judah alone."
Ii Kings 17:19,"But even Judah did not keep the commandments of Y<small>HWH</small> their God;
they walked in the customs of Israel which they had observed."
Ii Kings 17:20,"And so Y<small>HWH</small> rejected all the seed of Israel;
he afflicted them and gave them into the hand of pillagers,
until he had cast them out from his presence."
Ii Kings 17:21,"When he had torn Israel away from the House of David
and had made Yorov’am son of Nevat king,
Yorov’am had led Israel away from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>
and had caused them to sin a great sin."
Ii Kings 17:22,"And the Children of Israel had walked in all the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat which he wrought,
and had not turned aside from it,"
Ii Kings 17:23,"until Y<small>HWH</small> removed Israel from his presence,
as he had promised by the hand of all his servants the prophets.
So Israel was exiled from its soil to Assyria,
until this day."
Ii Kings 17:24,"And the king of Assyria brought [people] from Babylon, from Kuta, from Avva, from Hamat, and from Sefarvayim,
and settled them in the towns of Shomeron, in place of the Children of Israel;
they took possession of Shomeron, and settled in her towns."
Ii Kings 17:25,"Now it was:
at the start of their settlement there, they did not hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe,
so Y<small>HWH</small> sent out lions against them,
and they were killing [some] among them."
Ii Kings 17:26,"So they said to the king of Assyria, saying:
The nations whom you exiled and resettled in the towns of Shomeron
do not know the practices of the god of the land,
so he has sent out lions against them;
here, they are causing their death,
as they do not know the practices of the god of the land."
Ii Kings 17:27,"So the king of Assyria commanded, saying:
Have one of the priests whom I exiled from there go there,
let him go and settle there, and instruct them in the practices of the god of the land."
Ii Kings 17:28,"So one of the priests whom they had exiled from Shomeron came
and settled at Bet-El,
and he was instructing them how they should hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe."
Ii Kings 17:29,"But each-nation, each-nation went on making their own gods;
they put them in the sanctuary buildings that the Shomeronites had made,
each-nation, each-nation in their towns in which they had settled:"
Ii Kings 17:30,"the men of Bavel made Sukkot Benot,
and the men of Kut made Nergal,
and the men of Hamat made Ashima,"
Ii Kings 17:31,"and the Awites made Nivhaz and Tartak,
and the Sefarvites were burning their children in fire to Adrammelekh and to Anammelekh, the gods of Sefarvayim."
Ii Kings 17:32,"Now they went on holding Y<small>HWH</small> in awe,
but they [also] made for themselves, from [all] their quarters, priests for the sanctuaries;
they went on making [worship] for them at the sanctuary buildings."
Ii Kings 17:33,"Now Y<small>HWH</small> they held in awe,
while their gods they went on serving,
according to the practice of the nations from among whom they had been exiled."
Ii Kings 17:34,"To this day they do, according to their earlier practices:
they do not hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe;
they do not do according to their laws, according to their practice,
or according to the Instructions and the commandments that Y<small>HWH</small> commanded the Children of Yaakov, whose name he appointed Israel."
Ii Kings 17:35,"But Y<small>HWH</small> had cut a covenant with them and had commanded them, saying:
You are not to hold other gods in awe,
you are not to bow down to them,
you are not to serve them,
and you are not to sacrifice to them!"
Ii Kings 17:36,"Rather, Y<small>HWH</small>,
who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm,
him you are to hold in awe,
to him you are to bow down, to him you are to sacrifice!"
Ii Kings 17:37,"The laws and the practices, the instruction and the commandment that he wrote down for you,
you are to keep, observing it all the days [of your life];
you are not to hold other gods in awe!"
Ii Kings 17:38,"The covenant that I cut with you, you are not to forget;
you are not to hold other gods in awe!"
Ii Kings 17:39,"Rather, Y<small>HWH</small> your God you are to hold in awe—
and <i>he</i> will rescue you from the hand of all your enemies."
Ii Kings 17:40,"But they did not hearken,
rather, according to their former practice they went on doing."
Ii Kings 17:41,"So these nations have been holding Y<small>HWH</small> in awe,
but their idols they have gone on serving,
and also their children and their children’s children:
as their fathers did, [so] they go on doing,
until this day."
Ii Kings 18:1,"Now it was in year three of Hoshe’a son of Ela, king of Israel:
Hizkiyya son of Ahaz, king of Judah, became king."
Ii Kings 18:2,"Twenty-five years old was he at his becoming king,
and for twenty-nine years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Avi daughter of Zekharya."
Ii Kings 18:3,"He did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
exactly as David his father had done:"
Ii Kings 18:4,"it was he who removed the sanctuaries
and smashed the standing-pillars
and cut down the Ashera-pole
and crushed to bits the Viper of Copper that Moshe had made,
for until those days, the Children of Israel used to send-up-smoke to it
—it was called Copperviper."
Ii Kings 18:5,"On Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel did he rely;
after him there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah,
[nor] of those who were before him."
Ii Kings 18:6,"He clung to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and did not turn aside from [following] after him,
but he kept his commandments, which Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Ii Kings 18:7,"So Y<small>HWH</small> was with him;
wherever he went out, he prospered.
He rose-in-revolt against the king of Assyria, and would not serve him."
Ii Kings 18:8,"It was he who struck the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territories,
from guards’ tower to fortified town."
Ii Kings 18:9,"Now it was in the fourth year of King Hizkiyyahu
—that is the seventh year of Hoshe’a son of Ela king of Israel—
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Shomeron and laid siege to it,"
Ii Kings 18:10,"and he took it at the end of three years;
in year six of Hizkiyyahu—that is year nine of Hoshe’a king of Israel—
Shomeron was captured."
Ii Kings 18:11,"The king of Assyria exiled Israel to Assyria;
he led them off to Halah and Havor, the River Gozan and the towns of Media,"
Ii Kings 18:12,"because they had not hearkened to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small> their God,
but had crossed his covenant,
all that he had commanded Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>—
they had not hearkened, they had not done [it.]"
Ii Kings 18:13,"In the fourteenth year of King Hizkiyya,
Sanheriv king of Assyria came up against all the fortified towns of Judah and seized them."
Ii Kings 18:14,"And Hizkiyya king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lakhish, saying:
I have sinned—turn back from me;
whatever you place upon me, I will bear.
So the king of Assyria imposed upon Hizkiyya king of Judah
three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold;"
Ii Kings 18:15,"and Hizkiyya gave over all the silver that was found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>
and in the treasuries of the king’s house."
Ii Kings 18:16,"At that time,
Hizkiyya stripped the doors of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Great-Hall,
and the posts which Hizkiyya king of Judah had overlaid,
and gave them to the king of Assyria."
Ii Kings 18:17,"But the king of Assyria sent the Field-Marshal and the Chief Official and the Chief Cupbearer from Lakhish to King Hizkiyyahu with a weighty army to Jerusalem;
they went up and came to Jerusalem,
and when they had gone up and come, they stopped at the channel of the Upper Pool that is by the road of the Washer’s Field"
Ii Kings 18:18,"and called for the king.
And Elyakim son of Hilkiyyahu, [The One] Over the House,
and Shevna the [Royal] Scribe
and Yoah son of Asaf the Herald went out to them."
Ii Kings 18:19,"The Chief Cupbearer said to them:
Now say to Hizkiyyahu:
Thus says the Great King, the king of Assyria:
What is this reliance on which you rely?"
Ii Kings 18:20,"Do you really think that [mere] words from lips
are counsel and might for battle?
Now, on whom do you rely, that you have risen-in-revolt against me?"
Ii Kings 18:21,"Now here, you have relied for yourself on this snapped shaft of a reed, on Egypt,
which when a man leans on it, it enters his palm and punctures it!
That is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him!"
Ii Kings 18:22,"And if you say to me:
On Y<small>HWH</small> our God we rely—
is it not he whose sanctuaries and whose altars Hizkiyyahu removed
and said to Judah and to Jerusalem:
Before this sacrificial-altar [alone] you are to bow down, in Jerusalem!?"
Ii Kings 18:23,"So-now, pray make a wager with my lord, with the king of Assyria:
I will give you two thousand horses
if you are able to place riders upon them!"
Ii Kings 18:24,"So how will you turn away the face of a single governor of the least of my lord’s servants?
Yet you rely for yourself on Egypt for chariotry and horsemen!"
Ii Kings 18:25,"And now [too],
is it without Y<small>HWH</small> that I have come up against this place, to bring it to ruin?
It is Y<small>HWH</small> who said to me:
Go up against this land and wreak ruin upon it!"
Ii Kings 18:26,"Then Elyakim son of Hilkiyyahu and Shevna and Yoah to the Chief Cupbearer said:
Pray speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it,
but do not speak with us in Judean within earshot of the fighting-people who are on the wall!"
Ii Kings 18:27,"But the Chief Cupbearer said to them:
Is it to your lord and to you that my lord has sent me to speak these words?
Is it not to the men sitting on the wall,
[who will have] to eat their filth and drink the “water of their legs” with you?"
Ii Kings 18:28,"And the Chief Cupbearer stood forth and called out in a loud voice in Judean,
he spoke and said:
Hearken to the word of the Great King, the king of Assyria:"
Ii Kings 18:29,"Thus says the king:
Do not let Hizkiyyahu deceive you,
for he is not able to rescue you from my hand,"
Ii Kings 18:30,"and do not let Hizkiyyahu make you rely on Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> will rescue, yes, rescue us;
this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!"
Ii Kings 18:31,"Do not hearken to Hizkiyyahu,
for thus says the king of Assyria:
Make me a blessing-gift, and come out to me [in surrender],
and each will eat of his vine, each of his fig tree,
and each will drink waters of his cistern,"
Ii Kings 18:32,"until my coming to take you away to a land like your land,
a land of new-wine and grain, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of shining olive oil and honey,
that you may live and not die.
So do not hearken to Hizkiyyahu
when he incites you, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> will rescue us!"
Ii Kings 18:33,"Did the gods of the [other] nations rescue, yes, rescue their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?"
Ii Kings 18:34,"Where are the gods of Hamat or Arpad?
Where are the gods of Sefarvayim, Heina, and Ivva?
Indeed, did they rescue Shomeron from my hand?"
Ii Kings 18:35,"Who is it among all the gods of these lands that rescued their land from my hand,
that Y<small>HWH</small> should rescue Jerusalem from my hand?"
Ii Kings 18:36,"But the people were silent, and did not answer him a word,
for it was the king’s command, saying:
You are not to answer him!"
Ii Kings 18:37,"Then Elyakim son of Hilkiyya, [The One] Over the Household, and Shevna the Scribe, and Yoah son of Asaf the Herald, came to Hizkiyyahu, with torn garments,
and they told him the words of the Chief Cupbearer."
Ii Kings 19:1,"It was, when King Hizkiyyahu heard,
that he tore his garments
and covered himself in sackcloth
and came into the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 19:2,"Then he sent Elyakim, [The One] Over the Household, and Shevna the Scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered in sackcloth,
to Yesha’yahu the prophet, son of Amotz;"
Ii Kings 19:3,"they said to him:
Thus says Hizkiyyahu:
A day of distress, rebuke, and scorn is this day,
for children have come to the womb-breaking,
but strength there is none for giving birth!"
Ii Kings 19:4,"Perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> your God will hear all the words of the Chief Cupbearer with which the king of Assyria, his lord, sent him to mock the Living God
and will give rebuke because of the words that Y<small>HWH</small> your God has heard—
so lift up a prayer on behalf of the remnant that is found!"
Ii Kings 19:5,"So the servants of King Hizkiyyahu came to Yesha’yahu,"
Ii Kings 19:6,"and Yesha’yahu said to them:
Thus are you to say to your lord:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
Do not be afraid before the words that you have heard,
with which the serving-lads of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me!"
Ii Kings 19:7,"Here, I will put a spirit in him,
so that he hears some hearsay and has to return to his land,
and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his land!"
Ii Kings 19:8,"The Chief Cupbearer returned and found the king of Assyria engaging in battle against Livna,
for he had heard that he had marched on from Lakhish."
Ii Kings 19:9,"He heard [a report] about Tirhaka king of Kush, saying:
Here, he has gone out to engage in battle with you!
So he sent messengers back to Hizkiyyahu, saying:
Thus are you to say to Hizkiyyahu king of Judah, saying:"
Ii Kings 19:10,"Do not let your God on whom you rely beguile you, saying [to yourself]:
Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!"
Ii Kings 19:11,"Here, <i>you</i> have heard what the kings of Assyria did to all the [other] lands, devoting-them-to-destruction—
so will <i>you</i> be rescued?"
Ii Kings 19:12,"Did the gods of the nations whom my fathers brought to ruin rescue them:
Gozan and Harran,
Retzef and the Children of Ehden who were in Telassar?"
Ii Kings 19:13,"Where is he, the king of Hamat, or the king of Arpad, or the king of La’ir, of Sefarvayim, Heina, and Ivva?"
Ii Kings 19:14,"Hizkiyyahu took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it;
then he went up to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and Hizkiyyahu spread it out in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 19:15,"And Hizkiyyahu prayed in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, he said:
O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel, [Who is] Seated on the Winged-Sphinxes,
you are God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth;
<i>you</i> made the heavens and the earth."
Ii Kings 19:16,"Incline, O Y<small>HWH</small>, your ear and hearken;
open, O Y<small>HWH</small>, your eyes and see,
and hear the words of Sanheriv which he sent to mock the Living God!"
Ii Kings 19:17,"In truth, O Y<small>HWH</small>, the kings of Assyria have laid waste to nations and their land[s],"
Ii Kings 19:18,"and they have put their gods to the fire
—for they are not gods,
but the work of human hands, wood and stone—
so they have demolished them."
Ii Kings 19:19,"But now, O Y<small>HWH</small> our God,
pray deliver us from his hand,
so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, Y<small>HWH</small>, are God, you alone!"
Ii Kings 19:20,"And Yesha’yahu son of Amotz sent [word] to Hizkiyyahu, saying:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
That which you prayed to me concerning Sanheriv king of Assyria, I have heard."
Ii Kings 19:21,"This is the word that Y<small>HWH</small> speaks concerning him:
She despises you, she derides you,
the Nubile Daughter of Zion;
after you, she shakes her head after you,
the Daughter of Jerusalem:"
Ii Kings 19:22,"Whom have you mocked and blasphemed?
Against whom have your raised [your] voice?
You have lifted up your eyes on high
against the Holy One of Israel!"
Ii Kings 19:23,"By the hand of your messengers you have mocked Y<small>HWH</small>,
you said: With my vast chariotry
<i>I</i> have gone up the loftiest mountains,
the flanks of the Levanon;
I cut down the highest of its cedars,
the choicest of its junipers.
And I came to its farthest lodge,
its garden-like forest."
Ii Kings 19:24,"It was I who dug and drank
the water of strangers,
and I dried up with the soles of my feet
all the Nile-streams of Egypt."
Ii Kings 19:25,"Have you not heard? From of old I did it,
in former days I fashioned it;
now I bring it to pass,
and it is:
crashing into wrecked heaps
fortified towns,"
Ii Kings 19:26,"while their settled-folk, short-armed,
were dismayed and confounded.
They were [like] the herbage of the field,
the green grass,
the straw of the rooftops, blasted
before the east wind;"
Ii Kings 19:27,"your staying, your going, and your coming I know,
[yes], and your raging against me."
Ii Kings 19:28,"Because you have raged against me,
and your roaring has ascended to my ears,
I will put my hook in your nostrils
and my bridle in your lips,
and I will turn you back on the way
by which you came."
Ii Kings 19:29,"And this shall be the sign for you:
eat this year the wild-growth,
and in the second year, the aftergrowth,
and in the third year, sow and harvest and plant vineyards,
and eat their fruit."
Ii Kings 19:30,"And the survivors of the House of Judah, the remaining ones,
will add rootgrowth below,
and will produce fruit above;"
Ii Kings 19:31,"for from Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant,
and the survivors from Mount Zion
—the zeal of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High will do this!"
Ii Kings 19:32,"Therefore, thus says Y<small>HWH</small> concerning the king of Assyria:
He shall not enter this city,
he shall not shoot an arrow there,
he shall not advance upon it [with a] shield,
he shall not pile up a siege-mound against it!"
Ii Kings 19:33,"By the way that he came, he shall return,
but this city he shall not enter
—the Utterance of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Kings 19:34,"And I will shield this city to deliver it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant."
Ii Kings 19:35,"It was on that very night
that the messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> went forth
and struck down in the camp of Assyria a hundred and eighty-five thousand;
they started-early at daybreak,
and here, all of them were corpses, dead men!"
Ii Kings 19:36,"So Sanheriv king of Assyria marched off and went away and returned [home],
and stayed in Nineveh."
Ii Kings 19:37,"Now it was, when he was bowing down in the house of Nisrokh his god,
that Adrammelekh and Sar’etzer his sons struck him down with the sword.
They escaped to the land of Ararat,
and Esar-haddon his son became king in his place."
Ii Kings 20:1,"In those days,
Hizkiyyahu became sick, to [the point of] death.
And Yesha’yahu son of Amotz, the prophet, came to him and said to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
Charge your household,
for you are about to die, and will not live!"
Ii Kings 20:2,"He turned his face to the wall
and prayed to Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
Ii Kings 20:3,"Please, O Y<small>HWH</small>,
pray recall how I have walked about before you with truthfulness and with a whole heart,
and what was good in your eyes, I have done!
And Hizkiyyahu wept with a great weeping."
Ii Kings 20:4,"Now Yesha’yahu had not yet gone out of the middle courtyard
when the word of Y<small>HWH</small> [came] to him, saying:"
Ii Kings 20:5,"Return, you are to say to Hizkiyyahu, <i>Nagid</i> of my people:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of David your father:
I have heard your prayer,
I have seen your tears.
Here, I am healing you;
on the third day, you will go up to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 20:6,"I will add fifteen years to your days,
and from the grasp of the king of Assyria I will rescue you, along with this city;
I will shield this city
for my sake and for the sake of David my servant."
Ii Kings 20:7,"Then Yesha’yahu said:
Fetch a cake of figs.
They fetched it and placed it on the boil,
and he lived."
Ii Kings 20:8,"And Hizkiyyahu said to Yesha’yahu:
What is the sign that Y<small>HWH</small> will heal me,
so that I may go up by the third day to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>?"
Ii Kings 20:9,"Yesha’yahu said:
This will be for you the sign from Y<small>HWH</small>
that Y<small>HWH</small> will do the thing that he has promised:
the shadow has gone forward ten steps;
can it return ten steps?"
Ii Kings 20:10,"He said:
It is easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps;
not so, that the shadow can return backward ten steps."
Ii Kings 20:11,"So Yesha’yahu the prophet called out to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and he made the shadow return by the steps by which it had gone down on the step-dial of Ahaz, backward by ten steps."
Ii Kings 20:12,"At [about] that time,
Merodakh Bal’adan son of Bal’adan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hizkiyyahu,
for he had heard that Hizkiyyahu was sick."
Ii Kings 20:13,"And Hizkiyyahu was pleased with them,
and he had them see his whole storehouse—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the fine oil,
his weapons house,
and all that was to be found in his treasuries.
There was not a thing that Hizkiyyahu did not have them see in his house or in all his kingdom."
Ii Kings 20:14,"Then Yesha’yahu the prophet came to King Hizkiyyahu and said to him:
What did these men say,
and from where do they come to you?
Hizkiyyahu said:
From a land far away they came, from Babylon."
Ii Kings 20:15,"He said:
What did they see in your house?
He said:
Everything that is in my house they saw;
there was not a thing that I did not have them see in my treasuries."
Ii Kings 20:16,"Then Yesha’yahu said to Hizkiyyahu:
Hear the word of Y<small>HWH</small>:"
Ii Kings 20:17,"Here, days are coming
when everything in your house will be carried off,
[all] that your fathers amassed-as-treasure up until this day, to Babylon;
there will not be a thing left, says Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Ii Kings 20:18,"And some of your sons who have issued from you, whom you have begotten, will be taken away,
and they will become officials in the Great-Hall of the king of Babylon."
Ii Kings 20:19,"Hizkiyyahu said to Yesha’yahu:
Good is the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that you have spoken.
For he said [to himself]:
Will there not [at least] be trustworthy peace in my days?"
Ii Kings 20:20,"Now the rest of the events of Hizkiyyahu, and all his mighty-deeds,
—how he made the pool and the channel, and brought the waters into the city—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 20:21,"Hizkiyyahu lay beside his fathers,
and Menashe his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 21:1,"Twelve years old was Menashe at his becoming king,
and for fifty-five years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Heftzi-va."
Ii Kings 21:2,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
according to the abominations of the nations that Y<small>HWH</small> had dispossessed before the Children of Israel:"
Ii Kings 21:3,"he once again built the sanctuaries that Hizkiyyahu his father had demolished,
and erected sacrificial-altars to Baal,
and made an Ashera-pole, just as Ah’av king of Israel had made,
and bowed down to all the Forces of the Heavens, and served them;"
Ii Kings 21:4,"he built sacrificial-altars in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>
about which Y<small>HWH</small> had said: In Jerusalem I will set my name!,"
Ii Kings 21:5,"and he built sacrificial-altars to all the Forces of the Heavens
in the two courtyards of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;"
Ii Kings 21:6,"he had his son cross through the fire
and practiced soothsaying and divination, made [contact with] ghosts and all-knowing ones—
he did much that was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, to provoke him."
Ii Kings 21:7,"And he placed the statue of Ashera that he had made
in the House about which Y<small>HWH</small> had said to David and to Shelomo his son:
In this House in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel,
I will set my name for the ages,"
Ii Kings 21:8,"and I will not continue to make Israel’s foot wander from the soil that I gave to their fathers;
if only they take care to observe according to all that I have commanded them,
including all the Instruction that my servant Moshe commanded them."
Ii Kings 21:9,"But they did not hearken,
and Menashe led them astray to do what was evil, more than the nations that Y<small>HWH</small> had wiped out before the Children of Israel."
Ii Kings 21:10,"So Y<small>HWH</small> spoke by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying:"
Ii Kings 21:11,"Because Menashe king of Judah has done these abominations,
practicing more evil than all that the Amorites did who were before him,
and has caused Judah too to sin with his Illicit-Things,"
Ii Kings 21:12,"therefore,
thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Here, I am about to bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah
that all who hear of it, their two ears will ring!"
Ii Kings 21:13,"I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring-line of Shomeron and the plumb-bob of the House of Ah’av,
and I will wipe Jerusalem clean as one wipes a dish clean,
wiping and turning it over on its face."
Ii Kings 21:14,"And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance
and give them into the hand of their enemies,
so that they become spoil and pillage for all their enemies,"
Ii Kings 21:15,"because they have done what was evil in my eyes, and have been provoking me
from the day that their fathers went out of Egypt until this day."
Ii Kings 21:16,"—Now even more, Menashe spilled innocent blood, exceedingly much,
until he filled Jerusalem from one end to the [other] end,
aside from his sin by which he caused Judah to sin,
by doing what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 21:17,"Now the rest of the events of Menashe, and all that he did,
and the sins that he sinned—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 21:18,"Menashe lay beside his fathers;
he was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza,
and Amon his son reigned as king in his place."
Ii Kings 21:19,"Twenty-two years old was Amon at his becoming king,
and for two years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Meshullemet daughter of Harutz, from Yotva."
Ii Kings 21:20,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>, as Menashe his father had done:"
Ii Kings 21:21,"he walked in all the way that his father had walked,
and served the Illicit-Things that his father had served, and bowed down to them;"
Ii Kings 21:22,"he abandoned Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of his fathers,
and did not walk in the way of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 21:23,"And Amon’s [court-]servants conspired against him,
and put the king to death in his house."
Ii Kings 21:24,"But the Landed People struck down all those who had conspired against Amon,
and the Landed People made Yoshiyyahu his son king in his place."
Ii Kings 21:25,"Now the rest of the events of Amon, [and all] that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 21:26,"He was buried in his burial-place in the garden of Uzza,
and Yoshiyyahu his son became king in his place."
Ii Kings 22:1,"Eight years old was Yoshiyyahu at his becoming king,
and for thirty-one years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Yedida daughter of Adaya, from Botzkat."
Ii Kings 22:2,"He did what was right in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and walked in all the way of David his father;
he did not turn aside to the right or to the left."
Ii Kings 22:3,"Now it was in the eighteenth year of King Yoshiyyahu:
the king sent Shafan son of Atzalyahu son of Meshullam the Scribe to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:"
Ii Kings 22:4,"Go up to Hilkiyyahu the Great Priest and have him sum up the silver that has been brought to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
which the guardians of the threshold have gathered from the people,"
Ii Kings 22:5,"and let them give it into the hand of those doing the work, those accountable in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>;
they shall give it over to those doing the work who are in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, to strengthen the breaches in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>—"
Ii Kings 22:6,"to the carvers, to the builders, and to the wall-masons,
and for purchasing wood and hewn stone, to strengthen the House."
Ii Kings 22:7,"But there need not be reckoning with them for the silver that is given into their hand,
for in trustworthy-fashion they deal."
Ii Kings 22:8,"Then Hilkiyyahu the Great Priest said to Shafan the Scribe:
I have found a [written] Record of the Instruction in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>!
And Hilkiyyahu gave the record to Shafan, and he read it."
Ii Kings 22:9,"Then Shafan the Scribe came to the king
and returned word to the king;
he said:
Your servants have melted down the silver that was found in the House
and have given it over to the hand of those doing the work, those accountable in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 22:10,"And Shafan the Scribe told the king, saying:
Hilkiyya the priest has given me a [written] record.
And Shafan read it before the king."
Ii Kings 22:11,"It was, when the king heard the words of the Record of the Instruction,
that he tore his garments;"
Ii Kings 22:12,"and the king commanded Hilkiyya the priest and Ahikam son of Shafan and Akhbor son of Mikhaya and Shafan the Scribe and Asaya Servant of the king, saying:"
Ii Kings 22:13,"Go, inquire of Y<small>HWH</small> on my behalf, on behalf of the people, and on behalf of all Judah
concerning the words of this Record that has been found,
for great is the wrath of Y<small>HWH</small> that has been kindled against us
because our fathers did not hearken to the words of this Record,
to observe all that is written concerning us!"
Ii Kings 22:14,"So Hilkiyyahu the priest and Ahikam and Akhbor and Shafan and Asaya
went to Hulda the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tikva son of Harhas, Guardian of the [Royal] Garments
—now she was dwelling in Jerusalem, in the Second [District]—
and they spoke to her."
Ii Kings 22:15,"She said to them:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Say to the man who sent you to me:"
Ii Kings 22:16,"Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
Here, I am about to bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants,
all the words of the Record that the king of Judah has read,"
Ii Kings 22:17,"because they have abandoned me and sent-up-smoke to other gods,
in order to provoke me with all the works of their hands—
so my wrath will be kindled against this place, and will not be extinguished!"
Ii Kings 22:18,"But to the king of Judah, the one sending you to inquire of Y<small>HWH</small>,
thus you are to say to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
As for the words that you have heard,"
Ii Kings 22:19,"because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before Y<small>HWH</small>
when you heard what I spoke concerning this place and concerning its inhabitants,
to become a desolation and a curse,
and you tore your garments and wept before me,
I too have heard
—Y<small>HWH</small>’s Utterance."
Ii Kings 22:20,"Therefore,
here, I will gather you to your fathers;
you will be gathered to your burial-place in peace,
so that your eyes will not see all the evil that I am about to bring upon this place.
And they returned word to the king."
Ii Kings 23:1,"The king sent
and had all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem gathered to him."
Ii Kings 23:2,"Then the king went up to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him,
and the priests and the prophets and all the people, great and small,
and he read in their ears all the words of the Record of the Covenant that had been found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 23:3,"And the king stood by the standing-column
and cut a covenant in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>
to walk after Y<small>HWH</small>, to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his laws
with all [one’s] heart and with all [one’s] being,
to fulfill the words of this covenant that were written in this Record.
And all the people took a stand in the covenant."
Ii Kings 23:4,"Then the king charged Hilkiyyahu the Great Priest and the priests of second rank and the guardians of the threshold
to take out of the Great-Hall of Y<small>HWH</small>
all the vessels that had been made for Baal and for Ashera and for all the Forces of the Heavens,
and he burned them outside Jerusalem, on the terraces of Kidron,
and carried their ashes to Bet-El."
Ii Kings 23:5,"And he put an end to the clerics whom the kings of Judah had given-license to send-up-smoke at the sanctuaries in the towns of Judah and in the [sacred] places around Jerusalem,
namely, those who sent-up-smoke to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, and to the constellations,
and to all the Forces of the Heavens."
Ii Kings 23:6,"And he brought out the Ashera-pole from the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, outside Jerusalem, to the Wadi Kidron,
and burned it in the Wadi Kidron;
then he crushed it into dust
and threw its dust over the burial-ground of the [common] people."
Ii Kings 23:7,"And he demolished the houses of the [male] prostitutes that were in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
where the women had been weaving coverings for the Ashera-pole."
Ii Kings 23:8,"And he brought in all the priests from the towns of Judah,
and he rendered <i>tamei</i> the sanctuaries where the priests had sent-up-smoke
from Geva to Be’er-Sheva,
and he demolished the sanctuaries at the gates that were at the entrance to the gate of Yehoshua, commander of the city,
which were at a person’s left [entering] the gate of the city."
Ii Kings 23:9,"However, the priests of the sanctuaries did not go up to the sacrificial-altar of Y<small>HWH</small> in Jerusalem,
although they ate unleavened-bread among their brothers."
Ii Kings 23:10,"And he rendered <i>tamei</i> the <i>Tofet</i>/Hearth that is in the Valley of Ben Hinnom,
so that no [one could] cross his son or his daughter through the fire to the Molekh."
Ii Kings 23:11,"And he put an end to the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun at the entrance to the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
near the chamber of Natan-Melekh the Official that was in the [Temple] colonnade,
and the chariots of the sun he burned with fire."
Ii Kings 23:12,"And as for the sacrificial-altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made,
and the sacrificial-altars that Menashe had made in the two courtyards of the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
the king demolished them;
he hastened them from there and threw their rubble into the Wadi Kidron."
Ii Kings 23:13,"And the sanctuaries which were facing Jerusalem, which were to the right/south of the Mount of the Ruinbringer,
which Shelomo king of Israel had built to Astarte, the Detestable-One of the Sidonians,
to Kemosh the Detestable-One of Moav,
and to Milkom the Abominable-One of the Children of Ammon,
the king rendered <i>tamei</i>."
Ii Kings 23:14,"And he smashed the standing-pillars,
and cut down the Ashera-poles
and filled in their sites with human bones."
Ii Kings 23:15,"And also the sacrificial-altar that was at Bet-El, the sanctuary that Yorov’am son of Nevat made, [the one] who had caused Israel to sin,
also that altar and the sanctuary, he demolished,
and he burned the sanctuary and crushed it fine, into dust,
and he burned the Ashera-pole."
Ii Kings 23:16,"And Yoshiyyahu faced about
and saw the burial-places that were there on the hill,
so he sent and had the bones taken from the burial-places and burned on the altar, rendering it <i>tamei</i>,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which the man of God had proclaimed,
who had proclaimed these things."
Ii Kings 23:17,"Then he said:
What is this marker that I see?
The men of the town said to him:
It is the burial-place of the man of God who came from Judah,
who proclaimed these things that you have done against the sacrificial-altar of Bet-El."
Ii Kings 23:18,"He said:
Let it rest;
let no one disturb his bones!
So they let his bones be,
along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Shomeron."
Ii Kings 23:19,"And also all the sanctuary buildings that were in the towns of Shomeron
which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [Y<small>HWH</small>], Yoshiyyahu removed;
he dealt with them in accordance with all the deeds that he had done in Bet-El."
Ii Kings 23:20,"And he slew all the priests of the sanctuaries who were there, on the sacrificial-altars,
and burned human bones on them.
Then he returned to Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 23:21,"And the king commanded all the people, saying:
Observe the Passover to Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
as is written in this Record of the Covenant!"
Ii Kings 23:22,"—For no such Passover had been observed
since the days of the judge-leaders who led Israel,
and all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah."
Ii Kings 23:23,"But in the eighteenth year of King Yoshiyyahu
such a Passover was observed to Y<small>HWH</small> in Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 23:24,"And also the ghosts and the all-knowing ones, the <i>terafim</i> and the Illicit-Things,
and all the Detestable-Things that could be seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem,
Yoshiyyahu eradicated,
in order to fulfill the words of the Instruction, the ones written in the Record that Hilkiyyahu the priest had found in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Ii Kings 23:25,"Now like him there was none before him as king,
who turned back to Y<small>HWH</small> with all his heart, with all his being, and with all his substance,
in accordance with all the teaching of Moshe,
and after him there arose none like him."
Ii Kings 23:26,"Yet Y<small>HWH</small> did not turn back from his great flaming-anger, whose anger flared up against Judah,
on account of all the provocations with which Menashe had provoked him."
Ii Kings 23:27,"So Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Judah too I will remove from my presence,
just as I removed Israel,
and I will reject this city which I chose, Jerusalem,
along with the House about which I said: My name will be there!"
Ii Kings 23:28,"Now the rest of the events of Yoshiyyahu, and all that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 23:29,"In his days, Pharaoh Nekho king of Egypt came up to the king of Assyria, to the River Euphrates,
and King Yoshiyyahu marched out to meet him,
but he put him to death at Megiddo when he saw him."
Ii Kings 23:30,"His servants conveyed him dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem,
and they buried him in his burial-place.
And the Landed People took Yehoahaz son of Yoshiyyahu
and anointed him, making him king in place of his father."
Ii Kings 23:31,"Twenty-three years old was Yehoahaz at his becoming king,
and for three months he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Yirmeyahu, from Livna."
Ii Kings 23:32,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
exactly as his fathers had done."
Ii Kings 23:33,"And Pharaoh Nekho imprisoned him at Rivla, in the region of Hamat, from reigning as king in Jerusalem,
and placed a fine on the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold."
Ii Kings 23:34,"Pharaoh Nekho made Elyakim son of Yoshiyyahu king in place of Yoshiyyahu his father,
and changed his name to Yehoyakim,
while Yehoahaz he took away, so that he came to Egypt and died there."
Ii Kings 23:35,"Now the silver and the gold, Yehoyakim gave [as payment] to Pharaoh,
but he had to assess the land, in order to give the silver by order of Pharaoh:
from each one according to his assessment he exacted the silver and the gold, from the Landed People, to give to Pharaoh Nekho."
Ii Kings 23:36,"Twenty-five years old was Yehoyakim at his becoming king,
and for eleven years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Zevuda daughter of Pedaya, from Ruma."
Ii Kings 23:37,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
exactly as his fathers had done."
Ii Kings 24:1,"In his days, Nevukhadnetzar king of Babylon came up.
And Yehoyakim was servant to him for three years,
but then he turned and rose-in-revolt against him."
Ii Kings 24:2,"So Y<small>HWH</small> sent loose against him raiding-bands of Chaldeans, bands of Aram, bands of Moav, and bands of the Children of Ammon;
he sent them loose against Judah, to annihilate it,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had spoken by the hand of his servants the prophets."
Ii Kings 24:3,"Yes, at the order of Y<small>HWH</small> did all this [come] against Judah,
to remove them from his presence,
for the sins of Menashe, in accordance with all that he did,"
Ii Kings 24:4,"and also [because of] the innocent blood that he shed
—for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood—
so Y<small>HWH</small> was not willing to forgive."
Ii Kings 24:5,"Now the rest of the events of Yehoyakim, and all that he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Judah?"
Ii Kings 24:6,"Yehoyakim lay beside his fathers,
and Yehoyakhin his son became king in his place."
Ii Kings 24:7,"Now the king of Egypt no longer went out [to war] from his land any more,
for the king of Babylon had taken away, from the Wadi of Egypt to the River Euphrates,
all that had belonged to the king of Egypt."
Ii Kings 24:8,"Eighteen years old was Yehoyakhin at his becoming king,
and for three months he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnatan, from Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 24:9,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
exactly as his father had done."
Ii Kings 24:10,"At [about] that time, the servants of Nevukhadnetzar king of Babylon went up to Jerusalem,
and the city came under siege."
Ii Kings 24:11,"Nevukhadnetzar king of Babylon came to the city
while his servants were besieging it,"
Ii Kings 24:12,"and Yehoyakhin king of Judah went out [in surrender] to the king of Babylon,
he and his mother, his court-servants, his officers, and his officials,
and the king of Babylon took him [prisoner] in year eight of his being king."
Ii Kings 24:13,"And he brought out from there all the treasuries of the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and the treasuries of the king’s house;
he cut-to-pieces all the vessels of gold that Shelomo king of Israel had made in the Great-Hall of Y<small>HWH</small>,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had promised."
Ii Kings 24:14,"He exiled all of Jerusalem:
all the officers and all the mighty-men of valor,
ten thousand exiles,
and all the carvers and the smiths;
none remained, save the poorest of the people of the land."
Ii Kings 24:15,"And he exiled Yehoyakhin to Babylon,
while the king’s mother and the king’s wives and his officials and the “rams” of the land he made go into exile, from Jerusalem to Babylon,"
Ii Kings 24:16,"along with all the men of valor, seven thousand,
and the carvers and the smiths, a thousand,
all mighty-men, trained for battle;
the king of Babylon brought them into exile, to Babylon."
Ii Kings 24:17,"And the king of Babylon installed Mattanya his uncle as king in his place,
and changed his name to Tzidkiyyahu."
Ii Kings 24:18,"Twenty-one years old was Tzidkiyyahu at his becoming king,
and for eleven years he reigned as king in Jerusalem;
his mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Yirmeyahu, from Livna."
Ii Kings 24:19,"He did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
exactly as Yehoyakim had done."
Ii Kings 24:20,"Indeed, [it was] because of Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger that it happened in Jerusalem and in Judah,
until he cast them out from his presence.
And Tzidkiyyahu rose-in-revolt against the king of Babylon."
Ii Kings 25:1,"So it was in the ninth year of his being king,
in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month:
Nevukhadnetzar king of Babylon, he and all his army, came against Jerusalem;
they set up camp against it and built a bulwark against it, all around."
Ii Kings 25:2,And the city came under siege until the eleventh year of King Tzidkiyyahu.
Ii Kings 25:3,"On [day] nine of the [fourth] month, hunger became strong in the city;
there was no food [even] for the Landed People."
Ii Kings 25:4,"The city-wall was broken through,
[and Tzidkiyyahu] and all the men fit for battle [fled] at night through the gate between the double-walls that are near the king’s garden,
with the Chaldeans all around the city;
he went by the Road of the Plain."
Ii Kings 25:5,"But the Chaldean army pursued after the king
and overtook him in the Plains of Jericho,
with all his army having scattered from him."
Ii Kings 25:6,"They seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon, at Rivla,
and pronounced judgment upon him."
Ii Kings 25:7,"The sons of Tzidkiyyahu were slain before his eyes,
and Tzidkiyyahu’s eyes were blinded;
then they bound him with double-bronze and brought him to Babylon."
Ii Kings 25:8,"Now in the fifth month, on [day] seven of the month—that is the nineteenth year of King Nevukhadnetzar, king of Babylon,
Nevuzar’adan, Captain of the Guard, servant to the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem;"
Ii Kings 25:9,"he burned down the House of Y<small>HWH</small> and the king’s house
and all the houses of Jerusalem,
and every house of a great-one he burned with fire."
Ii Kings 25:10,"As for the walls of Jerusalem, all around,
they were demolished by all the Chaldean army that belonged to the Captain of the Guard."
Ii Kings 25:11,"And the rest of the people who remained in the city,
and those falling away who had fallen away to the king of Babylon, the rest of the masses,
Nevuzar’adan the Captain of the Guard exiled;"
Ii Kings 25:12,"but from the poor of the land, the Captain of the Guard allowed some to remain,
as vine-dressers and as husbandmen."
Ii Kings 25:13,"Now the bronze columns that were in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and the bases and the Bronze Sea that were in the House of Y<small>HWH</small>, the Chaldeans smashed,
and brought their bronze to Babylon."
Ii Kings 25:14,"And the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the ladles
and all the bronze vessels with which they attended, they took."
Ii Kings 25:15,"And the fire-pans and the forks that were of gold, [each of] gold, and of silver, [each of] silver—
the Captain of the Guard took."
Ii Kings 25:16,"Now the columns, two, the Sea, one, and the bases that Shelomo had made for the House of Y<small>HWH</small>,
were beyond weighing for bronze, all these vessels."
Ii Kings 25:17,"Eighteen cubits was the height of the one column,
with a crowning-capital for it of bronze,
and the height of the capital three cubits,
with a lattice-work and pomegranates on the capital, all around,
—all of it was bronze—
and like these for the second column, along with the lattice-work."
Ii Kings 25:18,"And the Captain of the Guard took Seraya the Head Priest and Tzefanyahu the Second Priest
and the three guardians of the threshold;"
Ii Kings 25:19,"and from the city he took an official who was [The One] Accountable for the Men of War,
and five men from Those [Who] See the King’s Face who were found in the city,
and the Scribe of the Commander of the Armed-Forces who mustered the forces of the Landed People,
and sixty men from the Landed People who were found in the city;"
Ii Kings 25:20,"Nevuzar’adan the Captain of the Guard took them
and brought them to the king of Babylon at Rivla."
Ii Kings 25:21,"And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Rivla, in the land of Hamat.
So Judah was exiled from its soil."
Ii Kings 25:22,"Now as for the people who remained in the land of Judah,
whom Nevukhadnetzar king of Babylon allowed to remain—
he appointed over them Gedalyahu son of Ahikam son of Shafan."
Ii Kings 25:23,"And all the commanders of the soldiers heard, they and their men, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedalyahu,
so they came to Gedalyahu at Mitzpa—
Yishmael son of Netanya, Yohanan son of Kare’ah, Seraya son of Tanhumet the Netofatite, and Yaazanyahu son of the Maakhatite,
they and their men."
Ii Kings 25:24,"And Gedalyahu swore to them and to their men;
he said to them:
Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans;
stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you!"
Ii Kings 25:25,"But it was in the seventh month
that Yishmael son of Netanya son of Elishama, one of the royal seed, and ten men with him, came
and struck down Gedalyahu, so that he died,
along with the Judeans and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mitzpa."
Ii Kings 25:26,"Then all the people, great and small, and the commanders of the soldiers, arose and went to Egypt,
for they were afraid of the Chaldeans."
Ii Kings 25:27,"Now it was in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Yehoyakhin king of Judah,
in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh of the month,
that Ehvil-Merodakh, king of Babylon, in the year of his becoming king, lifted up the head of Yehoyakhin king of Judah, from the prison house."
Ii Kings 25:28,"He spoke kind-words with him
and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon."
Ii Kings 25:29,"So he changed his prison garments
and ate food regularly before him,
all the days of his life;"
Ii Kings 25:30,"his allowance, a regular allowance, was given to him by the king, each day’s amount in its day,
all the days of his life."
