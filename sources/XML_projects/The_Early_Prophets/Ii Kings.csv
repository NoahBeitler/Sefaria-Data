Ii Kings 1:1,And Moav rebelled against Israel after the death of Ah’av.
Ii Kings 1:2,"Now Ahazya fell through the lattice of his upper-chamber that was in Shomeron,
and he became sick [from his injuries].
So he sent messengers, and said to them:
Go, inquire of Baal Zevuv/Master of Flies, the god of Ekron,
whether I will live through this sickness!"
Ii Kings 1:3,"Now a messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Eliyya the Tishbite:
Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Shomeron,
and speak to them:
Is it because there is no God in Israel
[that all of] you go to inquire of Baal Zevuv, the god of Ekron?"
Ii Kings 1:4,"So therefore, thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
The bed into which you climbed up,
you will not come down from it,
but you will die, yes, die!
And Eliyya went off."
Ii Kings 1:5,"The messengers returned to him, and he said to them:
Now why have you returned?"
Ii Kings 1:6,"They said to him:
A man came up to meet us,
and he said to us:
Go, return to the king who sent you,
and speak to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Is it because there is no God in Israel
[that] you send to inquire of Baal Zevuv, the god of Ekron?
Therefore,
the bed into which you climbed up,
you will not come down from it,
but you will die, yes, die!"
Ii Kings 1:7,"He spoke to them:
What is the manner of the man who came up to meet you
and spoke these words to you?"
Ii Kings 1:8,"They said to him:
A hairy man,
with a girded-belt of leather girded about his loins.
He said:
It is Eliyya the Tishbite!"
Ii Kings 1:9,"So he sent to him a captain of fifty, with his [unit of] fifty.
He went up to him,
and here, he was sitting on top of a hill;
and he spoke to him:
O man of God, the king has spoken:
Come down!"
Ii Kings 1:10,"Eliyyahu answered
and spoke to the captain of fifty:
Now if I am a man of God,
let fire come down from the heavens
and consume you and your fifty!
And fire came down from the heavens
and consumed him and his fifty."
Ii Kings 1:11,"He sent again to him—another captain of fifty and his fifty;
he went up and spoke to him:
O man of God,
thus says the king:
Come down quickly!"
Ii Kings 1:12,"Eliyya answered and spoke to them:
If I am a man of God,
let fire come down from the heavens
and consume you and your fifty!
And fire of God came down from the heavens
and consumed him and his fifty."
Ii Kings 1:13,"He sent again—a third captain of fifty and his fifty;
he went up and came, the third captain of fifty,
but he bowed on his knees in front of Eliyyahu
and pleaded with him
and spoke to him:
O man of God, now may my life and the life of these your fifty servants be precious in your eyes!"
Ii Kings 1:14,"[For] here, fire came down from the heavens
and consumed the previous captains of fifty and their fifties;
but now, may my life be precious in your eyes!"
Ii Kings 1:15,"Then a messenger of God spoke to Eliyyahu:
Go down with him; do not be afraid before him.
So he arose and went down with him to the king."
Ii Kings 1:16,"And he spoke to him:
Thus says Y<small>HWH:</small>
Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zevuv, the God of Ekron,
—Is it because there is no God in Israel whose word can be inquired of?—
therefore,
the bed into which you climbed up,
you will not come down from it,
but you will die, yes, die!"
Ii Kings 1:17,"And he died, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> that Eliyyahu had spoken,
and Yehoram reigned as king in his place,
in year two of Yehoram son of Yehoshafat, king of Judah,
for he had no son."
Ii Kings 1:18,"Now the rest of the events of Ahazyahu, [and] what he did—
are they not written in the Record of Yearly Events of the Kings of Israel?"
Ii Kings 2:1,"Now it was,
when Y<small>HWH</small> was about to bring up Eliyyahu in a storm to the heavens,
that Eliyyahu went with Elisha from Gilgal."
Ii Kings 2:2,"And Eliyyahu said to Elisha:
Pray stay here,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has sent me as far as Bet-El.
Elisha said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your own life, if I should leave you … !
So they went down to Bet-El."
Ii Kings 2:3,"And the Sons of the Prophets who were in Bet-El came out to Elisha
and said to him:
Do you know
that today Y<small>HWH</small> is going to take your lord from your head?
He said:
Certainly I know; be silent!"
Ii Kings 2:4,"Eliyyahu said to him:
Elisha, pray stay here,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has sent me to Jericho.
But he said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your own life, if I should leave you … !
So they came to Jericho."
Ii Kings 2:5,"And the Sons of the Prophets who were in Jericho came close to Elisha
and said to him:
Do you know
that today Y<small>HWH</small> is going to take your lord from your head?
He said:
Certainly I know; be silent!"
Ii Kings 2:6,"Then Eliyyahu said to him:
Pray stay here,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has sent me to the Jordan.
But he said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> and by your own life, if I should leave you … !
Thus the two of them walked on."
Ii Kings 2:7,"Now fifty men of the Sons of the Prophets went
and stood opposite, at a distance,
while the two of them stood by the Jordan."
Ii Kings 2:8,"And Eliyyahu took his mantle, folded it up, and struck the waters,
and they split in half, to here and to there,
and the two of them crossed over on dry-ground."
Ii Kings 2:9,"It was when they crossed that Eliyyahu said to Elisha:
Make-request: what may I do for you before I am taken from beside you?
Elisha said:
Pray let a twofold measure of your spirit be upon me!"
Ii Kings 2:10,"He said:
You have made a difficult request.
If you see me being taken from you, it will be thus for you,
but if not, it will not be."
Ii Kings 2:11,"And it was, as they were walking, walking along and speaking,
that here, a chariot of fire and horses of fire:
they parted the two of them,
and Eliyyahu went up in the storm to the heavens."
Ii Kings 2:12,"When Elisha saw [it],
he kept crying out: Father! Father!
Israel’s chariotry and its horsemen!
But he saw him no more.
So he took hold of his garments and tore them into two torn-pieces,"
Ii Kings 2:13,"and picked up the mantle of Eliyyahu that had fallen from him;
then he returned and stood at the bank of the Jordan."
Ii Kings 2:14,"And he took the mantle of Eliyyahu that had fallen from him
and struck the waters,
and said:
Where is Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Eliyyahu, indeed?
He struck the waters
and they split in half, to here and to there,
and Elisha crossed over."
Ii Kings 2:15,"And the Sons of the Prophets who were in Jericho saw him opposite;
they said:
The spirit of Eliyyahu has come to rest upon Elisha!
They came to meet him and bowed low before him to the ground,"
Ii Kings 2:16,"and they said to him:
Now here, there are fifty men among your servants, valiant ones;
pray let them go and seek your lord,
lest the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> has carried him off
and has thrown him onto one of the mountains or into one of the valleys!
But he said:
You are not to send!"
Ii Kings 2:17,"But they pressed him until he was ashamed,
so he said: Send.
They sent fifty men
and searched for three days,
but they did not find him."
Ii Kings 2:18,"They returned to him
—he was staying in Jericho—
and he said to them:
Did I not say to you: Do not go?"
Ii Kings 2:19,"The men of the town said to Elisha:
Now here, the site of the town is good, as my lord can see,
but the water is bad, and the land causes miscarrying!"
Ii Kings 2:20,"He said:
Fetch me a new bowl and put salt there.
They fetched [it] for him."
Ii Kings 2:21,"He went out to the outflow of the waters
and threw salt in it,
and he said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
I have healed these waters;
there will no longer be death and miscarrying from there!"
Ii Kings 2:22,"And the waters were healed, until this very day,
in accordance with the word of Elisha which he had spoken."
Ii Kings 2:23,"He went up from there to Bet-El.
And as he was going up on the road, some young lads went up out of the town;
they jeered at him and said to him:
Go up, baldhead! Go up, baldhead!"
Ii Kings 2:24,"He faced about behind him and saw them
and cursed them in the name of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and two she-bears came out of the forest
and ripped up forty-two youngsters from them."
Ii Kings 2:25,"He went from there to Mount Carmel,
and from there he returned to Shomeron."
Ii Kings 3:1,"Now Yehoram son of Ah’av became king over Israel in Shomeron
in year eighteen of Yehoshafat king of Judah;
he reigned as king for twelve years."
Ii Kings 3:2,"And he did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
although not like his father or like his mother:
he removed the standing-stone of Baal that his father had made"
Ii Kings 3:3,"—although he clung to the sins of Yorov’am son of Nevat, who had caused Israel to sin,
and did not turn aside from them."
Ii Kings 3:4,"Now Mesha king of Moav was a sheep-dealer;
he would supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand he-lambs and a hundred thousand rams in wool."
Ii Kings 3:5,"But it was, at the death of Ah’av,
that the king of Moav rebelled against the king of Israel."
Ii Kings 3:6,"And King Yehoram went out on that very day from Shomeron
and counted all Israel [for war];"
Ii Kings 3:7,"he went and sent to Yehoshafat king of Judah, saying:
The king of Moav has rebelled against me.
Will you go with me to Moav in battle?
He said:
I will go up!
[For] I am as you are:
my people as your people,
my horses as your horses!"
Ii Kings 3:8,"He said:
By which road shall we go up?
He said:
The Road of the Wilderness of Edom."
Ii Kings 3:9,"So they went, the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom;
they [traveled] round about the road for seven days.
Now there was no water for the camp or for the animals that were behind them,"
Ii Kings 3:10,"so the king of Israel said:
Alas,
for Y<small>HWH</small> must have called these three kings together
to give them into the hand of Moav!"
Ii Kings 3:11,"Yehoshafat said:
Is there no prophet of Y<small>HWH</small> here
that we may inquire of Y<small>HWH</small> through him?
One of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said:
Here is Elisha son of Shafat,
who poured water over the hands of Eliyyahu."
Ii Kings 3:12,"Yehoshafat said:
With him is the word of Y<small>HWH</small>!
And so they went down to him,
the king of Israel, and Yehoshafat, and the king of Edom."
Ii Kings 3:13,"Elisha said to the king of Israel:
What have I to do with you?
Go to your father’s prophets and to your mother’s prophets!
The king of Israel said to him:
No—
for Y<small>HWH</small> has called these three kings together
to give them into the hand of Moav!"
Ii Kings 3:14,"Elisha said:
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small> of the Forces-On-High, in whose presence I stand,
indeed: were it not that I hold up the face of Yehoshafat king of Judah [in respect],
I would not look at you, I would not see you!"
Ii Kings 3:15,"So-now, fetch me a [lyre] strummer!
For it was, when the strummer strummed,
that the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> would [come] upon him—"
Ii Kings 3:16,"and he said:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
This wadi will produce ditches upon ditches,"
Ii Kings 3:17,"for thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
You will not see wind, you will not see showers,
yet that wadi will be filled with water,
and you and your cattle and your animals will drink!"
Ii Kings 3:18,"And this is [but] a light matter in Y<small>HWH</small>’s eyes;
he will give Moav into your hand."
Ii Kings 3:19,"You will strike every fortified town and every choice town,
every good tree you will fell,
and every spring of water you will stop up,
and every good plot-of-land you will mar with stones!"
Ii Kings 3:20,"It was at daybreak, at about the [time of] offering up the grain-gift,
that here, water was coming from the direction of Edom,
and the land filled up with water."
Ii Kings 3:21,"Now all Moav had heard
that the kings were coming up to do battle against them,
and they were summoned,
from all those belting on a sword-belt and upward,
and they stood at the border."
Ii Kings 3:22,"They started early in the morning,
when the sun rose over the water,
and Moav saw, from a distance, water red as blood."
Ii Kings 3:23,"So they said:
This is blood!—
the kings have been put-to-the-sword, yes, the sword,
each one has struck down his fellow!
So-now, to the spoils, O Moav!"
Ii Kings 3:24,"They came to the camp of Israel,
but Israel arose and struck Moav, so that they fled before them;
they came against it, to strike down Moav:"
Ii Kings 3:25,"the towns they wrecked,
and into every good plot-of-land each one threw his stone, and filled it up,
while every source of water they stopped up
and every good tree they felled,
until [only] its stones in Kir-Hareset were left—
but the slingers surrounded [it] and struck it down."
Ii Kings 3:26,"And the king of Moav saw that the battle was too strong for him,
so he took with him seven hundred men drawing the sword,
to break through to the king of Edom,
but they could not prevail."
Ii Kings 3:27,"So he took his firstborn son, who was to become king in his place,
and offered him up as an offering-up on the wall.
And a great wrath was upon Israel,
so that they had to march away from him and return to the land."
Ii Kings 4:1,"Now a woman from the wives of the Sons of the Prophets cried out to Elisha, saying:
Your servant, my husband, is dead.
You yourself know
that your servant held Y<small>HWH</small> in awe.
But a creditor has come to take away my two children as slaves for himself!"
Ii Kings 4:2,"Elisha said to her:
What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?
She said:
Your handmaid has nothing at all in the house
except for a cruse of oil."
Ii Kings 4:3,"He said:
Go, borrow vessels for yourself from outside, from all your neighbors, empty vessels
—do not skimp—"
Ii Kings 4:4,"and come in, close the door behind you and behind your children,
and pour [oil] into all these vessels,
while the full ones set aside."
Ii Kings 4:5,"So she went from him and closed the door behind her and behind her sons;
as they were bringing them to her, she kept on pouring."
Ii Kings 4:6,"And it was, when the vessels were filled up, that she said to her son:
Bring me another vessel.
He said:
There is no other vessel!
And the oil stopped."
Ii Kings 4:7,"Then she came and told the man of God.
He said:
Go, sell the oil
and pay off your debt;
you and your children will live on the rest."
Ii Kings 4:8,"Now it was, one day, that Elisha traveled to Shunem.
There was a prominent woman there,
and she urged him strongly to eat food [with her].
So it would be, whenever he traveled by, he would turn aside there to eat food."
Ii Kings 4:9,"She said to her husband:
Now here, you know
that he is a holy man of God,
passing by us regularly."
Ii Kings 4:10,"Now let us make him a little walled upper-chamber
and let us put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp there for him,
so that it may be, whenever he comes to us, he may turn aside there."
Ii Kings 4:11,"And it was one day that he came there,
and he turned aside to the upper-chamber and lay down there."
Ii Kings 4:12,"He said to Gehazi his serving-lad:
Call this Shunammite!
He called her, and she stood before him."
Ii Kings 4:13,"He said to him:
Now say to her:
Here, you have taken the trouble for us, all this trouble;
what can be done for you?
Might you be spoken about to the king, or to the commander of the armed-forces?
She said:
Among my own kinspeople I reside."
Ii Kings 4:14,"He said:
So what can be done for her?
Gehazi said:
Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."
Ii Kings 4:15,"He said:
Call her.
And he called her, and she stood in the entrance."
Ii Kings 4:16,"Then he said:
At this set season, when time revives,
you will embrace a son!
She said:
Do not, my lord, O man of God,
do not lie to your handmaid!"
Ii Kings 4:17,"But the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son,
at that set season, when time revived,
as Elisha had spoken to her."
Ii Kings 4:18,"And the boy grew.
Now it was one day, that he went out to his father, to the reapers,"
Ii Kings 4:19,"and he said to his father: My head, my head!
He said to a serving-lad:
Carry him to his mother!"
Ii Kings 4:20,"So he carried him and brought him to his mother;
he sat on her knees until noon,
and then he died."
Ii Kings 4:21,"She went up and lay him down upon the bed of the man of God,
closed [the door] on him, and went out."
Ii Kings 4:22,"Then she called to her husband and said:
Now send me one of the lads and one of the she-asses,
that I may run out to the man of God and then return."
Ii Kings 4:23,"He said:
For-what-reason must you be going to him today?
It is not New-Moon, it is not the Sabbath.
She said:
[All] is well."
Ii Kings 4:24,"But she saddled the she-ass and said to her serving-lad:
Lead and go,
do not stop me from riding unless I say [so] to you."
Ii Kings 4:25,"So she went
and came to the man of God, to Mount Carmel.
It was, when the man of God saw her at a distance,
that he said to Gehazi his serving-lad:
Here is that Shunammite."
Ii Kings 4:26,"So-now, pray run to meet her and say to her:
Is it well with you?
Is it well with your husband?
Is it well with the child?
She said: It is well."
Ii Kings 4:27,"She came to the man of God, to the mountain,
and she took hold of him by the feet;
Gehazi approached to push her away,
but the man of God said:
Leave her be, for her feelings are bitter within her,
yet Y<small>HWH</small> has concealed it from me and has not told me."
Ii Kings 4:28,"She said:
Did I request a son from my lord?
Did I not say: Do not set me [too much] at ease?"
Ii Kings 4:29,"He said to Gehazi:
Gird up your loins,
take my rod in your hand, and go.
If you encounter a man, you are not to bless him [in greeting];
you are to answer no man,
and if any man blesses you [in greeting],
you are not to answer him.
But put my rod on the face of the lad."
Ii Kings 4:30,"The mother of the lad said:
As Y<small>HWH</small> lives and as you live, if I should leave you … !
He arose and went after her."
Ii Kings 4:31,"Meanwhile Gehazi crossed over ahead of them and put the rod on the face of the lad,
but there was no sound and no attention,
so she returned to meet him and said to him, saying:
The lad did not wake up!"
Ii Kings 4:32,"Elisha came into the house,
and here, the lad was dead, lying on his bed."
Ii Kings 4:33,"He came in and closed the door behind the two of them
and prayed to Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Ii Kings 4:34,"then he climbed up and lay down atop the child;
he put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his palms on his palms,
and bent over him,
and the flesh of the child became warm."
Ii Kings 4:35,"He turned away and went through the house, once here and once there,
then he climbed up and bent over him;
the lad sneezed seven times
and the lad opened his eyes!"
Ii Kings 4:36,"He called Gehazi and said:
Call this Shunammite!
He called her and she came to him,
and he said:
Lift up your son!"
Ii Kings 4:37,"She came and flung herself at his feet, and bowed low to the ground;
then she lifted up her son and went out."
Ii Kings 4:38,"When Elisha returned to Gilgal,
there was famine in the land.
Now the Sons of the Prophets were sitting before him.
And he said to his serving-lad:
Set on the large pot,
and cook stew for the Sons of the Prophets."
Ii Kings 4:39,"One [of them] went out into the field to gather herbs,
and he came across a field vine
and gathered field gourds from it, [enough] to fill his garment.
Then he came back and split them into the pot of stew,
for he did not know [what they were]."
Ii Kings 4:40,"Now they were poured out for the men to eat,
but it was, just as they ate them from the stew,
that they cried out and said:
There is death in the pot, O man of God!
and they could not eat it."
Ii Kings 4:41,"He said:
Then fetch some meal! …
And he threw it into the pot
and said:
Pour some for the people, so that they may eat!
And then there was nothing evil in the pot."
Ii Kings 4:42,"A man came from Baal Shalisha;
he brought to the man of God bread of the firstfruits:
twenty bread-loaves of barley and ears of fresh grain.
And he said:
Give some to the people, that they may eat!"
Ii Kings 4:43,"His attendant said:
How can I give this before a hundred persons?
He said:
Give some to the people, so that they may eat!
For thus says Y<small>HWH</small>:
They will eat and have some left over."
Ii Kings 4:44,"So he gave it before them and they ate, and they had some left over, in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small>."
