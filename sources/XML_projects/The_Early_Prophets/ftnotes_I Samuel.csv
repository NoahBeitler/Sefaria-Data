I Samuel 1:1,"<b>Ramatayim:</b> Possibly Rama (“Height”), a location frequently associated with Shemuel in the text; it was north of Jerusalem, near the border of what became Israel, the Northern Kingdom. <b>Tzofim:</b> “Watchmen,” but McCarter (1980), following Driver, judges the text corrupt here, and posits “a Tzufite,” after Elkana’s ancestor later in the verse, <b>the highlands of Efrayim:</b> The geographical backbone of what became the Northern Kingdom. <b>Elkana:</b> The name means “God Acquires/Creates.” His son Shemuel will not grow up with his parents, perhaps hinted at here."
I Samuel 1:2,<b>Hanna:</b> Pronounced <i>hahn-NAH;</i> trad. English “Hannah.” <b>Peninna:</b> Pronounced <i>pe-nin-NAH;</i> trad. English “Peninnah.”
I Samuel 1:3,"<b>from year to year</b> (see also v.7, “year after year”): This phrase had occurred in the last chapter of Judges; such links between adjacent texts occur from time to time in the Bible, <b>bow down:</b> This posture of worship, also used in approaching a superior, is on the knees, usually with “nostrils to the earth.” Y<small>HWH</small>: As explained above in “On Using This Book,” the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, whose pronunciation is not precisely known, is traditionally transcribed as “the Lord” and the like. Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it (for example, “The Eternal” or <i>“Ado-nai</i>”). Y<small>HWH</small> <b>of the Forces-On-High:</b> In <i>The Early Prophets</i> this title has a military ring; <i>tzeva’ot</i> may also refer to the concept of a heavenly council of gods from earlier mythological traditions. <b>Shilo:</b> Pronounced <i>shee-LO;</i> trad. English “Shiloh,” one of the important pre-Jerusalem shrines, situated in the highlands of Efrayim. <b>Hofni … Pin’has:</b> Pronounced <i>hof-NEE</i> and <i>pin-HASS.</i> Like a number of early Israelite priestly names, these are Egyptian in origin. Pin’has is trad. English “Phineas” and means “dark-skinned.”"
I Samuel 1:4,"<b>… and she wept … :</b> The narrative picks up from v.4, on a day that Elkana was offering sacrifices; everything in between is the background to Hanna’s weeping."
I Samuel 1:5,"<b>better … than ten sons:</b> As Alter (1999) points out, Elkana’s question is both empathetic and off the mark; how could he understand a barren mother’s feelings?"
I Samuel 1:6,"<b>Eli:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-LEE.</i> <b>throne:</b> Unlike in modern usage, Heb. <i>kissei</i> tends to mean more than a simple “chair” in the Bible. <b>great-hall:</b> Used here to denote the sanctuary."
I Samuel 1:7,"<b>see:</b> The preposition used with the Hebrew verb adds an element of feeling, connoting “look sympathetically.” <b>your maidservant:</b> Referring to oneself in the third person is used in the Bible when one addresses a superior. <b>I will give him to Y<small>HWH</small> … no razor:</b> Hanna here alludes to the Nazirite laws of Num. 6, where in fulfillment of a religious vow, a person would not shave (there are additional provisions and prohibitions). Shemuel, like Shimshon (Judg. 13–16) before him, appears to be Nazirite for life, a concept not found in the Numbers text."
I Samuel 1:8,<b>in the presence of</b> Y<small>HWH</small>: This phrase usually indicates a sacred location or building.
I Samuel 1:9,"<b>took her for a drunkard:</b> Praying, as well as reading and writing, was not a silent activity in the ancient world, hence Eli’s mistaken assessment of Hanna."
I Samuel 1:10,"<b>pouring out my soul:</b> An extremely strong expression; usually in the Bible, the objects of pouring are blood or anger. Here it is also a nice play on imagery, since Hanna has just rightly denied that she has been drinking. Generally I avoid “soul” for Heb. <i>nefesh,</i> which in the Bible does not mean the opposite of “body,” but here, the English has the connotation of “feelings.”"
I Samuel 1:11,"<b>the turning of days:</b> Or “the turning of the year,” namely, a year later. <b>Shemuel:</b> Pronounced <i>sheh-moo-AYL;</i> trad. English “Samuel.” <b>requested:</b> As noted in the Commentary, this verb, <i>sh-’-l,</i> is really associated with the name of Sha’ul (Saul) (see v.28, where “lent-on-request” is vocalized <i>sha’ul</i>)."
I Samuel 1:12,"<b>forever:</b> Permanently, as per her promise in v.11. <b>weaned:</b> Probably around the age of three."
I Samuel 1:13,"<b>three-year-old bull:</b> Following LXX; MT (the standard Hebrew text) has “bulls, three.” <b><i>efa:</i></b> Pronounced <i>ay-FAH.</i> It was a dry measure, perhaps fifteen liters. <b>though the lad was [just] a lad:</b> The Hebrew is strange here; one manuscript of LXX suggests a longer text, describing the family’s pilgrimage."
I Samuel 1:14,<b>lend-him-on-request:</b> Since Heb. <i>sh-’-l</i> can also mean “lend.” <b>they:</b> So ancient versions; MT has “he.”
I Samuel 2:1,<b>my horn is raised:</b> See also <small>V.10.</small> McCarter (1980) notes that “the exalted horn is … a visible sign of success.” See also the use of the image in Bil’am’s blessings in Num. 23:22.
I Samuel 2:2,"<b>rock:</b> Rocks and stones appear frequently in the Bible as symbols of solidity and permanence—for instance, as monuments—and are thus appropriate images for God’s dependability."
I Samuel 2:3,"<b>endure:</b> LXX; MT has “cease.” <b>seven:</b> The number of wholeness or perfection, in the Bible and elsewhere in the ancient Near East."
I Samuel 2:4,"<b>Sheol:</b> Pronounced <i>sheh-OHL.</i> The biblical underworld. Unlike the later concepts of heaven and hell, it appears to be simply a subdued place where the dead rest (see Chap. 28 below), similar to the Greek Hades."
I Samuel 2:5,<b>destitute … dunghill:</b> The Hebrew is not alliterative. <b>world:</b> Or “mainland.”
I Samuel 2:6,"<b>moan:</b> See Levine; <i>d-m-m</i> sometimes has this meaning, as opposed to the traditional “are silent.”"
I Samuel 2:7,<b>king:</b> An anachronism which nicely foreshadows the major concern of the book. <b>anointed one:</b> A synonym for “king”; the verb refers to the practice of consecrating a ruler by pouring oil on his head.
I Samuel 2:8,"<b>base fellows:</b> It is difficult to find an appropriate modern English translation for the phrase; “ne’er-do-wells,” “lowlifes,” or “scoundrels” are older equivalents. Some later scholars have translated the term <i>beliyaal</i> as a devil figure, “Belial.” <b>know:</b> In a deep sense. In solely human contexts, it can refer to sexual relations."
I Samuel 2:9,"<b>fork:</b> Others, “flesh hook.”"
I Samuel 2:10,<b>and would strike … :</b> He would plunge the fork into the vat.
I Samuel 2:11,"<b>not … boiled flesh … only raw:</b> By not burning away the fat first, as was the ritual requirement, the lads were committing an act of sacrilege (see Lev. 3:16–17)."
I Samuel 2:12,"<b><i>efod:</i></b> Pronounced <i>ay-FODE,</i> an apron-like priestly garment which covered the torso, described in Exod. 28:6ff."
I Samuel 2:13,"<b>cloak:</b> Shemuel’s adult cloak will play an important role in his relationship with Sha’ul, the king whom he will later anoint."
I Samuel 2:14,<b>their:</b> So ancient versions; MT has “his.”
I Samuel 2:15,"<b>Indeed:</b> 4QS<sup>a</sup> has, more likely, “And.” <b>took account:</b> The same expression is used regarding the previously barren Sara in Gen. :1. <b>in the presence of:</b> Reading <i>lifnei, as</i> in 4QS<sup>a</sup> and LXX, in place of MT’s ’<i>im</i>, “with.”"
I Samuel 2:16,"<b>to all Israel:</b> Thus stressing the serious nature of their offenses. <b>they were lying with the women:</b> Alter notes the appetite parallels between food and sex which are roundly condemned in this chapter. <b>acting-as-a-workforce:</b> That is, serving at various tasks at the sanctuary. <b>Tent of Appointment:</b> A pre-Temple sanctuary, identified here with the one the Israelites carried around in the wilderness after the Exodus."
I Samuel 2:17,"Y<small>HWH</small> <b>desired to have them die:</b> Here, as elsewhere, the book is moving toward the establishment of the monarchy, so Eli’s sons have to be removed from the picture."
I Samuel 2:18,"<b>Father’s House:</b> A social unit smaller than a tribe, similar to an extended family."
I Samuel 2:19,"<b>kicked away … :</b> The entire passage is unclear, especially the two occurrences of Heb. <i>ma’on</i> (“habitation,” here and v.32), which, following others, I have emended to <i>’ayin,</i> “eye.” <b>premier-part:</b> The portion of the sacrifices intended for God."
I Samuel 2:20,"<b>Therefore, the Utterance:</b> The usual introductory formula when a prophet speaks in the name of God."
I Samuel 2:21,"<b>hew off your arm:</b> The idiom perhaps refers to disabling one’s capacity to shoot an arrow.
32–33 <b>you will look … :</b> The text is unclear and difficult to reconstruct."
I Samuel 2:22,"<b>a trusted priest:</b> Many scholars such as McCarter (1980) identify him as Tzadok, founder of the dominant priestly line in Jerusalem under David, <b>trust-worthy:</b> Or “secure” (see II Sam. 7:6). <b>my anointed one:</b> Once again referring to the future king."
I Samuel 2:23,"<b>[for me] … :</b> Namely, the priests will be desperate for food."
I Samuel 3:1,
I Samuel 3:2,
I Samuel 3:3,"<b>Coffer:</b> Others, “Ark”; this was Israel’s most sacred cultic object, the chest in which the tablets of the Ten Commandments were kept in the center of the Tabernacle."
I Samuel 3:4,"<b>return, lie down:</b> Or “lie down again.”"
I Samuel 3:5,"<b>and stood [there]:</b> This very human description of God made later readers somewhat uncomfortable, but a physical presence of God is alluded to a number of times in biblical texts (see Gen. 3 and Exod. 33 for examples). <b>Shemuel! Shemuel!:</b> Such doubling occasionally occurs at an important biographical moment in the text (see Gen. 22:11 and Exod. 3:4)."
I Samuel 3:6,<b>ring:</b> The customary “tingle” hardly seems adequate to describe a reaction of horror.
I Samuel 3:7,<b>all that I spoke:</b> See vv.30–36 above.
I Samuel 3:8,"<b>God:</b> Following LXX; MT has “them” (Heb. <i>lhm,</i> as opposed to <i>’lhym).</i> <b>condemn:</b> The same word in v.2 (“be dim”) refers to Eli’s failing eyesight; its use points to Eli’s “lack of insight” (Polzin 1989)."
I Samuel 3:9,"<b>Should … :</b> Namely, the iniquity will <i>not</i> be purged away."
I Samuel 3:10,<b>Thus may God do to you … :</b> Shemuel will be punished if he does not reveal the results of his encounter with God.
I Samuel 3:11,"<b>He is Y<small>HWH</small> … :</b> Eli humbly accepts God’s judgment, despite the horrific consequences for him personally."
I Samuel 3:12,"<b>from Dan to Be’er-Sheva:</b> From one end of the country to the other, north to south."
I Samuel 4:1,"<b>Afek:</b> The Philistine border, northeast of Joppa, and a starting point for their campaigns northward."
I Samuel 4:2,"<b>defeated:</b> Or, more literally, “beaten.” <b>grasp: Lit.,</b> “palm,” often used in Samuel in place of “hand.”"
I Samuel 4:3,"<b>[The One] Seated on the Winged-Sphinxes:</b> The Coffer serves as God’s footstool, an image found elsewhere in the ancient Near East. The “winged-sphinxes” (Heb. <i>keruvim</i>), mythical guardians of ancient Near Eastern palaces and temples, should not be confused with the later image of “cherubim,” the naked, chubby little angels of Western art."
I Samuel 4:4,<b>Hebrews:</b> A term used in the Bible when foreigners are talking about the Israelites; see the early chapters of Exodus.
I Samuel 4:5,"<b>yesterday [and] the day-before:</b> A biblical idiom for “in the past,” “recently.”"
I Samuel 4:6,"<b>This is the god … :</b> The Bible likes to portray non-Israelites’ awe and terror of Y<small>HWH</small>. <b>blow:</b> Lit., “stroke.”"
I Samuel 4:7,"<b>thirty thousand:</b> Like many ancient troop and casualty numbers, this figure is certainly exaggerated."
I Samuel 4:8,"<b>Binyaminite:</b> The tribe of Binyamin’s territory was in the center of the country, <b>his garb torn and earth on his head:</b> Standard signs of mourning in ancient Israel."
I Samuel 4:9,"<b>ninety-eight:</b> As with many other biblical numbers, this one fits a “perfect” pattern, as a (double!) multiple of seven. <b>set:</b> McCarter (1980) uses “fixed.”"
I Samuel 4:10,"<b>he fell:</b> Eli. <b>heavy:</b> Heb. <i>kaved</i>, punning with the important term <i>kavod</i> (“glory”) used both earlier (2:30) and later in the narrative (Auld 2011). <b>led Israel as judge:</b> As in the book of Judges, such a person has functions beyond court procedure (especially, and often, military leadership), <b>forty:</b> Another special number, familiar from the Flood and Sinai stories, and likewise used in Judges."
I Samuel 4:11,<b>I-Khavod:</b> The “I” is pronounced as “ee.” Trad. English “Ichabod.”
I Samuel 5:1,"<b>Ashdod:</b> One of the five chief Philistines cities, the others being Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and Gat. All are on or near the Mediterranean coast."
I Samuel 5:2,"<b>Dagon:</b> Pronounced <i>dah-GOHN,</i> a long-revered fertility god of the ancient Near East, here connected with the Philistines. While no material evidence of his worship among them has been found, the Philistines are known to have adapted quickly to local cultures."
I Samuel 5:3,"<b>fallen down on his face:</b> In an obvious posture of submission, <b>head and … palms … cut off:</b> A known treatment of those defeated in war; see I Sam. 31:9–10, below, and the fate of the notorious Jezebel in II Kings 9:35."
I Samuel 5:4,"<b>Therefore the priests … :</b> Like many biblical stories, this one has an etiological function, attempting to explain an old custom or name."
I Samuel 5:5,"<b>devastated:</b> Some emend Heb. <i>sh-m-m</i> to <i>h-m-m,</i> “panicked,” a key word in Chaps. <b>4–5. tumors:</b> The written text has the nastier “hemorrhoids” (<i>tehorim</i>); scribal tradition has substituted the present “tumors” (<i>’ofalim</i>). These, and the mice-related plague (see :4), are viewed as a further divine curse on the Philistines for their possession of the Coffer. See Alter (1999) for a discussion of the long-standing confusion in the text; he cites an old interpretation that the passage actually refers to the bubonic plague."
I Samuel 5:6,"<b>overlords:</b> Heb. <i>seranim,</i> related to the English word “tyrants” through Greek."
I Samuel 6:1,<b>for seven months:</b> LXX adds “and mice invaded their fields.” The Hebrew text is somewhat defective in this whole story of the plague.
I Samuel 6:2,"<b>reparation-offering:</b> Heb. <i>asham,</i> a biblical sacrifice, explained in Lev. 5 as financial restitution for wrong-doing, including unintentional actions."
I Samuel 6:3,"<b>he dealt wantonly with them:</b> Referring to God, who treated Egypt thus in Exod. 10:2. The verb can also mean “abused.”"
I Samuel 6:4,"<b>new wagon:</b> New since it is to be used for sacred purposes, <b>not yet yielded to a yoke:</b> The alliteration (Heb. <i>lo ’ala ’alehem ’ol)</i> highlights the importance of the idea: animals in the Israelite cultic system (see Num. 19:2) must be perfect, untainted by secular use (exactly like the wagon above)."
I Samuel 6:5,<b>pouch:</b> Following McCarter (190).
I Samuel 6:6,"<b>Bet-Shemesh:</b> Just east of the major Philistine cities. <b>he:</b> God. <b>evil:</b> Or “misfortune.”
10, 12 <b>their young they shut up … lowing:</b> As Alter (1999) notes, the cows are forced to pull the Coffer against their natural inclination, which would be to suckle their young. Perhaps this detail underscores the power of the Coffer."
I Samuel 6:7,<b>Gat:</b> Pronounced <i>got;</i> trad. English “Gath.”
I Samuel 6:8,<b>[were by] … :</b> Hebrew syntax difficult.
I Samuel 6:9,"<b>for they had looked:</b> Not only does the harboring of the Coffer do damage to the Philistines, but Israelites as well have to be extremely cautious in its powerful presence."
I Samuel 7:1,"<b>Kiryat-Ye’arim … Giv’a:</b> Moving ever closer to the Jerusalem area. Trad. English for these towns is “Kiriath-Jearim” and “Gibeah.” <b>hallowed:</b> Here connoting “appointed.”
3–4 <b>Astartes:</b> The main goddesses of Canaan, often referred to in the Early Prophets as the objects of the Israelites’ religious backsliding. They may also be terms used to denote local pagan gods in general (McCarter 1980)."
I Samuel 7:2,"<b>Mitzpa:</b> Trad. English “Mizpah,” roughly between Rama and Bet-El—again, a central location in Israel. It was the scene of important tribal assemblies in Judges (see 11:11 and 20:1)."
I Samuel 7:3,"<b>poured it out:</b> Perhaps, since it is accompanied by fasting, this is some kind of purification ceremony (see McCarter 1980). <b>fasted:</b> A common ancient response to national calamity, natural or otherwise."
I Samuel 7:4,"<b>whole-offering:</b> This seems to be an explanation of the preceding “offering-up,” although the two terms are basically synonymous, denoting a sacrifice that is wholly burnt and not eaten by the one who brings it."
I Samuel 7:5,<b>Bet-Kar:</b> Presumably near Mitzpa.
I Samuel 7:6,<b>Amorites:</b> A general name for the indigenous Canaanite population.
I Samuel 7:7,"<b>year after year:</b> This phrase brackets the Samuel story, given its occurrence in 1:3 (Alter 1999). <b>Gilgal:</b> Although several biblical towns bore this name, the one mentioned here probably refers to a major Israelite religious site that was associated with important national events; it lay somewhat northeast of Rama, possibly near Jericho."
I Samuel 8:1,"<b>Now it was …</b>: The opening here is reminiscent of another story regarding continuity, Yaakov’s stealing of the birthright in Gen. 27."
I Samuel 8:2,"<b>Yoel … Aviyya:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-AYL</i> and <i>ah-vee-YAH;</i> trad. English “Joel … Abijah.” The names are ironically pious ones, meaning “Y<small>HWH</small> Is God” and “Father [God] Is Y<small>HWH</small>,” respectively. <b>in Be’er-Sheva:</b> As if Shemuel, realizing their faults, puts considerable distance (fifty miles) between himself and them (Hamilton). Be’er-Sheva is trad. English “Beersheba.”"
I Samuel 8:3,"<b>cast aside cases:</b> Or “swayed decisions, ‘threw’ cases” (Greenstein, written communication).
9, 11 <b>rule:</b> Or “practice.” I have followed Tsevat here in reproducing a pun in the Hebrew, where the stem <i>sh-p-t</i> can refer to both legal decision-making and leadership."
I Samuel 8:4,<b>commanders of thousands … fifties:</b> Military titles which recur throughout the books of Samuel and Kings.
I Samuel 8:5,"<b>servants:</b> Royal functionaries, like vassals (Alter 1999)."
I Samuel 8:6,"<b>tithe:</b> Tax a tenth of its value. I have been careful not to use the idiomatic English “take a tenth,” so as not to muddle the key repetition of “take” in this passage, <b>officers:</b> The term was long translated “eunuchs,” but that meaning is probably not meant literally here."
I Samuel 8:7,"<b>young-men:</b> Changing one letter, LXX reads “cattle.”"
I Samuel 8:8,"<b>battles for us:</b> Lit. “our battles,” but the Hebrew verse has a kind of rhyme which I wanted to echo."
I Samuel 9:1,"<b>a man:</b> Some ancient versions read “a certain man,” paralleling the opening of the book. <b>Kish son of Aviel … :</b> Hamilton points out some similarities between this genealogy and Shemuel’s, as if Sha’ul’s choosing parallels the earlier one of Shemuel; both are requested of God. The pronunciations of names are: <i>keesh … ah-vee-AYL … tze-ROHR … beh-kho-RAHT … ah-fee-AKH.</i> <b>value:</b> Heb. <i>hayil</i> in these books often means “valor,” as a measure of military excellence, but here, as with some other biblical terms for “strength,” it can refer to high economic status as well."
I Samuel 9:2,<b>Sha’ul:</b> Pronounced <i>shah-OOL;</i> trad. English “Saul.” <b>goodly:</b> Or “good-looking.”
I Samuel 9:3,<b>strayed:</b> Or “were lost.”
I Samuel 9:4,<b>Shalisha … Shaalim:</b> The locations are unclear.
I Samuel 9:5,"<b>They had [just] come … when:</b> Alter (1999) notes a similarly worded sequence in vv., 11, 14, and 27, as a series of “coincidences” leading to the commissioning of Sha’ul. <b>Tzuf:</b> Shemuel’s home district. <b>Go, let’s turn back:</b> If Alter (1999) is correct that a biblical character’s first words are an important indication of his character, this is not a good sign."
I Samuel 9:6,"<b>perhaps he can tell us about our</b> way: As indeed he does, though not with the limited perspective that Sha’ul is expecting."
I Samuel 9:7,"<b>we bring:</b> Heb. <i>navi,</i> identical in sound with the word for “prophet.”"
I Samuel 9:8,<b>a quarter weight of silver:</b> Coins were not yet in use throughout much of the biblical period.
I Samuel 9:9,<b>prophet … seer:</b> The early audience of the book would presumably already have been puzzled by the use of the old term “seer” here.
I Samuel 9:10,<b>bared … ear:</b> Probably parallel to the English expression “to bend the ear.”
I Samuel 9:11,"<b><i>Nagid:</i></b> Pronounced <i>nah-GEED;</i> others, “Prince,” but the term does not mean a king’s son. It probably indicates a military leader specially appointed by God, a “designate.” Because of ongoing debate about the term, I have left it in Hebrew. <b>for I have seen … for their cry:</b> Echoing God’s redemptive speech at the Burning Bush (Exod. 3:7). Some render Heb. <i>ki, “for,”</i> as “indeed.”"
I Samuel 9:12,<b>keep rein on:</b> The use of a verb (<i>’-tz-r</i>) that usually means “restrain” is puzzling. Many understand it as something like “govern.”
I Samuel 9:13,"<b>words:</b> Heb. singular. Alternatively, “this matter.”"
I Samuel 9:14,"<b>thigh … fat-tail:</b> Parts of the sacrificial animal that were usually reserved for consumption by the priests. In this chapter, Sha’ul will briefly take on both priestly and prophetic roles. <b>saying: I have invited the people:</b> Or, with JPS, “when I said I was inviting the people.” The Hebrew text appears garbled.
25–26 <b>roof … :</b> The Hebrew is difficult here; once again, a chunk of text appears to be missing."
I Samuel 10:1,<b>his inheritance:</b> The people of Israel.
I Samuel 10:2,"<b>Rahel’s burial-place … Tzeltzah:</b> The location of the traditional tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem, built in medieval times, has long been felt to be incorrectly identified. It most probably stood near Kiryat-Ye’arim, northwest of Jerusalem. Alternatively, <i>Tzeltzah</i> may be some kind of description—“rushing” or “limping”—and not a place name. The ancient versions are confused."
I Samuel 10:3,"<b>garrison:</b> Others, “prefect.” <b>ranting-in-prophecy:</b> The verb “to prophesy,” conventionally thought of as predicting the future but really encompassing speaking the word of God more generally, can also have the earlier meaning of certain forms of ecstatic religious behavior (see Commentary)."
I Samuel 10:4,"<b>rushing-spirit:</b> Heb. <i>ru’ah</i> can mean either “spirit” or “wind,” so the concept might be seen as a spiritual one with physical force."
I Samuel 10:5,"<b>do for yourself whatever … :</b> I.e., follow your impulse, since it’s from God (McCarter 1980)."
I Samuel 10:6,"<b>changed in him another heart:</b> That is, altered his mental and religious state, as if he were another person. This kind of consciousness change is familiar to many cultures and periods down to the present."
I Samuel 10:7,"<b>son of Kish:</b> Referring to a person simply as someone’s son, without the person’s own given name, is considered an insult in the Bible."
I Samuel 10:8,"<b>But who is their father?:</b> A strange question, but in perhaps looking for the prophets’ leader (“father”), the text raises the larger leadership question of the book."
I Samuel 10:9,<b>he did not tell him:</b> The reason is unclear; is it out of modesty or inner uncertainty?
I Samuel 10:10,"<b>Mitzpa:</b> Since this town did not become important until the sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>, it is possible that the material has been reworked (McKenzie 2000)."
I Samuel 10:11,"<b>your trials and your troubles:</b> Heb. <i>ra’otekhem ve-tzarotekhem.</i> <b>station yourselves:</b> I.e., present yourselves."
I Samuel 10:12,"<b>captured-by-lot:</b> As several scholars point out, everywhere else in the Bible this procedure is used to determine the identity of a criminal. The verb (<i>l-k-d</i>) is more commonly used to describe the conquest of territory in the Bible. See also Josh. 7:15–18 and I Sam. 14:41."
I Samuel 10:13,"<b>the gear:</b> Others, “the baggage.” How are we to take the behavior of the king-elect here—as humble, or as something else?"
I Samuel 10:14,"<b>record:</b> Heb. <i>sefer,</i> a written document. It only comes to mean “book” centuries later."
I Samuel 10:15,"<b>he was like one silent:</b> McCarter (1980) emends <i>vayhi ke-maharish</i> to <i>vayhi kemo hodesh</i> (“Now it was about a month later”), thus connecting the phrase to 11:1."
I Samuel 11:1,"<b>Ammonite:</b> The Ammonites occupied the territory east of the Jordan, between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee (biblical Kinneret). <b>Yavesh-Gil’ad:</b> Trad. English “Jabesh Gilead”; on the east bank of the Jordan and so bordering on Ammonite lands. <b>Cut a covenant:</b> Make a treaty; the “cutting” part may refer to an accompanying animal sacrifice (see Gen. 15, and elsewhere in the ancient Near East)."
I Samuel 11:2,<b>On <i>this</i> [condition]:</b> Following Driver.
I Samuel 11:3,"<b>Leave us be:</b> Elsewhere I use “to slack” for Heb. <i>r-p-h,</i> so a colloquial equivalent would be “Cut us some slack.” <b>[to surrender]:</b> Again following Driver."
I Samuel 11:4,"<b>terror of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Parallel to the “panic” so often seen among Israel’s enemies in the Bible, although here it refers to the Israelites themselves (McCarter 1980)."
I Samuel 11:5,"<b>Bezek:</b> On the west bank of the Jordan. <b>three hundred thousand:</b> See note to 4:10, above."
I Samuel 11:6,<b>victory:</b> Or “deliverance.”
I Samuel 11:7,"<b>Gilgal:</b> An important cultic site; in Joshua, the Israelite men had been circumcised there, and the location was also associated with the “Dwelling” (Tabernacle). <b>renew the kingship:</b> Again, some see this piece of text as an alternate account of Sha’ul’s elevation."
I Samuel 12:1,"<b>set-a-king as king:</b> Heb. <i>va-yamlikh … melekh,</i> not an unusual construction in Hebrew."
I Samuel 12:2,"<b>Here I am … :</b> This verse follows a pattern of legal declaration, familiar from several places in Deuteronomy (Fishbane). <b>taken:</b> The key verb from Shemuel’s warning speech in Chap. 8 returns (see Garsiel 1985). <b>crushed:</b> Or “mistreated, oppressed.” <b>ransom:</b> Heb. <i>kofer;</i> a related concept is that of a bribe (Heb. <i>shohad</i>). <b>that I shut my eyes with it:</b> MT is confusing; McCarter (1980), following LXX, emends to “or a pair of shoes? Accuse me”—reflecting Ruth 4:7 and an old custom of circumventing legal conventions. JPS renders the phrase “to look the other way.”"
I Samuel 12:3,<b>Witness!:</b> The verbatim repeating of part of a question is the biblical way to say “yes” (see Greenstein 1989).
I Samuel 12:4,<b>[It is] Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> LXX reads “Y<small>HWH</small> is a witness.”
I Samuel 12:5,<b>Moshe and Aharon:</b> Trad. English “Moses and Aaron.”
I Samuel 12:6,<b>Sisera … Hatzor:</b> See Judg. 4–5. <b>Moav:</b> Trad. English “Moab.”
I Samuel 12:7,"<b>Yerub-baal … :</b> Yerub-baal is Gideon (see Judg. 7:1), while the identity of “Bedan” remains a textual mystery. LXX reads it as “Barak,” from Judg. 4, while Kimhi takes it as an abbreviation for <i>ben Dan,</i> “son of Dan,” namely Shimshon."

I Samuel 12:11,"<b>wheat cutting … thunder-sounds:</b> The wheat harvest typically occurred in late May or early June, so here, in the dry season, there could be no question of naturally occurring rain. <b>know and take note:</b> The use of these two imperative verbs in sequence is peculiar to Samuel, Kings, and Jeremiah. I follow the translation of Cogan (2001) in I Kings."
I Samuel 12:12,"<b>after:</b> Omitting the word “because” which occurs in the Hebrew immediately before this, along with LXX. <b>avail … prevail:</b> Heb. <i>yo’ilu … yatzilu.</i> I normally translate <i>n-tz-l</i> (from which the second verb is derived) as “rescue.” <b>confusion:</b> Heb. <i>tohu,</i> related to the chaos at the beginning of Creation in Gen. 1:2 (where Heb. <i>tohu va-vohu</i> can be rendered “Confusion and Chaos”)."
I Samuel 13:1,"<b>___ years old … ___ years:</b> The MT is missing the first number here, and uses “two years” (of Sha’ul’s reign) for what may have been a more reasonable number. Probably the whole phrase was inserted later to make Sha’ul’s kingship follow the usual Deuteronomistic description, but the specifics were lost or omitted."
I Samuel 13:2,"<b>Mikhmas:</b> Between Mitzpa and Gilgal, hence north of Rama. <b>Bet-El:</b> An important biblical town lying between Shekhem (today’s Nablus) and Jerusalem. <b>Yonatan:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-nah-TAHN;</i> trad.

I Samuel 13:3,"<b>reeks:</b> An oft-used biblical expression to describe odious behavior and hence reputation (see also II Sam. 10:6,16:21)."

I Samuel 14:2,"<b>the Migron:</b> Or “the threshing floor” (McCarter 1980), a place where ancient Near Eastern rulers often sat, near the city gate (see I Kings 22:10). If the name derives from <i>n-g-r,</i> “gush,” it possibly refers to Wadi es-Swenit, not too far from Giv’a; the “Pomegranate” would then be the cave referred to in Judg. 20:45–47 (Arnold/Williamson)."
I Samuel 14:3,<b>while Ahiyya … :</b> Why this detail? See v.18 below.

I Samuel 14:5,"<b>Yehonatan:</b> An alternate spelling of “Yonatan,” with no change in meaning. <b>Foreskinned Ones:</b> The Israelites’ characterization of the Philistines, who were not circumcised. The term was already used in Judges, <b>for there is nothing to constrain … :</b> Namely, God works through the few as well as through the many."
I Samuel 14:6,<b>your heart inclines to:</b> Following LXX; MT has “your heart. Incline …” The idiom itself means “as you desire.”
I Samuel 14:7,"<b>climbed up by his hands and by his feet:</b> Or “by his arms and legs.” <b>dispatched:</b> A slightly different form of the Hebrew root (<i>m-w-t</i>) from which “die” and “put to death” are derived. Others, “deal the death blow.”"

I Samuel 14:9,"<b>the throng was swaying, going and coming back:</b> McCarter (1980): “surging back and forth.”"
I Samuel 14:10,"<b>Coffer:</b> McCarter (1980) argues for LXX’s <i>“efod, ”</i> an object more likely to be used in divination."
I Samuel 14:11,"<b>Withdraw your hand!:</b> Since we can hear the sounds of the enemy’s defeat, there is no longer any need to resort to the <i>efod</i> (Alter 99)."

I Samuel 14:16,"<b>My father has stirred-up-disaster:</b> Alter (1999) notes the parallel with Yiftah (Jephthah), another rash vow-maker (Judg. 11)."
I Samuel 14:17,"<b>ate [them] with the blood:</b> A practice forbidden earlier in the Bible (see Gen. 9:4). In the biblical view, blood belongs to God alone."
I Samuel 14:18,"<b>the first [that he] built:</b> That Sha’ul’s altar building occurs this late in the narrative (he has already been rejected in the previous chapter) may hint at his desperation, or simply be another indication of his fragmented communications with God."
I Samuel 14:19,"<b>draw near:</b> To consult God through an oracle, as in the next verse’s “inquire” (which is built on the same verb, <i>sh-’-l,</i> as Sha’ul’s name)."
I Samuel 14:20,"<b>on that day:</b> Or any other, for that matter."
I Samuel 14:21,<b>“cornerstones”:</b> Nobles; a parallel English idiom might be “pillars [of the community].”
I Samuel 14:22,"Y<small>HWH</small>, <b>the God of Israel:</b> More appropriate as a form of address, as Alter (1999) translates. <b>Give <i>tammim!:</i></b> That is, reveal through the oracle, making use of the objects known as the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tummim</i> (pronounced <i>oo-REEM</i> and <i>too-MEEM;</i> see Exod. 28:30). It is not exactly clear what they were; in any event, some theorize that they gave a “yes or no” answer to the petitioner. Note also that <i>Urim</i> begins with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and <i>Tummim</i> with the last. The LXX gives a longer text at this point, including the <i>Urim</i> in the request. <b>captured-by-lot:</b> See 10:20 and note, above."

I Samuel 14:25,"<b>had captured:</b> The Hebrew verb (<i>l-k-d</i>) is often connected to the casting of lots, as in v.41 above, and also 10:20–21, as well as referring to conquest. <b>Moav … Edom:</b> Pronounced <i>mo-AHV</i> and <i>eh-DOHM.</i> Along with Ammon, these were traditional enemies who were understood in Genesis to come from the same stock as Israel. The Moabites inhabited the region due east of the Dead Sea, with the Edomites occupying the area to the south of that. <b>king:</b> So ancient versions; MT has “kings.” <b>Tzova:</b> The area north of Damascus, <b>was victorious:</b> Reading MT’s <i>yrsh’</i> (“did wrong,” “was blameworthy”), which makes no sense here, as <i>ywsh’,</i> following LXX and other ancient versions."

I Samuel 14:27,"<b>Aviner:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-vee-NAYR.</i> Usually spelled as “Avner” in the text; similar, in II Samuel, are “Aminon/Amnon” and “Avishalom/Avshalom.” The name means “Father [God] Is a Light/Lamp.” He is also, as indicated in the next verse, Sha’ul’s cousin. Trad. English “Abner.”"
I Samuel 14:28,<b>gather him:</b> A term denoting the recruiting of troops.
I Samuel 15:1,
I Samuel 15:2,"<b>what Amalek did:</b> In Exod. 17, the Amalekites, who in Sha’ul’s day inhabited the Negev, attacked the newly freed Israelites in the rear, provoking God to declare a kind of eternal war against them. The later book of Esther’s hero and villain, Mordekhai and Haman, are cast as descendants of Sha’ul and Agag, the Amalekite king here."
I Samuel 15:3,"<b>devote-to-destruction:</b> Some biblical war accounts describe the practice of proscribing the spoils of war—devoting them to God, which could mean confiscation for the sanctuary or, in the case of persons, death. See the famous case of Akhan in Josh. 7."
I Samuel 15:4,"<b>Tela’im:</b> Perhaps Telem in southern Judah, but the spelling here is identical to that of a word for “lambs” (see the language of the previous verse; the word used for lambs in v.9 is, however, different)."
I Samuel 15:5,<b>wadi:</b> A dry riverbed or ravine.
I Samuel 15:6,"<b>Kenites:</b> Another desert tribe, reputed to be descended from Moshe’s father-in-law Yitro (Jethro). They and Amalek are seen as both descended from Esav/Edom. Here the relationship leads to their being spared in the midst of Israel’s taking vengeance. See also Judg. 4."
I Samuel 15:7,<b>Shur:</b> The “wall” that served as the eastern border of Egypt.

I Samuel 15:12,<b><i>terafim:</i></b> Household idols (see Gen. 31:19).
I Samuel 15:13,<b>crossed:</b> Violated.
I Samuel 15:14,"<b>he held:</b> Sha’ul. <b>the corner of his cloak:</b> To hold on to the hem of the royal garment was, in ancient Near Eastern practice, a sign of entreaty or loyalty (see Brauner). Tearing it here is ominous."
I Samuel 15:15,"<b>with faltering-steps:</b> Following LXX; McCarter (1980), following Kimhi, reads it as “in fetters.”"
I Samuel 15:16,"<b>Since bereaved … :</b> The last word of each line rhymes in the Hebrew, creating a more dramatic effect. <b>slashed … [to pieces]:</b> Heb. unclear, but <i>sh-s-f</i> fits the general category of <i>sh-s-x</i> verbs, all of which mean something violent like “plunder” or “cleave.”"
I Samuel 16:1,"<b>Until when:</b> Others, “How long.” <b>Yishai:</b> Pronounced <i>yee-SHY;</i> trad. English “Jesse.” <b>seen among his sons:</b> Following Auld (2011). <b>for me:</b> As contrasted with “us” (Israel) in 8:5 (Kimhi)."
I Samuel 16:2,"<b>sacrificial-meal:</b> In the Bible, meat is rarely eaten outside of a sanctuary—hence the need for ritually purifying (“hallow” in v.5) the family in v.5."
I Samuel 16:3,"<b>Is it in peace, your coming?:</b> A holy man’s visit is not always a cause for rejoicing in the Bible."
I Samuel 16:4,<b>Hallow yourselves:</b> A sacrificial meal required ritual washing.
I Samuel 16:5,<b>Eli’av:</b> Pronounced <i>eh-lee-AHV;</i> trad. English “Eliab.”
I Samuel 16:6,<b>what you see of him:</b> His outward appearance.
I Samuel 16:7,"<b>had him come:</b> The hero is not identified by name until the next verse. It is almost as if his anointing creates him as a person. <b>goodly:</b> Heb. <i>tov</i>, the root which echoes three times from vv.16–23 as “well” in this translation. <b>appearance:</b> Heb. <i>ro’i,</i> again from the root “to see.”"
I Samuel 16:8,"<b>the spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> advanced upon David:</b> Previously, the expression had been used three times about the mighty Shimshon (Judg. 14:6, 19, 15:14). <b>David:</b> Pronounced <i>dah-VEED.</i> This is the first occurrence of the name, which means “beloved.”"
I Samuel 16:9,"<b>an evil spirit:</b> That is, what was previously a gift now becomes a torment."
I Samuel 16:10,"<b>before you:</b> Perhaps connoting “ready” (McCarter 1980). <b>look for:</b> In Chaps. 9–10, this verb was connected to the finding and choosing of Sha’ul as king. <b>strum:</b> The Bible uses different verbs for playing different categories of musical instruments; the present <i>n-g-n</i> applies only to stringed ones."
I Samuel 16:11,"<b>the spirit of God:</b> Obviously, in this case, an evil one. <b>spirit …. respite:</b> Heb. <i>ru’ah … revah,</i> a nice punning contrast between Sha’ul’s malady and the relief that David’s playing provides."
I Samuel 17:1,"<b>Sokho:</b> West of Bet-Lehem, toward Philistine territory."
I Samuel 17:2,<b>Valley of the Oak:</b> Or the “Valley of Ela.”
I Samuel 17:3,"<b>Man of the Space-Between:</b> A champion, to fight his opponent in what we would call No-Man’s-Land. <b>Golyat … Gat:</b> Pronounced <i>gall-YAHT</i> and <i>got;</i> trad. English “Goliath … Gath.” <b>cubits:</b> Biblical units of length based on a man’s forearm, they varied from eighteen to twenty-two inches. At six cubits, Golyat is folktale size. He need not be such a mythical giant, however; LXX reads the phrase as “four cubits,” about six foot nine and thus tall enough to be formidable in any era."
I Samuel 17:4,<b>scimitar:</b> A curved sword.
I Samuel 17:5,"<b>weaver’s beam:</b> McCarter (1984), following Yadin, explains the similarity: the spear contains a thong and rings for slinging, similar to what was found in ancient Greece and Egypt. <b>six hundred shekel-weights:</b> Maybe as much as fifteen pounds—the equivalent of having a bowling ball at the end of his spear!"
I Samuel 17:6,"<b>the youngest:</b> A situation that recurs in folktales; in the Bible, it fits a general pattern beginning in Genesis, where the younger son always prevails."
I Samuel 17:7,"<b>forty days:</b> The usual biblical measure of time, as in the Flood story and many others."
I Samuel 17:8,"<b>the king will enrich him … :</b> Once again, the atmosphere and details resemble those of a folktale."
I Samuel 17:9,"<b>David said … What shall be done … :</b> David’s first biblical words reflect one of his lifelong characteristics, that of seeking political gain (Alter 1999). <b>mocking:</b> The word can also mean “disgrace,” as in Josh. 5:9."
I Samuel 17:10,<b>those words:</b> See v.25.
I Samuel 17:11,"<b>presumption … evil-intentions:</b> This characterization of the “bratty” David by a brother parallels the treatment of Yosef in Genesis.
29–30 <b>words:</b> Singular in the Hebrew."
I Samuel 17:12,<b>David said … :</b> There are no court niceties here; David cuts to the chase. <b>anyone’s:</b> LXX suggests “the king’s.”
I Samuel 17:13,"<b>lad:</b> The word is also used in the Bible with the meaning “squire,” one who is not quite a warrior, so David could easily be eighteen or nineteen, and strong—not a child, as often seen in illustrations. <b>lad … youth:</b> Heb. <i>naar … ne’urav;</i> perhaps “squire … squireship” would express the military sense, but not very elegantly in English."
I Samuel 17:14,"<b>from the hand:</b> From this point on in the narrative, “hand” appears multiple times, connoting power, as often in the Bible."
I Samuel 17:15,"<b>unable:</b> Reading the verb <i>y-’-l</i> as <i>l-’-h,</i> along with LXX."
I Samuel 17:16,"<b>dog:</b> This motif, one of insult, repeats in the following chapters. Here it contrasts nicely with David’s mastery over lions and bears (vv.34–36) (Fokkelman 1993). <b>sticks:</b> Heb. <i>maklot,</i> sounding similar to the immediately following <i>vaykallel,</i> “cursed.”"
I Samuel 17:17,"<b>with the name:</b> A more conventional rendering would be “in the name,” but the Hebrew preposition is the same as the many “withs” earlier in the verse."
I Samuel 17:18,<b>your carcass and:</b> Added by LXX.
I Samuel 17:19,"<b>forehead:</b> Some understand this instead as the shin or a spot on the leg not covered by armor, which would perhaps better explain Golyat’s literal and forward-moving downfall."
I Samuel 17:20,<b>Gat … Ekron:</b> All the way back to the Philistine cities.
I Samuel 17:21,"<b>Jerusalem:</b> Another anomaly in the text; it will not be an Israelite city until David himself conquers it in II Sam. 5. Similarly, as a nonwarrior, David would not have had his own tent."
I Samuel 17:22,"<b>Whose son:</b> Since in the ancient Near East, kings were sometimes referred to as “sons of the gods,” Sha’ul’s question is not as innocent as it seems, at least to the audience. See II Sam. 7:14."
I Samuel 18:1,"<b>self:</b> Or “being.” Heb. <i>nefesh,</i> a person’s life-essence or emotions, is often mistranslated as “soul.”"
I Samuel 18:2,<b>his love for him:</b> Yehonatan’s for David.
I Samuel 18:3,<b>myriads:</b> Units of ten thousand.
I Samuel 18:4,<b>David and the wall [together]:</b> Sha’ul seeks to pin David to the wall.
I Samuel 18:5,"<b>and he went out and came back:</b> David’s actions are described with this idiom denoting military leadership, a role we encountered already in v.5."
I Samuel 18:6,"<b>son of valor:</b> More idiomatically, a “valiant one,” but the word “son” echoes throughout this text."
I Samuel 18:7,<b>living-relatives:</b> LXX from MT: “my life”; it is missing in some LXX manuscripts.
I Samuel 18:8,"<b>Maholatite:</b> Possibly from Avel Mehola, south of Bet-She’an."
I Samuel 18:9,"<b>snare:</b> Driver understands this as “the trigger of a trap” for animals. <b>a second-time:</b> The Hebrew is strange, literally “in two.” Some propose “in two years,” others “two opportunities” or even “two daughters.”"
I Samuel 18:10,<b>a hundred Philistine foreskins:</b> Not so easy to obtain.
I Samuel 18:11,<b>were fulfilled:</b> Passed.
I Samuel 18:12,<b>two hundred:</b> A typical hero move—doubling the test.
I Samuel 19:1,"<b>took exceeding pleasure in:</b> Or “was exceedingly fond of.” On discussions about the possibility of a sexual relationship, see Commentary."
I Samuel 19:2,<b>for good:</b> Favorably.
I Samuel 19:3,<b>the Philistine:</b> Golyat. <b>for nothing:</b> For no cause.
I Samuel 19:4,"<b>through the window:</b> Note that Mikhal will later (II 6:16) despise the man whose life she saves here, upon seeing him “through the window” dancing before the Coffer in what she deems an inappropriate manner (Fokkelman 1991)."
I Samuel 19:5,"<b><i>terafim:</i></b> See note to 15:23, above. <b>a tangle:</b> Following McCarter (1980). <b>it:</b> Though the word is plural in form, a single object seems indicated here."
I Samuel 19:6,<b>Bring him up in the bed:</b> With the force of “Even if you have to carry him here in his bed.”
I Samuel 19:7,"<b>sent … free:</b> I.e., let go."
I Samuel 19:8,"<b>Nayot:</b> Either a place-name, or possibly “pasture-settlements” where prophets lived (McCarter 1980)."

I Samuel 20:1,
I Samuel 20:2,
I Samuel 20:3,
I Samuel 20:4,
I Samuel 20:5,"<b>New-Moon:</b> Hebrew <i>hodesh</i> generally means “month,” but here retains its connection to <i>h-d-sh,</i> “new.” The New Moon was a major festival in biblical times. This chapter is still read by Jews in synagogue on Sabbaths when a New Moon follows on the next day."
I Samuel 20:6,<b>Thus may Y<small>HWH</small> do to Yehonatan … :</b> With the force of “May God strike me down if …”
I Samuel 20:7,<b>Will you not:</b> The repetition here is strange and probably a scribal error.
I Samuel 20:8,<b>from my house:</b> From my family.
I Samuel 20:9,"<b>Yehonatan has cut [a covenant] … may</b> Y<small>HWH</small> <b>seek it:</b> LXX and McCarter (1980) read the first phrase as “If Yehonatan be cut off,” but MT plays nicely here on the verb. “Seek” means “seek retribution” or “hold responsible.” <b>“David’s enemies”:</b> As in II Sam. 12:14, later scribes have added the word “enemies” here, in order to avoid placing a verbal curse on David."
I Samuel 20:10,<b>with the love [he had] … :</b> Following Waltke/O’Connor.
I Samuel 20:11,"<b>incident:</b> Lit. “doing, deed.” <b>that stone:</b> Heb. unclear; MT has “Ezel Stone.” With LXX, Rainey/Notley reads this as a corruption of “this cairn” (Heb. <i>ha-argov ha-lazeh</i>)."
I Samuel 20:12,Y<small>HWH</small> <b>will be between me and you:</b> As a witness.
I Samuel 20:13,"<b>at-the-front:</b> Following LXX (reflecting <i>vykdm</i>); MT has <i>vykm,</i> “arose.”"
I Samuel 20:14,"<b>an accident … not ritually-pure:</b> The New Moon festival required ritual purity of its participants; if one had a bodily discharge of the “polluting” kind, for instance (see Lev. 12–15), one was temporarily excluded."
I Samuel 20:15,"<b>the morrow of the New-Moon:</b> See Fishbane for a discussion of this difficult phrase, which historically has raised ritual calendar questions among Jews in its appearance in Lev. 23:15’s “the morrow of the Sabbath.”"
I Samuel 20:16,"<b>get away:</b> Or “free to go” (McCarter 1980); the word, though, is most often found in contexts of survival, and so its use may be a bit ironic here. Fokkelman (1981) understands it as a Freudian slip which enrages Sha’ul."
I Samuel 20:17,"<b>[You] son of a twisted rebellion!:</b> Ehrlich points out that Sha’ul would not insult his lone wife as the “perverse, rebellious woman” found in most translations. Instead, he proposes that Yehonatan, in the eyes of Sha’ul, is advocating overthrowing his own father by allowing David to live—a “twisted” act. <b>the son of Yishai:</b> Once again, omitting a person’s given name is usually understood in the Bible as an insult."
I Samuel 20:18,<b>firmly-established:</b> Or “secure.” <b>a son of death:</b> Or “a dead man.”

I Samuel 21:4,"<b>hallowed bread:</b> See v.7 and the accompanying note. <b>provided that the lads … :</b> As McCarter (1980) reminds us, holy bread could only be eaten in a state of ritual, and thus sexual, purity; see rules about encountering the holy in Exod. 19:1."
I Samuel 21:5,<b>gear was hallowed:</b> Everything connected with the men was made ritually pure.
I Samuel 21:6,"<b>Bread of the Presence:</b> See Exod. 25:30, where this bread is placed in the “Dwelling” (Tabernacle); it corresponds to food set out for the gods in pagan sanctuaries, whereas here its use is purely symbolic."
I Samuel 21:7,"<b>held-in-custody:</b> The reason for Do’eg’s detention is not stated. <b>Do’eg:</b> Pronounced <i>doe-AYG.</i> The name derives from the verb “to worry,” and he will indeed become more than cause for concern in the next chapter (v.1)."

I Samuel 22:5,"<b>banded together:</b> Others, “conspired.” <b>bares my ear:</b> Meaning “informs me”; I have retained the literal idiom, which occurs three times in this chapter, to keep the reader’s focus on the theme of body parts in Samuel (see Introduction)."
I Samuel 22:6,"<b>obedient-bodyguard:</b> From Heb. <i>shamo’a,</i> “hearken, obey.”"

I Samuel 23:5,"<b>Wilderness of Zif:</b> Southeast of Hevron, flanking the Judean Desert."

I Samuel 25:3,"<b>Naval:</b> Pronounced <i>nah-VAHL;</i> trad. English “Nabal.” In some other contexts it means “fool, foolish one.” A more colloquial translation here might use a word like “jerk.” The name also happens to pun on <i>neveila,</i> “corpse,” in anticipation of the story’s end (see McKenzie 2000). Naval is also the anagram of another biblical villain, Yaakov’s uncle Lavan (Laban) in Genesis. <b>Avigayil:</b> Possibly meaning “My Father [or God] Was Delighted.” Trad. English “Abigail.” <b>Calevite:</b> Descended from Calev, who, with Yehoshua, was one of the “good spies” in Num. 1.
