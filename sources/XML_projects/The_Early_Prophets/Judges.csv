Judges 1:1,"Now it was after the death of Yehoshua
that the Children of Israel inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Who among us will go up first against the Canaanites to wage battle against them?"
Judges 1:2,"Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Yehuda will go up;
here, I have given the land into his hand."
Judges 1:3,"Yehuda said to Shim’on his brother-tribe:
Go up with me into my allotted-territory, and let us wage battle against the Canaanites,
and I will go with you as well into your allotted-territory.
So Shim’on went with him."
Judges 1:4,"Yehuda went up,
and Y<small>HWH</small> gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand,
so that they struck them down in Bezek,
ten thousand men."
Judges 1:5,"They found Adoni-Vezek in Bezek, and waged battle against him,
and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites."
Judges 1:6,"And Adoni-Vezek fled, so they pursued after him,
and they seized him and chopped off the thumbs of his hands and of his feet."
Judges 1:7,"Adoni-Vezek said:
Seventy kings, the thumbs of their hands and of their feet chopped off,
used to gather [crumbs] under my table;
as I did, so has God paid me back!
They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there."
Judges 1:8,"Then the Children of Yehuda waged battle against Jerusalem:
they captured it, they struck it with the mouth of the sword,
and the city they sent up in fire."
Judges 1:9,"Afterward, the Children of Yehuda went down to wage battle against the Canaanites,
those settled in the highlands, the Negev, and the lowlands."
Judges 1:10,"And Yehuda went against the Canaanites, the ones settled in Hevron,
—now the name of Hevron in former times was Kiryat-Arba—
and he struck Sheishai and Ahiman and Talmai."
Judges 1:11,"He went from there against those settled in Devir
—now the name of Devir in former times was Kiryat-Sefer."
Judges 1:12,"Now Calev said:
Whoever strikes Kiryat-Sefer and captures it,
I will give him Akhsa my daughter as a wife!"
Judges 1:13,"Otniel son of Kenaz captured it,
a brother of Calev younger than he,
and he gave him Akhsa his daughter as a wife."
Judges 1:14,"Now it was, when she came,
that she induced him to request fielded-property from her father.
She alighted from on the donkey,
and Calev said to her:
What [ails] you?"
Judges 1:15,"She said to him:
Get me a blessing-gift,
for you have given me arid land—
you should give me pools of water!
So Calev gave her the Upper Pools and the Lower Pools."
Judges 1:16,"Now the Children of the Kenite, Moshe’s father-in-law, went up from the Town of Date-Palms, along with the Children of Yehuda,
into the Wilderness of Yehuda that is south of Arad;
they went and settled with the people."
Judges 1:17,"And Yehuda went with Shim’on his brother;
they struck the Canaanites settled in Tzefat, and devoted-it-to-destruction,
so they called the name of the town Horma/Destruction."
Judges 1:18,"Then Yehuda captured Gaza and its territory
and Ashkelon and its territory
and Ekron and its territory."
Judges 1:19,"Now Y<small>HWH</small> was with Yehuda, so that he took possession of the highlands,
but he was not [able] to dispossess the settled-folk of the valley,
for they had chariotry of iron."
Judges 1:20,"And they gave Hevron to Calev, as Moshe had promised,
and he dispossessed the three sons of Anak from there."
Judges 1:21,"But the Yevusites, those settled in Jerusalem, the Children of Binyamin did not dispossess;
the Yevusites are settled along with the Children of Binyamin in Jerusalem until this day."
Judges 1:22,"Now the house of Yosef went up, they too, to Bet-El,
and Y<small>HWH</small> was with them."
Judges 1:23,"The house of Yosef scouted out Bet-El
—now the name of the town in former times was Luz—"
Judges 1:24,"and the watchmen saw a man going out of the town,
so they said to him:
Pray let us see the way to enter the town, and we will show you loyalty."
Judges 1:25,"He let them see the way to enter the town, and they struck the city with the mouth of the sword,
but the man and his entire clan they sent free."
Judges 1:26,"The man went to the land of the Hittites and built a town;
he called its name Luz
—that is its name until this day."
Judges 1:27,"Menashe did not take possession of Bet-She’an and her daughter-towns,
or of Ta’nakh and her daughter-towns,
or of the settled-folk of Dor and her daughter-towns,
or of the settled-folk of Yivle’am and her daughter-towns,
or of the settled-folk of Megiddo and her daughter-towns;
the Canaanites were determined to remain settled in this region."
Judges 1:28,"And it was, when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites under forced-labor,
but dispossess, they did not dispossess them."
Judges 1:29,"Now Efrayim did not dispossess the Canaanites, those settled in Gezer,
and so the Canaanites remained settled in their midst, in Gezer."
Judges 1:30,"Zevulun did not dispossess the settled-folk of Kitron, or the settled-folk of Nahalol,
and so the Canaanites remained settled in their midst,
and went into forced-labor."
Judges 1:31,"Asher did not dispossess the settled-folk of Akko, or the settled-folk of Sidon,
or of Ahlav, or of Akhziv, or of Helba,
or of Afik, or of Rehov."
Judges 1:32,"So the Asherites settled amid the Canaanites, the settled-folk of the land,
for they did not dispossess them."
Judges 1:33,"Naftali did not dispossess the settled-folk of Bet-Shemesh
or the settled-folk of Bet-Anat,
so they settled amid the Canaanites, the settled-folk of the land,
and the settled-folk of Bet-Shemesh and of Bet-Anat went into forced-labor for them."
Judges 1:34,"And the Amorites pressed the Children of Dan into the highlands,
indeed, they did not give them [leave] to go down into the valley."
Judges 1:35,"The Amorites persisted in remaining settled in Mount Heres, in Ayyalon and in Shaalvim,
yet the hand of the House of Yosef grew heavy [against them], so that they went into forced-labor."
Judges 1:36,"Now the territory of the Amorites was from Scorpions’ Pass, to the Crag and further."
Judges 2:1,"A messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> went up from Gilgal to Bokhim
and said:
I had you go up from Egypt,
and I brought you to the land that I swore to your fathers;
I said:
I will not annul my covenant with you for the ages!"
Judges 2:2,"While you,
you are not to cut a covenant with the settled-folk of this land—
their altars you are to demolish!
But you did not hearken to my voice.
Now what have you done!"
Judges 2:3,"So I also say:
I will not drive them out before you;
they will be traps to you,
and their gods will be a snare to you!"
Judges 2:4,"It was, when the messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken these words to all the Children of Israel,
that the people lifted up their voice and wept."
Judges 2:5,"So they called the name of that place Bokhim/Weepers,
and they sacrificed there to Y<small>HWH</small>."
Judges 2:6,"Yehoshua had sent the fighting-people off,
and the Children of Israel had gone off, each one to his hereditary-property, to take possession of the land."
Judges 2:7,"And the people had served Y<small>HWH</small> all the days of Yehoshua
and all the days of the elders who had prolonged years after Yehoshua,
who had seen every great deed of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had done for Israel."
Judges 2:8,"And Yehoshua son of Nun, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had died, a hundred and ten years old;"
Judges 2:9,"they had buried him in the territory of his hereditary-property, in Timnat-Heres in the highlands of Efrayim, north of the highlands of Gaash."
Judges 2:10,"Now also that entire generation was gathered to its fathers,
and another generation arose after them, that did not know Y<small>HWH</small>,
as well as the deed[s] that he had done for Israel."
Judges 2:11,"And the Children of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
they served the Baals,"
Judges 2:12,"they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of their fathers,
the one who brought them out of the land of Egypt,
and they walked after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them;
they bowed down to them
and so provoked Y<small>HWH</small>—"
Judges 2:13,"they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small>
and served Baal and the Astartes."
Judges 2:14,"So Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against Israel,
and he gave them into the hand of pillagers, so that they pillaged them,
and sold them into the hand of their enemies round about,
so that they were no longer able to stand up before their enemies."
Judges 2:15,"Whenever they went out [to war], the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was against them for evil,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had promised,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had sworn to them,
and they were exceedingly distressed."
Judges 2:16,"Then Y<small>HWH</small> raised up judge-leaders;
they delivered them from the hand of their plunderers."
Judges 2:17,"But also to their judges they did not hearken:
indeed, they went whoring after other gods
and bowed down to them;
they quickly turned aside from the way that their fathers had walked, hearkening to the commands of Y<small>HWH</small>—
they did not do thus."
Judges 2:18,"Now whenever Y<small>HWH</small> raised up judges for them,
Y<small>HWH</small> would be with the judge,
and would deliver them from the hand of their enemies
all the days of the judge,
for Y<small>HWH</small> would feel regret at their moanings, because of their oppressors and their persecutors."
Judges 2:19,"But it would be, upon the death of the judge:
they would return and do ruin, more than their fathers,
by walking after other gods,
by serving them and by bowing down to them;
they would not let any of their actions or their stubborn path fall away."
Judges 2:20,"So Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against Israel,
and he said:
Because this nation has crossed my covenant that I commanded their fathers,
and has not hearkened to my voice,"
Judges 2:21,"for my part, I will not continue to dispossess any before them
from the nations that Yehoshua left behind when he died—"
Judges 2:22,"in order to test Israel through them,
whether they will keep the way of Y<small>HWH</small>, to walk in it,
as their fathers kept, or not."
Judges 2:23,"So Y<small>HWH</small> let these nations stay
and did not dispossess them quickly,
neither did he give them into the hand of Yehoshua."
Judges 3:1,"And these are the nations that Y<small>HWH</small> let remain
to test Israel through them,
all those who knew nothing of all the battles over Canaan,"
Judges 3:2,"only for the sake of knowledge of the Children of Israel’s generations,
to teach them war
—only those who previously had not known them:"
Judges 3:3,"the five Philistine overlord [cities]
and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivvites, the settled-folk of the highlands of the Levanon,
from the mount of Baal Hermon to Levo-Hamat."
Judges 3:4,"They were to test Israel through them,
to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of Y<small>HWH</small>
which he had commanded their fathers, by the hand of Moshe."
Judges 3:5,"So the Children of Israel settled amid the Canaanites,
the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites,
the Hivvites, and the Yevusites;"
Judges 3:6,"they took their daughters for themselves as wives,
while their own daughters they gave to their sons,
and they served their gods."
Judges 3:7,"And the Children of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>;
they forgot Y<small>HWH</small> their God
and served the Baals and the Ashera-poles."
Judges 3:8,"So the anger of Y<small>HWH</small> flared up against Israel,
and he sold them
into the hand of Cushan Rish’atayim/Nubian Double-Wickedness,
king of Aram of the Two Rivers,
and the Children of Israel served Cushan Rish’atayim for eight years."
Judges 3:9,"And the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>,
so Y<small>HWH</small> raised up a deliverer for the Children of Israel, and he delivered them:
Otniel son of Kenaz,
brother of Calev, one younger than he."
Judges 3:10,"Now there [came] upon him the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small>;
he led Israel as judge and went out to battle,
and Y<small>HWH</small> gave into his hand Cushan Rish’atayim king of Aram,
and his hand was powerful against Cushan Rish’atayim."
Judges 3:11,"The land was quiet for forty years;
then Otniel son of Kenaz died."
Judges 3:12,"But the Children of Israel continued to do what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and so Y<small>HWH</small> strengthened Eglon king of Moav over Israel,
since they had done what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Judges 3:13,"He gathered the Children of Ammon and Amalek to him;
then he went and struck Israel,
and he took possession of the Town of Date-Palms."
Judges 3:14,And the Children of Israel served Eglon king of Moav for eighteen years.
Judges 3:15,"And the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>,
so Y<small>HWH</small> raised up a deliverer for them:
Ehud son of Gera, a Binyaminite,
a man restricted in his right hand.
And the Children of Israel sent a tribute-gift by his hand to Eglon king of Moav."
Judges 3:16,"Ehud made himself a sword;
it had two mouths, a <i>gomed</i> its length,
and he strapped it under his garb, over his right thigh."
Judges 3:17,"Then he brought near the tribute-gift to Eglon king of Moav
—now Eglon was an exceedingly well-nourished man—"
Judges 3:18,"and it was, when he had finished bringing near the tribute-gift,
that he sent away the people, those bearing the tribute-gift,"
Judges 3:19,"while he himself returned from the carved-images, those near Gilgal,
and said:
I have a secret message for you, O King!
He said:
Hush!
And they went out from him, all who were standing [in attendance] around him."
Judges 3:20,"When Ehud came to him, he was sitting in the cool upper-chamber that he had, alone.
And Ehud said:
I have a message from God for you!
He arose from his throne,"
Judges 3:21,"and Ehud stretched out his left hand,
and took the sword from on his right thigh
and thrust it into his belly."
Judges 3:22,"Even the grip entered after the flashing-blade,
so that the fat closed up behind the blade,
for he did not draw the sword from his belly,
and the feces came out."
Judges 3:23,"Then Ehud went out toward the porch
and closed the doors of the upper-chamber after himself, and bolted them."
Judges 3:24,"Once he had gone out, his servants came back,
and they saw that here, the doors of the upper-chamber were bolted,
so they said:
Surely he is “covering his feet” in the cool inner-room!"
Judges 3:25,"They waited-anxiously until it was shamefully-late,
and here, he was not opening the doors of the upper-chamber,
so they took the key and opened [them] up—
and here was their lord, fallen on the ground, dead!"
Judges 3:26,"As for Ehud, he had escaped while they tarried;
he crossed by the carved-images, and escaped to Se’ira."
Judges 3:27,"Now it was, when he came [there],
that he gave a thrusting-blast on the <i>shofar,</i> in the highlands of Efrayim,
and the Children of Israel went down with him from the highlands, with him ahead of them."
Judges 3:28,"He said to them:
Come down after me,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has given your enemies, Moav, into your hand!
They went down after him
and took the Jordan crossings from Moav;
they did not let a man cross."
Judges 3:29,"And they struck Moav at that time—
about ten thousand men,
all stout ones, all men of valor;
not a man escaped."
Judges 3:30,"Thus Moav was humbled at that time under the hand of Israel.
And the land was quiet for eighty years."
Judges 3:31,"After him was Shamgar son of Anat:
he struck the Philistines, six hundred men, with an ox-goad;
thus he too delivered Israel."
Judges 4:1,"But the Children of Israel again did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and Ehud was dead."
Judges 4:2,"So Y<small>HWH</small> sold them into the hand of Yavin king of Canaan, who reigned as king in Hatzor;
the commander of his armed-forces was Sisera.
Now he sat [enthroned] at Haroshet of the Nations."
Judges 4:3,"And the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>,
for he had nine hundred iron chariots,
and he had been oppressing the Children of Israel strongly for twenty years."
Judges 4:4,"Now Devora was a prophet woman, wife of Lappidot/Torches;
she was judging Israel at that time."
Judges 4:5,"She was sitting [as judge] under the Palm of Devora, between Rama and Bet-El, in the highlands of Efrayim,
and the Children of Israel would come up to her for judgment."
Judges 4:6,"She sent and called for Barak/Lightning son of Avino’am, from Kedesh in Naftali,
and she said to him:
Has not Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, charged you?
Go deploy at Mount Tavor,
and take with you ten thousand men from the children of Naftali and from the Children of Zevulun;"
Judges 4:7,"I will deploy against you, at Wadi Kishon, Sisera, the commander of Yavin’s forces, along with his chariotry and his throng,
and I will give him into your hand."
Judges 4:8,"Barak said to her:
If you go with me, I will go,
but if you do not go with me, I will not go!"
Judges 4:9,"She said:
I will go, yes, go with you;
but it will not be your glory on the way that you are going.
Rather, it is into the hand of a woman
that Y<small>HWH</small> will sell Sisera!
And Devora arose and went with Barak to Kedesh."
Judges 4:10,"So Barak called up Zevulun and Naftali to Kedesh,
and behind him came up ten thousand men,
while Devora came up with them."
Judges 4:11,"—Now Hever the Kenite had parted from the Kenites,
from the Children of Hovav, Moshe’s father-in-law;
he had spread his tent as far as the oak in Tzaananim, which is near Kedesh.—"
Judges 4:12,"And Sisera was told that Barak son of Avino’am had come up to Mount Tavor,"
Judges 4:13,"so Sisera summoned all his chariotry, nine hundred iron chariots,
and all the fighting-people who were with him,
from Haroshet of the Nations to Wadi Kishon."
Judges 4:14,"Devora said to Barak:
Arise, for this is the day that Y<small>HWH</small> is giving Sisera into your hand!
Does not Y<small>HWH</small> go out [to war] before you?
So Barak came down from Mount Tavor,
with ten thousand men behind him."
Judges 4:15,"And Y<small>HWH</small> panicked Sisera and all the chariotry and all the camp, with the mouth of the sword, before Barak,
and Sisera got down from the chariot and fled on foot."
Judges 4:16,"Now Barak was pursuing after the chariotry and after the camp, as far as Haroshet of the Nations,
while all the camp of Sisera fell by the mouth of the sword;
not even one was left."
Judges 4:17,"Now Sisera had fled on foot, to the tent of Ya’el, the wife of Hever the Kenite,
for there was peace between Yavin king of Hatzor and the house of Hever the Kenite."
Judges 4:18,"Ya’el came out to meet Sisera
and said to him:
Do turn aside, my lord, do turn aside to me, do not be afraid!
So he turned aside to her, to the tent,
and she covered him with a blanket."
Judges 4:19,"He said to her:
Now let me drink a little water, for I am thirsty!
She opened a skin of milk, gave him drink, and covered him."
Judges 4:20,"Then he said to her:
Stand at the entrance to the tent,
and let it be: if anyone comes and asks you, and says:
Is there anyone here?
you are to say: Nobody."
Judges 4:21,"Then Ya’el, the wife of Hever, took a tent peg, and put a hammer in her hand,
and came to him silently
and thrust the peg into his temple, so that it went down into the ground
—now he had been sound asleep, for he was weary—
and he died."
Judges 4:22,"Now here, Barak was pursuing Sisera,
and Ya’el came out to meet him and said to him:
Come, I will show you the man whom you are seeking.
He came to her, and here was Sisera fallen dead, with the peg in his temple!"
Judges 4:23,So on that day God humbled Yavin king of Canaan before the Children of Israel.
Judges 4:24,"And the hand of the Children of Israel went harder [and harder] against Yavin king of Canaan,
until they had [completely] cut off Yavin king of Canaan."
Judges 5:1,"And Devora sang, along with Barak son of Avino’am, on that day, saying:"
Judges 5:2,"When war-loosened [hair] is loose in Israel,
when fighting-people present themselves—
bless Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Judges 5:3,"Hearken, O kings,
give ear, O princes—
I, to Y<small>HWH</small> I will sing,
I will give praise to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel!"
Judges 5:4,"Y<small>HWH</small>, in your going out from Se’ir,
in your striding forth from the Steppes of Edom,
the earth quaked, the heavens too dripped,
the clouds too dripped water,"
Judges 5:5,"the mountains shook before Y<small>HWH</small>, the One of Sinai,
before Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel!"
Judges 5:6,"In the days of Shamgar son of Anat,
in the days of Ya’el, the caravans ceased,
those who walked on roads
walked on twisting paths."
Judges 5:7,"The villagers ceased,
they ceased in Israel,
until you arose, Devora,
you arose, a mother in Israel!"
Judges 5:8,"He chose new gods
—then there was battle in the gates.
Was shield seen, or spear,
among forty thousand in Israel?"
Judges 5:9,"My heart was toward the decree-makers in Israel,
those presenting themselves among the people,
bless Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Judges 5:10,"O those who ride on white she-asses,
those who sit on cloths,
those who walk on the way,
report [it]!"
Judges 5:11,"At the sound of the trumpets by the water-drawers,
there they retell the righteous-acts of Y<small>HWH</small>,
the righteous-acts for his villagers in Israel.
Then they went down to the gates,
the fighting-people of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Judges 5:12,"Bestir, bestir yourself, Devora!
Bestir, bestir yourself, speak forth a song!
Arise, Barak,
and capture your captives, O son of Avino’am!"
Judges 5:13,"Then the remnant went down against the powerful,
the fighting-people of Y<small>HWH</small> went down for me against the mighty!"
Judges 5:14,"From Efrayim, their root in Amalek,
after you, Binyamin, among your people!
From Makhir, the decree-makers went down,
and from Zevulun, leaders with the census-counter’s staff."
Judges 5:15,"Rulers in Yissakhar beside Devora,
as Yissakhar, so Barak,
in the valley, sent out behind him.
In the tribal divisions of Re’uven
was great soul searching:"
Judges 5:16,"why did you sit between the sheepfolds,
hearkening to whistling for flocks?
At the tribal divisions of Re’uven
was great soul searching."
Judges 5:17,"In Gil’ad, across the Jordan he dwelt,
and Dan—why did he sojourn in ships?
Asher sat by the shore of the sea,
by his landing-place he dwelt."
Judges 5:18,"Zevulun—a people risking life amid dying;
Naftali—upon the risen terraces of the field."
Judges 5:19,"Kings came, they waged battle,
then they waged battle, the kings of Canaan,
at Ta’nakh, by Megiddo’s waters—
profit of silver they took none."
Judges 5:20,"From the heavens the stars waged battle,
from their courses they waged battle with Sisera."
Judges 5:21,"The Wadi Kishon swept away [the foe],
the ancient wadi, the Wadi Kishon.
—May my being bless them with strength!"
Judges 5:22,"Then the horses’ hooves pounded
from the dashing, the dashing of their war-steeds!"
Judges 5:23,"Doomed be Meroz, says Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger,
doomed, yes, doomed be her settled-folk,
because they did not come to the help of Y<small>HWH</small>,
to the help of Y<small>HWH</small> among the mighty!"
Judges 5:24,"May she be blessed among women, Ya’el,
wife of Hever the Kenite,
among women in tents may she be blessed!"
Judges 5:25,"Water he asked for, milk she gave,
in a bowl for the valiant, she brought near cream."
Judges 5:26,"Her hand to the peg she stretched out,
her right-hand to the workmen’s pounder.
She pounded Sisera, smashed his head,
she shattered and passed it through his temple."
Judges 5:27,"[?] Between her legs he bent down, he fell, he lay,
between her legs he bent down, he fell,
where he bent down, there he fell, ravaged!"
Judges 5:28,"Through the window she peered,
Sisera’s mother wailed through the lattice:
For-what-reason comes his chariot [so] shamefully-late?
For-what-reason are the beats of his chariots tardy?"
Judges 5:29,"The wisest of her attendants gives answer,
yes, she sends back her words to her:"
Judges 5:30,"Are they not finding, dividing the spoils—
a lass, two lasses for each warrior chief?
Spoils of dyed cloths has Sisera,
spoils of dyed embroidered cloth;
dyed [tunics], embroidered at the neck,
he is taking-as-spoils …."
Judges 5:31,"So perish all your enemies, O Y<small>HWH</small>,
but let those who love you
be like the emergence of the sun in its might!
And the land was quiet for forty years."
Judges 6:1,"But the Children of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into the hand of Midyan, for seven years."
Judges 6:2,"And the hand of Midyan was powerful against Israel;
[in fear] of Midyan, the Children of Israel made use for themselves of the dens that were in the highlands,
as well as the caves, as well as the strongholds."
Judges 6:3,"It would be, whenever Israel would sow seed,
that Midyan would go up, along with Amalek and the Children of the East;
they would go up against it,"
Judges 6:4,"they would encamp against them and would lay ruin the yield of the ground, as far as where-you-come to Gaza,
and they would not leave anything sustaining-life in Israel
for sheep, or for ox, or for donkey."
Judges 6:5,"For they and their acquired-livestock would go up, along with their tents,
and they would come like locusts in abundance
—[what was] theirs and their camels’ was innumerable—
and they came into the land to bring it to ruin."
Judges 6:6,"So the Children of Israel became exceedingly impoverished before Midyan,
and the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>."
Judges 6:7,"And it was, when the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>, on account of Midyan,"
Judges 6:8,"that Y<small>HWH</small> sent a man, a prophet, to the Children of Israel;
he said to them:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
I myself brought you up from Egypt,
and took you out of a house of serfs,"
Judges 6:9,"and rescued you from the hand of Egypt
and from the hand of all your oppressors;
I drove them out from before you
and gave you their land."
Judges 6:10,"And I said to you:
I am Y<small>HWH</small> your God;
you are not to hold in awe the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are settling—
but you did not hearken to my voice!"
Judges 6:11,"Now a messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> came and sat under the oak that is in Ofra, that belonged to Yoash the Avi’ezrite,
while Gid’on/Hewer his son was beating down wheat in the winepress,
to whisk it away from before Midyan."
Judges 6:12,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was seen by him;
he said to him:
Y<small>HWH</small> is with you, O mighty-man of valor!"
Judges 6:13,"Gid’on said to him:
Please, my lord,
if Y<small>HWH</small> is with us,
why has all this found us?
Where are all the wonders which our fathers recounted to us, saying:
Was it not from Egypt that Y<small>HWH</small> brought us up?
Yet now, Y<small>HWH</small> has forsaken us
and has given us into the grasp of Midyan!"
Judges 6:14,"Y<small>HWH</small> faced him and said:
Go forth in this strength of yours
and deliver Israel from the grasp of Midyan!
Have I not sent you?"
Judges 6:15,"He said:
Please, O Lord,
whereby shall I deliver Israel?
Here, my family is the weakest in Menashe,
and I am the youngest in my Father’s House!"
Judges 6:16,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Indeed, I will be with you;
you will strike down Midyan as [if they were] one man!"
Judges 6:17,"He said to him:
Now if I have found favor in your eyes,
make me a sign that it is you speaking to me:"
Judges 6:18,"now do not depart from this-place until I come back to you
and have brought out my gift and placed it before you!
He said:
I will stay until your return."
Judges 6:19,"So Gid’on came out
and made ready a goats’ kid with an <i>efa</i> of unleavened meal:
the meat he put in a basket, while the broth he put in a boiling-pot,
and he took them out to him beneath the oak, and brought them close."
Judges 6:20,"And God’s messenger said to him:
Take the meat and the unleavened bread and place them on this boulder,
and the broth, pour out.
He did so."
Judges 6:21,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger stretched out the tip of the crook that was in his hand
and touched the meat and the unleavened bread;
and fire went up from the rock
and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread,
while Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger went away from his eyes."
Judges 6:22,"Gid’on saw that he was Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger,
so Gid’on said:
Alas, my Lord Y<small>HWH</small>,
for now I have seen Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger face to face!"
Judges 6:23,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Peace be to you—do not be afraid; you will not die."
Judges 6:24,"Gid’on built there a sacrificial-altar to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and he called it: Y<small>HWH</small> of Peace.
Until this day, it is still in Ofra of the Avi’ezrites."
Judges 6:25,"It was on that night that Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Take an ox bull that belongs to your father,
a second-born bull, seven years old:
you are to tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father,
and the Ashera-pole that is next to it you are to cut down,"
Judges 6:26,"and you are to build an altar to Y<small>HWH</small> your God
on the top of this stronghold in an arrangement [of stones];
then you are to take the second-born bull
and are to offer it up as an offering-up, with the wood of the Ashera-pole that you cut down."
Judges 6:27,"Gid’on took ten men from his servants
and did as Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken to him.
Now it was, because he was too afraid of his Father’s House and of the men of the town to do it during the day,
that he did it during the night."
Judges 6:28,"The men of the town started-early in the morning,
and here, the altar of Baal had been demolished,
and the Ashera-pole that was next to it had been cut down,
and the second-born bull had been offered up upon the rebuilt altar!"
Judges 6:29,"They said, each one to his fellow:
Who did this thing?
They made inquiry and searched,
and they said:
Gid’on son of Yoash did this thing!"
Judges 6:30,"So the men of the town said to Yoash:
Bring out your son, that he may die,
because he demolished the altar of Baal,
and because he cut down the Ashera-pole that was next to it!"
Judges 6:31,"But Yoash said to all who were standing [in attendance] around him:
Will you yourselves strive for Baal?
Or will you yourselves deliver him?
Whoever strives for him will be put to death by daybreak!
If he is a god, let him strive for himself
when someone demolishes his altar!"
Judges 6:32,"So they called him from that day on: Yerub-baal/Let-Baal-Strive, saying:
Let Baal strive with him,
because he demolished his altar!"
Judges 6:33,"Now all Midyan and Amalek and the Children of the East gathered together;
they crossed over and camped in the Valley of Yizre’el."
Judges 6:34,"But the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> clothed Gid’on;
he gave a blast on the <i>shofar</i> and the Avi’ezrite-clan was summoned after him."
Judges 6:35,"He sent messengers to all of Menashe,
and they rallied to the summons, they too, after him,
and he sent messengers to Asher, to Zevulun, and to Naftali,
and they went up to meet them."
Judges 6:36,"Gid’on said to God:
If you wish to deliver Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,"
Judges 6:37,"here: I am setting a clipping of wool on the threshing-floor;
if dew is on the clipping alone, but on all the ground [it is] dry,
then I will know
that you will deliver Israel by my hand, as you have spoken."
Judges 6:38,"And it was so.
He started-early on the morrow;
he wrung out the clipping
and drained the dew from the clipping—
a bowl full of water."
Judges 6:39,"Then Gid’on said to God:
Do not let your anger flare up against me,
but let me speak just one [more] time:
pray let me make a test only one [more] time with the clipping;
pray let there be dryness on the clipping alone,
but on all the ground let there be dew."
Judges 6:40,"And God did so on that night:
here was dryness on the clipping alone,
but on all the ground there was dew."
Judges 7:1,"Now Yerub-baal—that is Gid’on—and all the fighting-people who were with him started-early;
they camped by En Harod/Spring of Trembling,
while the camp of Midyan was north of it,
at Giv’at Ha-Moreh/Hill of the Sage, in the valley."
Judges 7:2,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
Too many are the fighting-people who are with you
for me to give Midyan into their hand.
—lest Israel honor itself over me, saying:
<i>My</i> [own] hand delivered me!"
Judges 7:3,"So-now,
pray call out in the hearing of the people, saying:
Who is fearful and trembling?
Let him turn back and depart from Mount Gil’ad!
So there turned back from the people twenty-two thousand, while ten thousand remained."
Judges 7:4,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
Still the people are too many!
Lead them down to the water,
that I may refine them for you there:
it will be, [the one] about whom I say to you: This one shall go with you,
he shall go with you,
and [the one] about whom I say to you: This one shall not go beside you,
he shall not go."
Judges 7:5,"So he led the people down to the water,
and Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
Whosoever licks with his tongue from the water, as a dog licks,
set him aside,
but whosoever crouches on his knees to drink …"
Judges 7:6,"Now the number of those who licked, from their hand to their mouth,
was three hundred men,
while all the rest of the people crouched on their knees to drink water."
Judges 7:7,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
By the three hundred men, those who were licking, I will deliver you;
I will give Midyan into your hand,
and then all the people will go, each one back to his place."
Judges 7:8,"So they took the people’s provisions in their hand, along with their <i>shofars,</i>
while all the fighting-men of Israel he sent away, each to his tents,
but of the three hundred men he kept hold.
Now the camp of Midyan was beneath him, in the valley."
Judges 7:9,"And it was on that night
that Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Arise, go down against the camp,
for I have given it into your hand!"
Judges 7:10,"And if you are afraid to go down [to attack],
go down, you along with Pura your serving-lad, to the camp,"
Judges 7:11,"and hearken to what they are saying;
afterward your hands will be strengthened, so that you may go down against the camp.
So he went down, he and Pura his serving-lad, to the edge of the armed men who were in the camp."
Judges 7:12,"Now Midyan and Amalek and all the Children of the East were sprawled out in the valley, like locusts in abundance,
and their camels had no number,
like the sand that is on the shore of the sea in abundance."
Judges 7:13,"And Gid’on came, and here, a man was recounting a dream to his fellow;
he said:
Here, I have dreamt a dream,
and here, a loaf of barley bread was turning over in the camp of Midyan.
It came as far as the tent and struck it, and it fell;
it overturned it, upward,
and the tent fell down!"
Judges 7:14,"His fellow spoke up and said:
This is none other than the sword of Gid’on son of Yoash, the man of Israel!
God has given Midyan into his hand, yes, the entire camp!"
Judges 7:15,"It was, when Gid’on heard the recounting of the dream and its interpretation,
that he bowed low;
then he returned to the camp of Israel
and said:
Arise, for Y<small>HWH</small> has given into our hand the camp of Midyan!"
Judges 7:16,"He split up the three hundred men into three companies,
and he placed <i>shofars</i> in everyone’s hand along with empty jugs, and torches inside the jugs,"
Judges 7:17,"and said to them:
Look at me and do thus:
when I come to the outskirts of the camp,
let it be: as I do, so you are to do:"
Judges 7:18,"I will sound a blast on the <i>shofar,</i> I and all who are with me,
and then you are to sound a blast on the <i>shofars,</i> you as well, all around the entire camp,
and you are to say:
For Y<small>HWH</small> and for Gid’on!"
Judges 7:19,"So Gid’on came, along with the hundred men who were with him, to the outskirts of the camp,
at the beginning of the middle watch
—they had just installed, installed the watchmen—
and they sounded blasts on the <i>shofars,</i> with the jugs that were in their hand [ready to be] shattered."
Judges 7:20,"And the three companies sounded blasts on the <i>shofars,</i> and broke the jugs;
they gripped the torches in their left hands,
and in their right hands, the <i>shofars,</i> to sound blasts,
and called out:
A sword for Y<small>HWH</small> and for Gid’on!"
Judges 7:21,"Then they stood still, each one in his position all around the camp,
and the entire camp was on the run;
they shouted and they fled."
Judges 7:22,"The three hundred <i>shofars were</i> sounded,
and Y<small>HWH</small> put each one’s sword against his fellow, that is, against the entire camp,"
Judges 7:23,"The men of Israel were mustered from Naftali, from Asher, and from all of Menashe,
and they pursued after Midyan."
Judges 7:24,"Now Gid’on had sent messengers throughout all the highlands of Efrayim, saying:
Go down to meet Midyan [in battle], and take the water from them, as far as Bet-Bara and the Jordan!
So all the men of Efrayim were mustered, and they captured the water, as far as Bet-Bara and the Jordan."
Judges 7:25,"And they captured the two commanders of Midyan, Orev/Raven and Ze’ev/Wolf;
they killed Orev at Raven’s Rock, while Ze’ev they killed at Wolf’s Vat
—for they had pursued as far as Midyan—
and the heads of Orev and Ze’ev they brought to Gid’on, from across the Jordan."
Judges 8:1,"Then the men of Efrayim said to him:
What is this thing you have done to us, not calling for us
when you went to do battle against Midyan?
And they strove with him strongly."
Judges 8:2,"He said to them:
What now have I done against you?
Are not the gleanings of Efrayim better than the vintage of Avi’ezer?"
Judges 8:3,"Into your hand God has given the commanders of Midyan, Orev and Ze’ev;
what have I been able to do compared to you?
And their spirit [of anger] subsided from upon him, when he spoke these words."
Judges 8:4,"Gid’on came to the Jordan,
crossing over, he and the three hundred men who were with him,
weary and in pursuit."
Judges 8:5,"He said to the men of Sukkot:
Now give some round-loaves of bread to the fighting-people who are behind me,
for they are weary,
while I will pursue after Zevah and Tzalmunna, the kings of Midyan."
Judges 8:6,"The commanders of Sukkot said:
Is the grasp of Zevah and Tzalmunna now in your hand,
that we should give your forces bread?"
Judges 8:7,"Gid’on said:
Therefore,
when God gives Zevah and Tzalmunna into my hand,
I will tread over your flesh with wilderness thorns and with nettles!"
Judges 8:8,"He went up from there to Penuel, and spoke to them like this,
and the men of Penuel answered him
as the men of Sukkot had answered."
Judges 8:9,"So he said also to the men of Penuel, saying:
Upon my return in peace,
I will demolish this tower!"
Judges 8:10,"Now Zevah and Tzalmunna were in Karkor,
and their camps were with them, about fifteen thousand,
all who were left from the entire camp of the Children of the East,
for those fallen were a hundred and twenty thousand men drawing the sword."
Judges 8:11,"And Gid’on went up by the Road of the Tent Dwellers, east of Novah and Yogbeha,
and he struck the camp, while the camp was feeling-secure."
Judges 8:12,"Zevah and Tzalmunna fled, but he pursued after them,
and he captured the two kings of Midyan, Zevah and Tzalmunna,
and made the entire camp tremble."
Judges 8:13,"Gid’on son of Yoash returned from the battle, from Heres Pass,"
Judges 8:14,"and he captured a lad from the men of Sukkot, and questioned him,
and he wrote out for him [the names of] the commanders of Sukkot and its elders,
seventy-seven men."
Judges 8:15,"Then he came to the men of Sukkot
and said:
Here are Zevah and Tzalmunna, with whom you mocked me, saying:
Is the grasp of Zevah and Tzalmunna now in your hand,
that we should give your weary men bread?"
Judges 8:16,"So he took the elders of the town, and the wilderness thorns and the nettles,
and trod over the men of Sukkot with them,"
Judges 8:17,"while the tower of Penuel he demolished, and killed the men of the town."
Judges 8:18,"Then he said to Zevah and Tzalmunna:
What about the men whom you killed at Tavor?
They said:
Like you were they,
every one like the appearance of the king’s sons."
Judges 8:19,"He said:
They were my brothers, the sons of my mother!
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
if [only] you had let them live,
I would not have to kill you!"
Judges 8:20,"And he said to Yeter his firstborn:
Rise up, kill them!
But the lad would not draw his sword,
for he was afraid,
for he was still a lad."
Judges 8:21,"Then Zevah and Tzalmunna said:
Rise up, you yourself, and attack us,
for as the man is, [so] is his might!
So Gid’on arose and killed Zevah and Tzalmunna,
and he took the crescent-ornaments that were on their camels’ necks."
Judges 8:22,"Now the men of Israel said to Gid’on:
Rule over us—so you, so your son, so your son’s son,
for you have delivered us from the hand of Midyan!"
Judges 8:23,"Gid’on said to them:
<i>I</i> will not rule over you,
my son will not rule over you—
Y<small>HWH</small> will rule over you!"
Judges 8:24,"Then Gid’on said to them:
I have a request to request of you:
Give me, each one, a ring from his spoils!
—for they had gold rings, for they were Yishmaelites."
Judges 8:25,"They said:
We will give, yes, give [them] over.
So they spread out a cloth
and threw there, each one, a ring from his spoils."
Judges 8:26,"Now the weight of the gold rings that he requested
was a thousand and seven hundred [weights of] gold,
aside from the crescents and the pearl-drops and the purple garments that were on the kings of Midyan,
and aside from the collars that were around their camels’ necks."
Judges 8:27,"And Gid’on made it into an <i>efod;</i>
he set it up in his town, in Ofra,
and all Israel went whoring after it there.
It became a snare <i>for Gid’on</i> and for his house."
Judges 8:28,"And Midyan was humbled before the Children of Israel,
so that they could no longer lift up their head.
And the land was quiet for forty years in the days of Gid’on."
Judges 8:29,Yerub-baal son of Yoash went and settled down in his house.
Judges 8:30,"Now Gid’on had seventy sons issuing from his loins,
for he had many wives."
Judges 8:31,"As for his concubine, who was in Shekhem, she too bore him a son;
he appointed his name Avimelekh/Father-is-King."
Judges 8:32,"And Gid’on son of Yoash died at a good ripe age,
and was buried in the burial place of Yoash his father,
in Ofra of the Avi’ezrites."
Judges 8:33,"Now it was, when Gid’on died,
that the Children of Israel returned and went whoring after the Baals;
they made Baal Berit a god for themselves."
Judges 8:34,"The Children of Israel did not keep Y<small>HWH</small> their God in mind,
the one rescuing them from the hand of all their enemies round about,"
Judges 8:35,"and they did not act in loyalty with the house of Yerub-baal Gid’on,
in accordance with all the good things that he had done for Israel."
Judges 9:1,"Avimelekh son of Yerub-baal went to Shekhem, to his mother’s brothers
and spoke to them and to the entire clan of his mother’s Father’s House, saying:"
Judges 9:2,"Now speak in the hearing of all the landowners of Shekhem:
What is better for you—
for seventy men to rule over you, all of Yerub-baal’s sons,
or for one man to rule over you?
And keep in mind
that I am your bone and your flesh!"
Judges 9:3,"So his mother’s brothers spoke concerning him, in the hearing of all the landowners of Shekhem,
all these words,
and their heart inclined after Avimelekh,
for they said: He is our brother!"
Judges 9:4,"So they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple-house of Baal Berit,
and with them Avimelekh hired some empty and impetuous men;
they went [following] after him."
Judges 9:5,"He came to his Father’s House, to Ofra,
and killed his brothers, Yerub-baal’s sons,
seventy men on one stone;
but Yotam son of Yerub-baal, the youngest, was left,
for he had hidden himself."
Judges 9:6,"Then gathered all the landowners of Shekhem and all of Bet-Millo
and went and kinged Avimelekh as king,
alongside the oak of the monument that is in Shekhem."
Judges 9:7,"Yotam was told [about it],
so he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim
and lifted up his voice and called out;
he said to them:
Hearken to me, O landowners of Shekhem,
that God may hearken to you!"
Judges 9:8,"The trees went, they went to anoint a king over themselves.
And they said to the olive:
Reign as king over us!"
Judges 9:9,"The olive said to them:
Should I be made to leave my luxuriant-oil
through which gods and men honor themselves,
that I should go and hold sway over the trees?"
Judges 9:10,"So the trees said to the fig:
<i>You</i> go, reign as king over us!"
Judges 9:11,"The fig said to them:
Should I be made to leave my sweetness and my good produce,
that I should go and hold sway over the trees?"
Judges 9:12,"So the trees said to the grapevine:
<i>You</i> go, reign as king over us!"
Judges 9:13,"The grapevine said to them:
Should I be made to leave my new-wine,
which gives joy to gods and men,
that I should go and hold sway over the trees?"
Judges 9:14,"So all the trees said to the <i>atad:</i>
<i>You</i> go, reign as king over us!"
Judges 9:15,"The <i>atad</i> said to the trees:
If [it is] in faithfulness you are anointing me as king over you,
come, take refuge in my shade;
but if not—
then let fire come forth from the <i>atad</i>
and devour the cedars of the Levanon!"
Judges 9:16,"So-now, if you acted in truth and integrity
when you made Avimelekh king,
and if you acted in good-faith with Yerub-baal and with his house,
and if you acted in accordance with the dealings of his hands"
Judges 9:17,"—[seeing] that my father did battle for you
and threw aside his own life and rescued you from the hand of Midyan,"
Judges 9:18,"yet you, you have risen up against my Father’s House today
and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone,
and have made Avimelekh, son of his maid, king over the landowners of Shekhem, because he is your brother—"
Judges 9:19,"so if you have acted in truth and integrity with Yerub-baal and his house this day,
may you rejoice in Avimelekh, and may he rejoice in you!"
Judges 9:20,"But if not,
may fire come forth from Avimelekh
and devour the landowners of Shekhem and Bet-Millo,
and may fire come forth from the landowners of Shekhem and Bet-Millo
and devour Avimelekh!"
Judges 9:21,"Then Yotam fled:
he ran away and went to Be’er and settled there,
away from the face of Avimelekh his brother."
Judges 9:22,Avimelekh governed Israel for three years.
Judges 9:23,"Then God sent a spirit of evil between Avimelekh and the landowners of Shekhem,
and the landowners of Shekhem broke faith with Avimelekh,"
Judges 9:24,"so that the wrong [done] the seventy sons of Yerub-baal, and their bloodguilt, might come
to be placed on Avimelekh their brother, who had killed them,
and on the landowners of Shekhem,
who had strengthened his hands to kill his brothers."
Judges 9:25,"So the landowners of Shekhem set up ambushers against him on the summits of the mountains,
and they robbed all those who were crossing them on the road.
And it was told to Avimelekh."
Judges 9:26,"Then Gaal/Loathing son of Eved/Slave came, along with his brothers,
and they crossed through Shekhem.
And the landowners of Shekhem put [their] trust in him."
Judges 9:27,"So they went out into the open-field, amassed their vineyards’ [grapes], and trod [them] out,
and they made jubilation;
then they entered the temple-house of their god, and ate and drank,
and made light of Avimelekh."
Judges 9:28,"Gaal son of Eved said:
Who is Avimelekh, and who is Shekhem, that we should serve him?
Is he not the son of Yerub-baal, and Zevul is his adjutant?
The men of Hamor, Shekhem’s father, should serve him,
but why should we serve him ourselves?"
Judges 9:29,"O who would give this people into my hand, that I might remove Avimelekh,
that someone would say to Avimelekh:
Drive off your forces and go away!"
Judges 9:30,"But Zevul the commander of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Eved,
and his anger flared up,"
Judges 9:31,"so he sent messengers to Avimelekh at Aruma, saying:
Here, Gaal son of Eved and his brothers have come to Shekhem,
and here, they are besieging the town against you!"
Judges 9:32,"So-now, arise at night,
you and the fighting-people who are with you,
and wait in ambush in the open-country;"
Judges 9:33,"and it will be in the morning, when the sun rises:
start-early and spread out against the city,
and here, [when] he and the fighting-people who are with him go out to you,
you may do with him whatever your hand finds."
Judges 9:34,"So Avimelekh arose, and all the fighting-people who were with him, at night;
they lay in ambush against Shekhem, in four companies."
Judges 9:35,"Gaal son of Eved went out and stood at the entrance to the town gate,
and Avimelekh and all the people who were with him arose from the ambush."
Judges 9:36,"Gaal saw the people, and he said to Zevul:
Here, fighting-people are coming down from the mountains!
Zevul said to him:
It is the shadow of the mountains that you see as men!"
Judges 9:37,"But Gaal continued further to speak and said:
Here, fighting-people are coming down from the Navel of the Land,
and one company is coming by way of the Soothsayers’ Oak!"
Judges 9:38,"Zevul said to him:
Where, now, is your mouth that was saying:
Who is Avimelekh, that we should serve him?
Isn’t this the people whom you rejected?
Pray go out now and wage battle against them!"
Judges 9:39,"So Gaal went out before the landowners of Shekhem
and waged battle against Avimelekh."
Judges 9:40,"And Avimelekh pursued him, so that he fled from his face,
and many wounded fell, up to the entrance of the gate."
Judges 9:41,"Avimelekh stayed in Aruma,
and Zevul drove out Gaal and his brothers from being settled in Shekhem."
Judges 9:42,"Now it was on the morrow
that the people went out to the open-country and told Avimelekh."
Judges 9:43,"So he took the fighting-people and split them into three companies
and waited in ambush in the open-country.
And he saw that here, the fighting-people were going out of the town,
so he arose against them and struck them."
Judges 9:44,"Now Avimelekh and the companies that were with him spread out
and took their stand at the entrance to the town gate,
while the two [other] companies spread out against all those who were in the open-country, and struck them."
Judges 9:45,"Avimelekh was waging battle against the town all that day,
and he captured the town,
and all the people who were in it, he killed;
then he demolished the town, and sowed it with salt."
Judges 9:46,"And all the landowners of the Tower of Shekhem heard,
so they came to the underground-chamber of the Temple-House of El-Berit."
Judges 9:47,"And it was told to Avimelekh that all the landowners of the Tower of Shekhem had gathered,"
Judges 9:48,"so Avimelekh went up the Mount of Tzalmon,
he and all the fighting-people who were with him,
and Avimelekh took axes in his hand
and cut down tree branch-clumps;
he lifted them up, put them on his shoulder
and said to the fighting-people who were with him:
What you see me do—quickly, do like me!"
Judges 9:49,"So all the fighting-people also cut down, each one, a branch,
and they went [following] after Avimelekh;
they put them on the underground-chamber and kindled the cavern over them with fire,
so that also all the men of the Tower of Shekhem died, about a thousand men and women."
Judges 9:50,"Avimelekh went to Tevetz
and encamped against Tevetz, that he might capture it."
Judges 9:51,"Now there was a strong tower in the midst of the town,
and they fled there, all the men and women, that is, all the landowners of the town;
they shut it upon themselves
and went up on the roof of the tower."
Judges 9:52,"And Avimelekh came up to the tower and waged battle against it,
but when he approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire,"
Judges 9:53,"a woman threw a riding millstone onto Avimelekh’s head
and crushed his skull."
Judges 9:54,"Quickly he called out to his serving-lad, his weapons bearer,
and said to him:
Draw your sword and dispatch me,
lest they say of me: A woman killed him!
So his serving-lad pierced him through, and he died."
Judges 9:55,"When the fighting-men of Israel saw that Avimelekh was dead,
they went [home], each one to his place."
Judges 9:56,"Thus God returned the evil of Avimelekh
that he had done to his father, by killing his seventy brothers,"
Judges 9:57,"while all the evil of the men of Shekhem, God returned on their heads,
and the curse of Yotam son of Yerub-baal came upon them."
Judges 10:1,"There arose after Avimelekh, to deliver Israel,
Tola/Scarlet son of Pua son of Dodo, a man of Yissakhar.
Now he was settled in Shamir, in the highlands of Efrayim."
Judges 10:2,"He led Israel as judge for twenty-three years;
then he died, and was buried in Shamir."
Judges 10:3,"There arose after him Ya’ir the Gil’adite;
he led Israel as judge for twenty-two years."
Judges 10:4,"He had thirty sons riding on thirty foals,
and they had thirty towns;
those they call the Tent-Villages of Ya’ir until this day, that are in the land of Gil’ad."
Judges 10:5,"Then Ya’ir died, and was buried in Kamon."
Judges 10:6,"But the Children of Israel continued doing what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>;
they served the Baals and the Astartes
and the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moav,
the gods of the Children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines;
they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small>, and did not serve him."
Judges 10:7,"So Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against the Children of Israel,
and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Children of Ammon;"
Judges 10:8,"they shattered and battered the Children of Israel from that year on for eighteen years—
all the Children of Israel who were across the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gil’ad."
Judges 10:9,"And the Children of Ammon crossed the Jordan to wage battle also against Yehuda, and against Binyamin, and against the House of Efrayim,
and Israel was exceedingly distressed."
Judges 10:10,"So Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
We have sinned against you!
For we have abandoned our God
and have served the Baals!"
Judges 10:11,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to the Children of Israel:
Did not [I deliver you] from Egypt and from the Amorites and from the Children of Ammon and from the Philistines?"
Judges 10:12,"And when the Sidonians and Amalek and Midyan oppressed you,
you cried out to me,
and I delivered you from their hand;"
Judges 10:13,"but you have abandoned me, and served other gods—
therefore I will not continue to deliver you."
Judges 10:14,"Go cry out to the gods whom you have chosen,
let <i>them</i> deliver you at the time of your distress!"
Judges 10:15,"The Children of Israel said to Y<small>HWH</small>:
We have sinned!
Do, you yourself, to us
according with whatever is good in your eyes,
only: just rescue us this day!"
Judges 10:16,"So they removed the foreign gods from their midst
and served Y<small>HWH</small>,
and he became short-tempered with the travails of Israel."
Judges 10:17,"The Children of Ammon mustered [troops] and encamped in Gil’ad,
while the Children of Israel gathered and encamped in Mitzpa."
Judges 10:18,"The fighting-people, the commanders of Gil’ad, said each one to his fellow:
Who is the man that will be first to do battle against the Children of Ammon?
He shall be head of all the settled-folk of Gil’ad!"
Judges 11:1,"Now Yiftah the Gil’adite was a mighty-man of valor,
but he was the son of a whore woman;
Gil’ad begot Yiftah."
Judges 11:2,"And Gil’ad’s wife bore him sons,
but when the wife’s sons grew up,
they drove Yiftah away and said to him:
You shall not get hereditary-property in our Father’s House,
for you are the son of a different woman!"
Judges 11:3,"So Yiftah ran away from the face of his brothers
and settled in the land of Tov/Good.
And there gathered around Yiftah empty men;
they went out [to war] beside him."
Judges 11:4,"Now it was after some years
that the Children of Ammon did battle with Israel,"
Judges 11:5,"and it was, when the Children of Ammon did battle with Israel
that the elders of Gil’ad went to fetch Yiftah from the land of Tov."
Judges 11:6,"They said to Yiftah:
Come now and become chief for us,
that we may wage battle against the Children of Ammon!"
Judges 11:7,"Yiftah said to the elders of Gil’ad:
Is it not you who spurned me
and drove me away from my Father’s House?
So for-what-reason have you come to me now,
when you are in distress?"
Judges 11:8,"The elders of Gil’ad said to Yiftah:
Agreed, [but] now we have returned to you, so that you may go with us
and wage battle against the Children of Ammon,
that you may be headman for us,
for all the settled-folk of Gil’ad!"
Judges 11:9,"Yiftah said to the elders of Gil’ad:
If you reinstate me, yourselves, to wage battle against the Children of Ammon,
so that Y<small>HWH</small> gives them before me,
<i>I</i> will be headman for you."
Judges 11:10,"The elders of Gil’ad said to Yiftah:
May Y<small>HWH</small> be hearer between us:
if we do not do so, in accordance with your word … !"
Judges 11:11,"So Yiftah went with the elders of Gil’ad,
and the people set him as headman and as chief over them;
and Yiftah spoke all his terms in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa."
Judges 11:12,"Then Yiftah sent messengers to the king of the Children of Ammon, saying:
What is there [between] me and you,
that you come to me, to wage battle against my land?"
Judges 11:13,"The king of the Children of Ammon said to Yiftah’s messengers:
Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt,
from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok, as far as the Jordan.
So-now, return it peaceably!"
Judges 11:14,Yiftah once again sent messengers to the king of the Children of Ammon;
Judges 11:15,"he said to him:
Thus says Yiftah:
Israel did not take away the land of Moav or the land of the Children of Ammon;"
Judges 11:16,"rather, when they came up from Egypt,
Israel went through the wilderness, near the Sea of Reeds, and came to Kadesh."
Judges 11:17,"And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying:
Now let me cross through your land.
But the king of Edom did not hearken,
and they sent also to the king of Moav, but he was not willing,
so Israel stayed at Kadesh."
Judges 11:18,"Then they went through the wilderness and circled around the land of Edom and the land of Moav,
and they came to the sun-rise [side] of the land of Moav, and encamped across the Arnon,
but they did not come into the territory of Moav,
for the Arnon is the territory-border of Moav."
Judges 11:19,"And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon;
Israel said to him:
Now let me cross through your land, to my place."
Judges 11:20,"But Sihon did not trust Israel to cross through his territory;
Sihon gathered all his fighting-people and encamped at Yahatz,
and did battle with Israel."
Judges 11:21,"But Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel gave Sihon and all his fighting-people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them,
so Israel came to possess the entire land of the Amorites, the settled-folk of that land."
Judges 11:22,"They took possession of the entire territory of the Amorites,
from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan."
Judges 11:23,"So-now,
Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel dispossessed the Amorites before his people Israel—
and you, you would take possession of it?"
Judges 11:24,"Is it not: what Kemosh your god dispossesses, of <i>that</i> you may take possession,
and whatever Y<small>HWH</small> our God dispossesses before us, of <i>that</i> we may take possession?"
Judges 11:25,"So-now, are you better, yes, better than Balak son of Tzippor, king of Moav?
Did he strive, yes, strive with Israel,
or wage battle, yes, battle against them?"
Judges 11:26,"When Israel remained-settled in Heshbon and its daughter-towns, and in Ar’or and its daughter-towns,
and in all the towns that are along the Arnon,
for three hundred years,
for-what-reason did you not rescue [them] during that time?"
Judges 11:27,"As for me, I have not sinned against you,
yet you do me evil by waging battle against me!
May Y<small>HWH</small> the judge render judgment today between Israel and the Children of Ammon!"
Judges 11:28,But the king of the Children of Ammon did not hearken to Yiftah’s words which he had sent to him.
Judges 11:29,"Now there came upon Yiftah the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small>;
he crossed over to Gil’ad and Menashe,
and he crossed over to Mitzpe of Gil’ad, and from Mitzpe of Gil’ad he crossed over to the Children of Ammon."
Judges 11:30,"And Yiftah vowed a vow to Y<small>HWH</small> and said:
If you will give, yes, give the Children of Ammon into my hand,"
Judges 11:31,"it will be: the one going out who goes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the Children of Ammon
shall be Y<small>HWH</small>’s
and shall be offered up by me as an offering-up!"
Judges 11:32,"So Yiftah crossed over to the Children of Ammon, to wage battle against them,
and Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into his hand;"
Judges 11:33,"he struck them from Aro’er as far as where-you-come to Minnit,
twenty towns, and as far as Avel-Keramim,
an exceedingly great striking down,
and the Children of Ammon were humbled before the Children of Israel."
Judges 11:34,"Yiftah came back to Mitzpa, to his house,
and here, his daughter was going out to meet him, with timbrels and with dancing
—yet she was a lone-child, he had no son or daughter beside her."
Judges 11:35,"It was, when he saw her,
that he tore his garments
and said:
Alas, my daughter! You have cast, yes, cast me down,
you have become my disaster—
for I myself opened my mouth to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and I am not able to turn it back!"
Judges 11:36,"She said to him:
Father, you opened your mouth to Y<small>HWH</small>;
do with me as has gone out of your mouth,
since Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought for you acts of vengeance against your enemies, from the Children of Ammon!"
Judges 11:37,"And she said to her father:
Let this thing be done for me:
let me be for two months,
so that I may go down upon the highlands
and weep for my womanhood, I and my companions."
Judges 11:38,"He said:
Go.
He sent her off for two months,
and she went, she and her companions,
and wept for her womanhood upon the hills."
Judges 11:39,"It was at the end of two months
that she returned to her father,
and he wrought upon her his vow that he had vowed.
Now she had never known a man.
And it became a rule in Israel:"
Judges 11:40,"from year-day to year-day, the daughters of Israel go to
retell [the tale] of the daughter of Yiftah the Gil’adite,
four days a year."
Judges 12:1,"The men of Efrayim were mustered;
they crossed over to Tzafon
and said to Yiftah:
For-what-reason did you cross over to wage battle against the Children of Ammon,
but <i>us</i> you did not call to go with you?
Your house we will burn down over you with fire!"
Judges 12:2,"Yiftah said to them:
I was a man in strife, I and my people and the Children of Ammon, exceedingly much;
I summoned you, but you did not deliver me from their hand,"
Judges 12:3,"so when I saw that you were not acting-as-deliverer,
I put my life in my palm and crossed over to the Children of Ammon,
and Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into my hand.
So why have you come up against me this day, to wage battle against me?"
Judges 12:4,"And Yiftah gathered all the fighting-men of Gil’ad and did battle with Efrayim,
and the men of Gil’ad struck Efrayim,
for they had said:
Fugitives of Efrayim are you, [men of] Gil’ad;
[being] among Efrayim is [like being] among Menashe!"
Judges 12:5,"And Gil’ad took the Jordan crossings of Efrayim.
Now it would be, when [one of] the fugitives of Efrayim would say:
Let me cross!
that the men of Gil’ad would say to him:
Are you an Efratite?
He would say:
No."
Judges 12:6,"Then they would say to him:
Now say <i>“shibbolet,”</i>
and he would say <i>“sibbolet”</i>
—he did not understand how to speak correctly—
so they would grab him and slaughter him, at the Jordan crossings;
there fell from Efrayim at that time forty-two thousand."
Judges 12:7,"And Yiftah led Israel as judge for six years;
then Yiftah the Gil’adite died
and was buried in his town, [in] Gil’ad."
Judges 12:8,"After him, Ivtzan from Bet-Lehem led Israel as judge;"
Judges 12:9,"—he had thirty sons,
and thirty daughters he sent away outside,
while thirty daughters he brought for his sons from the outside—
and he led Israel as judge for seven years."
Judges 12:10,"Then Ivtzan died
and was buried in Bet-Lehem."
Judges 12:11,"After him, Elon the Zevulonite led Israel as judge,
and led Israel as judge for ten years."
Judges 12:12,"Then Elon the Zevulonite died
and was buried in Ayyalon, in the region of Zevulun."
Judges 12:13,"After him, Avdon son of Hillel the Pir’atonite led Israel as judge"
Judges 12:14,"—he had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons, riding on seventy ass-colts—
and led Israel as judge for eight years."
Judges 12:15,"Then Avdon son of Hillel the Pir’atonite died
and was buried at Pir’aton in the region of Efrayim, in the Amalekite highlands."
Judges 13:1,"The Children of Israel again did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years."
Judges 13:2,"There was a man from Tzor’a, from a Danite clan;
his name was Manoah.
Now his wife was barren, she had not given birth."
Judges 13:3,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was seen by the woman;
he said to her:
Now here,
you are barren, you have not given birth,
but you shall conceive, you shall give birth to a son."
Judges 13:4,"So-now, pray guard yourself:
do not drink wine or beer,
do not eat anything <i>tamei,</i>"
Judges 13:5,"for here, you are about to conceive, you shall give birth to a son.
A razor must not go up on his head,
for One Consecrated to God shall the lad be from the womb on;
he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines!"
Judges 13:6,"The woman came and said to her husband, saying:
A man of God came to me,
the sight of him like the sight of a messenger of God,
exceedingly awe-inspiring.
I did not ask him where he was from,
and his name he did not tell me,"
Judges 13:7,"but he said to me:
Here, you are about to conceive, you shall give birth to a son;
so-now,
do not drink wine or beer,
do not eat anything <i>tamei,</i>
for One Consecrated to God shall the lad be
from the womb until the day of his death!"
Judges 13:8,"Manoah entreated Y<small>HWH</small>, he said:
O my Lord,
as for the man of God whom you sent, pray let him come again to us
and instruct us: What are we to do for the boy who will be born?"
Judges 13:9,"God hearkened to the voice of Manoah,
and God’s messenger came again to the woman
—now she was sitting in the open-field, while her husband Manoah was not with her."
Judges 13:10,"Quickly the woman ran and told it to her husband; she said to him:
Here, he has made himself seen by me, the man who came in the day to me!"
Judges 13:11,"Manoah arose and went after his wife;
he came to the man and said to him:
Are you the man who spoke to the woman?
He said:
I am."
Judges 13:12,"Manoah said:
So-now, should your words come to pass,
what will be the rule for the boy and what-we-do for him?"
Judges 13:13,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to Manoah:
From all that I said to the woman she is to guard herself,"
Judges 13:14,"from all that goes out from the vine of wine she is not to eat,
wine and beer she must not drink,
all [things] <i>tamei</i> she must not eat;
all that I have commanded her, she is to guard."
Judges 13:15,"Manoah said to Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger:
Now let us detain you,
that we may make ready a goats’ kid for you."
Judges 13:16,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to Manoah:
If you detain me, I will not eat of your food,
but if you wish to make ready an offering-up to Y<small>HWH</small>, you should offer it up
—for Manoah did not know that he was Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger."
Judges 13:17,"Manoah said to Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger:
What is your name,
so that when your words come to pass, we may honor you?"
Judges 13:18,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to him:
Now why do you ask about my name?
For it is wondrous!"
Judges 13:19,"Manoah took the goats’ kid and the gift-offering
and offered them up on the rock to Y<small>HWH</small>.
He did wondrously, while Manoah and his wife saw it:"
Judges 13:20,"it was,
as the flame was going upward from the altar to the heavens,
that Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger went up in the flame of the altar.
When Manoah and his wife saw it,
they flung themselves upon their faces to the ground."
Judges 13:21,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was not seen again by Manoah or by his wife,
so Manoah knew that he was Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger."
Judges 13:22,"Manoah said to his wife:
We are going to die, yes, die,
for it is a god that we have seen!"
Judges 13:23,"But his wife said to him:
Had Y<small>HWH</small> desired to have us die
he would not have taken an offering-up and a grain-gift from our hand,
he would not have let us see all these,
and at that moment, he would not have let us hear such things."
Judges 13:24,"The woman gave birth to a son;
she called his name Shimshon.
The boy grew up, and Y<small>HWH</small> blessed him."
Judges 13:25,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s rushing-spirit began to stir him up in Mahaneh-Dan,
between Tzor’a and Eshtaol."
Judges 14:1,"Shimshon went down to Timna,
and he saw a woman in Timna from the daughters of the Philistines."
Judges 14:2,"He came up and told it to his father and to his mother;
he said:
A woman have I seen in Timna from the daughters of the Philistines.
So-now, take her for me as a wife!"
Judges 14:3,"His father and his mother said to him:
Is there not among your brothers’ daughters or among all my people a woman,
that you must go to take a woman from the Philistines, the Foreskinned Ones?
Shimshon said to his father:
Take <i>her</i> for me, for she is right in my eyes!"
Judges 14:4,"Now his father and his mother did not know that it was from Y<small>HWH</small>,
for he was seeking a pretext from the Philistines
—now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel."
Judges 14:5,"Shimshon went down along with his father and his mother to Timna;
they had come as far as the vineyards of Timna
when here, a full-maned roaring lion, [coming] to meet him!"
Judges 14:6,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s spirit advanced upon him
and he tore it apart as one tears apart a kid,
without a thing in his hand.
But he did not tell his father and his mother what he had done."
Judges 14:7,"Then he went down and spoke to the woman—
she was right in Shimshon’s eyes."
Judges 14:8,"He returned after a year to take her;
he turned aside to see the fallen lion,
and here: a swarm of bees in the lion’s corpse, and honey!"
Judges 14:9,"He broke it off into his hands,
and went along, going and eating.
Then he went back to his father and to his mother,
and gave some to them, and they ate.
But he did not tell them that it was from the lion’s corpse that he had broken off the honey."
Judges 14:10,"His father went down on account of the woman,
and Shimshon made a drinkfest there, for that is what young men do;"
Judges 14:11,"and it was when they saw him, that they fetched thirty feasting-companions [who] remained with him."
Judges 14:12,"Shimshon said to them:
Now let me riddle you a riddle!
If you can tell, yes, tell me its [answer] during the seven days of the drinkfest
and can find it out,
I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes;"
Judges 14:13,"but if you are not able to tell me,
you will have to give me, yourselves, thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes."
Judges 14:14,"He said to them:
Out of the eater came food-to-eat,
out of the strong one came something sweet.
They could not tell him [the answer to] the riddle for three days;"
Judges 14:15,"so on the fourth day it was that they said to Shimshon’s wife:
Seduce your husband, that he may tell us [the answer to] the riddle,
lest we burn you and your Father’s House with fire—
is it to dispossess us that you have invited us here?"
Judges 14:16,"Shimshon’s wife wept on him, she said:
You surely hate me, you do not love me;
should you riddle a riddle to the sons of my people,
and not tell [the answer] to me?
He said to her:
Here, I haven’t told it to my father or to my mother—
so should I tell it to you?"
Judges 14:17,"She wept on him for the seven days in which they held the drinkfest,
and then it was, on the seventh day, that he told it to her, for she kept pressing him,
and she told the riddle’s [answer] to the sons of her people."
Judges 14:18,"So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day, before the daystar set:
What is sweeter than honey?
What is stronger than a lion?
He said to them:
If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer,
you wouldn’t have found out my riddle!"
Judges 14:19,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s spirit advanced upon him;
he went down to Ashkelon
and struck down thirty fighting-men of them,
took their sashes
and gave them as clothing-changes to those who had told the riddle’s [answer].
His anger flared on,
and he went up to his father’s house."
Judges 14:20,"Now Shimshon’s wife was [given] to one of his feasting-companions, who had been his [own] companion."
Judges 15:1,"Now it was [after] a year, in the days of the wheat cutting,
that Shimshon visited his wife with a goats’ kid;
he said: I will come in to my wife, in the inner-room!
But her father did not give him [leave] to come in."
Judges 15:2,"Her father said:
I said [to myself], said:
Indeed, you bear hatred, yes, hatred toward her,
so I gave her to your companion.
Isn’t her sister more good-looking than she?
Let her be yours in her place!"
Judges 15:3,"Shimshon said to them:
This time I will be clear of blame from the Philistines,
if I do evil with them!"
Judges 15:4,"So Shimshon went
and captured three hundred foxes,
and took [some] torches
and faced tail to tail,
and placed each torch between two tails, in the middle,"
Judges 15:5,"and ignited fire in the torches,
and sent them free in the standing-stalks of the Philistines;
he ignited from sheaf-stacks to standing-stalks, to vineyards [and] olive-trees."
Judges 15:6,"The Philistines said:
Who has done this?
They said:
Shimshon, the Timnite’s son-in-law,
for he took away his wife and gave her to his companion!
So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire."
Judges 15:7,"Shimshon said to them:
If you do [things] like this,
surely when I have avenged myself upon you, [only] afterward will I stop!"
Judges 15:8,"And he struck them down, hip over thigh, a great striking down;
then he went down and stayed in the gorge of Etam’s Crag."
Judges 15:9,"The Philistines went up and camped in Yehuda;
they were spread out at Lehi."
Judges 15:10,"And the fighting-men of Yehuda said:
Why have you come up against us?
They said:
To bind Shimshon have we come up,
to do to him as he did to us!"
Judges 15:11,"Three thousand fighting-men from Yehuda went down to the gorge of Etam’s Crag
and said to Shimshon:
Don’t you know that the Philistines are ruling us?
Now what have you done to us?
He said to them:
As they did to me, so I did to them!"
Judges 15:12,"They said to him:
We have come down to bind you, to give you into the hand of the Philistines.
Shimshon said to them:
Swear to me, lest you attack me yourselves!"
Judges 15:13,"They said to him, saying:
No,
rather, we want to bind, yes, bind you, and give you into their hand,
but death, we will not cause your death!
So they bound him with two new ropes
and led him up from the Rock."
Judges 15:14,"He had come as far as Lehi,
when the Philistines shouted [in triumph] meeting him;
Y<small>HWH</small>’s spirit advanced upon him,
and the ropes which were on his arms became
like [threads of] flax which are ignited with fire;
his bonds melted off his hands."
Judges 15:15,"He found the fresh jawbone of a donkey
and stretched out his hand and took it,
and with it he struck down a thousand men."
Judges 15:16,"Then Shimshon said:
With the jawbone of a donkey,
one donkey, two donkeys,
with the jawbone of a donkey
I’ve struck down a thousand men!"
Judges 15:17,"It was, when he had finished speaking,
that he threw the jawbone from his hand
—so they called that place Ramat Lehi/Jawbone Height."
Judges 15:18,"He became exceedingly thirsty, so he called out to Y<small>HWH</small> and said:
You yourself have given into your servant’s hand
this great deliverance,
so-now, shall I die of thirst
and fall into the hand of the Foreskinned Ones?"
Judges 15:19,"So God split open the cavity that was at Lehi,
and water came out of it, and he drank;
his spirit returned, and he revived."
Judges 15:20,"He led Israel as judge in the days of the Philistines, for twenty years."
Judges 16:1,"Shimshon went to Gaza;
he saw there a whore woman, and came in to her."
Judges 16:2,"Among the Gazites it was said:
Shimshon has come here!
They circled about and set an ambush for him the whole night at the town gate,
and they plotted the whole night, saying:
Until the light of daybreak—then we will kill him!"
Judges 16:3,"Shimshon lay until the middle of the night;
he arose in the middle of the night
and seized the doors of the town gate, along with the two posts,
and pulled them up, together with the bolt
and put them on his shoulders
and brought them up to the top of the hill that faces Hevron."
Judges 16:4,"Now it was [some time] after this
that he fell in love with a woman in the Wadi of Sorek/Vines;
her name was Delila."
Judges 16:5,"The Philistine overlords went up to her and said to her:
Seduce him and see
whereby his might is so great,
whereby we can overcome him,
so that we can bind him, to subdue him,
and we ourselves, each one, will give you a thousand and a hundred pieces of silver!"
Judges 16:6,"Delila said to Shimshon:
Pray tell me,
whereby is your might so great,
whereby can you be bound, to subdue you?"
Judges 16:7,"Shimshon said to her:
If they were to bind me with seven fresh gut-strings, that have not been dried,
I’d become weak, I’d become like
any man!"
Judges 16:8,"The Philistine overlords brought up to her seven fresh gut-strings, that had not been dried,
and she bound him with them."
Judges 16:9,"Now the ambush was sitting for her in the inner-room.
She said to him:
Philistines upon you, Shimshon!
He snapped the strings
as hempen cord bursts when it smells fire,
and his might was not made known."
Judges 16:10,"Delila said to Shimshon:
Here, you’ve taunted me,
you’ve been speaking lies to me—
but now, pray tell me:
whereby can you be bound?"
Judges 16:11,"He said to her:
If they were to bind, yes, bind me with new ropes,
with which no work has been done,
I’d become weak, I’d become like
any man!"
Judges 16:12,"So Delila took new ropes
and bound him with them,
and said to him:
Philistines upon you, Shimshon!
—Now the ambush was sitting in the inner-room.—
He snapped them from off his arms like a thread."
Judges 16:13,"Delila said to Shimshon:
Until now you’ve taunted me,
you’ve been speaking lies to me—
tell me:
whereby can you be bound?
He said to her:
If you were to weave the seven locks of my head in a warp …"
Judges 16:14,"She drove them tight with the pin,
and said to him:
Philistines upon you, Shimshon!
He awoke from his sleep
and pulled out the pin, the weaver’s-bobbin, and the warp."
Judges 16:15,"Then she said to him:
How can you say: I love you,
when your heart is not with me?
Three times now you’ve taunted me,
yet you haven’t told me
whereby your might is so great!"
Judges 16:16,"And it was,
when she had pressed him with her words all the time
and had prodded him, so that he became short-tempered to [the point of] death,"
Judges 16:17,"that he told her all his heart;
he said to her:
No razor has gone up on my head,
for One Consecrated to God have I been from my mother’s womb on:
if I were to be shaven,
my might would leave me;"
Judges 16:18,"Delila saw that he had told her all his heart,
so she sent and called for the Philistine overlords, saying:
Come up this time,
for he has told me all his heart!
The Philistine overlords went up to her,
and they brought up the silver in their hand."
Judges 16:19,"She lulled him to sleep upon her knees,
and she called for a man and he shaved off the seven locks of his head;
she began to subdue him,
and his might left him."
Judges 16:20,"Then she said:
Philistines upon you, Shimshon!
He awoke from his sleep,
and he said [to himself]:
I’ll get away as time after time,
I’ll shake myself free!
But he did not know that Y<small>HWH</small> had left him."
Judges 16:21,"The Philistines grabbed him and gouged out his eyes;
then they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with doublebronze,
and he had to grind [grain] in the prison house."
Judges 16:22,"But the hair of his head began to sprout again, as soon as it had been shaven off."
Judges 16:23,"Now the Philistine overlords gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god
and for [a feast of] rejoicing.
They said:
Given has our god
into our hand
Shimshon our foe!"
Judges 16:24,"The people saw him
and praised their god,
indeed, they said:
Given has our god
into our hand
[Shimshon] our foe,
destroyer of our land,
who made many our slain!"
Judges 16:25,"Now it was, since their heart was in good-humor,
that they said:
Call for Shimshon, that he may provide-amusement for us!
They had Shimshon called out of the prison house,
and he provided-amusement before them.
They stood him between the standing-columns,"
Judges 16:26,"and Shimshon said to the serving-lad who held him by the hand:
Let me rest;
let me feel the columns on which the house is founded,
so that I may support myself on them!"
Judges 16:27,"Now the house was full of men and women;
all the Philistine overlords were there,
and upon the roof were about three thousand—man and woman—
who were seeing Shimshon provide-amusement."
Judges 16:28,"And Shimshon called out to Y<small>HWH</small>;
he said:
My Lord, Y<small>HWH</small>,
now be mindful of me,
now strengthen me,
just this one time;
O God,
I would take revenge, a single revenge for my two eyes
from the Philistines!"
Judges 16:29,"Shimshon clasped the two middle columns on which the house was founded;
he put-his-weight on them,
one with his right [hand], and one with his left,"
Judges 16:30,"and Shimshon said:
Let me die with the Philistines!
He inclined with might,
and the house fell down on the overlords,
on all the people who were in it.
Now the dead whose death he caused at his death
were more than those whose death he had caused in his life."
Judges 16:31,"His brothers and all his Father’s House went down,
they lifted him, brought him up and buried him
between Tzor’a and Eshtaol, in the burial place of Manoah his father.
Now he had led Israel as judge for twenty years."
Judges 17:1,"There was a man from the highlands of Efrayim;
his name was Mikhayehu."
Judges 17:2,"[Once] he said to his mother:
The thousand and a hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you,
and you yourself put an oath-curse [on it], and even said it in my hearing—
here, the silver is with me,
I myself took it!
His mother said:
Blessed is my son of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Judges 17:3,"He has returned the thousand and a hundred pieces of silver to his mother!
And his mother said:
I render the silver holy, yes, holy to Y<small>HWH</small>,
from my hand, for my son,
to make a carved and molten [idol].
So-now, I return it to you."
Judges 17:4,"He returned the silver to his mother,
and his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave it to a smelter;
he made it into a carved and molten [idol],
and it remained in the house of Mikhayehu."
Judges 17:5,"Now the man Mikha had a house of God;
he had made an <i>efod</i> and <i>terafim</i>
and had given-mandate to one of his sons, so that he had become a priest for him."
Judges 17:6,"In those days, there was no king in Israel;
each one would do what was right in his eyes."
Judges 17:7,"There was a lad from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda, from a clan of Yehuda
—now he was a Levite, and he was sojourning there."
Judges 17:8,"And the man went from the town, from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda to sojourn wherever he could find,
and he came to the highlands of Efrayim, to the house of Mikha, to make his way."
Judges 17:9,"Mikha said to him:
From where have you come?
He said to him:
I am a Levite,
from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda,
and I am going to sojourn wherever I can find."
Judges 17:10,"Mikha said to him:
Come stay with me, and be for me a “father” and a priest,
and I myself will give you ten pieces of silver a year, an outfit of garments, and your living needs.
So the Levite went;"
Judges 17:11,"the Levite agreed to settle with the man,
and the lad became for him like one of his sons."
Judges 17:12,"Mikha gave-mandate to the Levite,
and the lad became a priest for him
and remained in Mikha’s house."
Judges 17:13,"Mikha said:
Now I know
that Y<small>HWH</small> will do good for me,
for a Levite has become a priest for me!"
Judges 18:1,"In those days, there was no king in Israel.
And in those days, the Danite tribe was seeking for itself a hereditary-property to settle in,
for there had not fallen [any land] to it until that day among the tribes of Israel as a hereditary-property."
Judges 18:2,"So the Children of Dan sent from their clan five men from [all] their quarters, valiant men from Tzor’a and from Eshtaol,
to spy out the region and to explore it.
They said to them:
Go, explore the region!
So they came to the highlands of Efrayim, to the house of Mikha,
that they might spend the night there."
Judges 18:3,"They were near the house of Mikha
when they recognized the voice of the Levite lad,
so they turned aside there and said to him:
Who brought you here?
And what are you doing in this [place]? And what [business] do you have here?"
Judges 18:4,"He said to them:
Like this and like that has Mikha done for me;
he has hired me, and so I have become a priest for him."
Judges 18:5,"They said to him:
Pray inquire of God,
that we may know whether it will succeed, our way on which we are going."
Judges 18:6,"The priest said to them:
Go in peace—
straight before Y<small>HWH</small> is your way on which you are going!"
Judges 18:7,"So the five men went and came to Layish,
and they saw the men who were in its midst, settled in security in the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure,
with no one humiliating anyone in the region [or] barring an heir;
they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone."
Judges 18:8,"They came back to their brothers in Tzor’a and Eshtaol,
and their brothers said to them:
What do you [think]?"
Judges 18:9,"They said:
Arise and let us go up against them,
for we have seen the region, and here, it is exceedingly good.
But you are silent—
do not be sluggish to go, to enter and take possession of the region!"
Judges 18:10,"When you come [there], you will be coming to a people feeling-secure,
while the region is as broad as [outstretched] hands;
indeed, God will give it into your hands,
a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the region."
Judges 18:11,"So they marched from there, from the Danite clan, from Tzor’a and from Eshtaol,
six hundred men, girded in battle gear,"
Judges 18:12,"and they went up and encamped at Kiryat-Ye’arim, in Yehuda
—therefore they called that place Camp of Dan, until this day;
here, it is behind Kiryat-Ye’arim."
Judges 18:13,"They crossed through the highlands of Efrayim from there
and came as far as the house of Mikha;"
Judges 18:14,"then the five men spoke up, the ones going to spy out the region of Layish,
and said to their brothers:
Do you know that there are in these houses an <i>efod</i> and <i>terafim,</i>
and a carved and molten [idol]?
Now, know what you must do!"
Judges 18:15,"So they turned aside there and came to the house of the Levite lad, the house of Mikha,
and inquired after his welfare."
Judges 18:16,"Now six hundred men girded in battle gear were standing at the entrance to the gate, the ones from the Children of Dan,"
Judges 18:17,"while the five men going to spy out the region went up and they came there
[and] took the carved-image, the <i>efod,</i> the <i>terafim,</i> and the molten-image,
while the priest was standing at the entrance to the gate,
along with the six hundred men girded in battle gear."
Judges 18:18,"When these came to the house of Mikha and took the carved <i>efod,</i> the <i>terafim,</i> and the molten-image,
the priest said to them:
What are you doing?"
Judges 18:19,"They said to him:
Be still!
Put your hand over your mouth, and go with us,
and become a “father” and a priest for us!
Is it better, your being a priest for the house of one man,
or your being a priest for a tribe and a clan in Israel?"
Judges 18:20,"The heart of the priest was disposed-for-good,
so he took the <i>efod,</i> the <i>terafim,</i> and the carved-image, and came amid the fighting-people;"
Judges 18:21,"they faced about and went off,
and put the families and the livestock and the weighty-wealth in front of them."
Judges 18:22,"They had gone far from the house of Mikha
when the men who were in the houses that were near Mikha’s house mustered themselves and caught up with the Children of Dan;"
Judges 18:23,"they called out to the Children of Dan, and they turned their faces and said to Mikha:
What [ails] you, that you have mustered yourself?"
Judges 18:24,"He said:
My gods that I made, you have taken, along with the priest, and you have gone off!
What do I have anymore?
So why, now, do you say to me: What [ails] you?"
Judges 18:25,"The Children of Dan said to him:
Don’t make your voice heard among us,
lest men of bitter feelings attack you
and you have to lose your life-breath and the life-breath of your household!"
Judges 18:26,"So the Children of Dan went on their way;
and Mikha saw that they were stronger than he,
so he faced about and returned to his house."
Judges 18:27,"Now they took what Mikha had made and the priest that he had,
and came against Layish,
against a people quiet and secure,
and struck them with the mouth of the sword,
while the town they burned with fire."
Judges 18:28,"Now there was no rescuer, for it was far from Sidon,
and they had no dealings with anyone;
it was in the valley that belongs to Bet-Rehov.
They rebuilt the town and settled in it,"
Judges 18:29,"and they called the name of the town Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestral-father, who had been born to Yisrael;
however, Layish was the name of the town in former times."
Judges 18:30,"And the Children of Dan erected the carved-image for themselves,
while Yehonatan son of Gershom son of Moshe, he and his sons were priests for the Danite tribe, until the time of the exile of the land;"
Judges 18:31,"they set up for themselves the carved-image of Mikha which he had made, all the days that the house of God was at Shilo."
Judges 19:1,"Now it was in those days,
when king there was none in Israel:
there was a Levite man, sojourning on the flanks of the highlands of Efrayim.
He took himself a concubine woman, from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda."
Judges 19:2,"But his concubine whored against him;
she went from him to her father’s house, to Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda,
and she remained there for a period of four months."
Judges 19:3,"And her husband arose and went after her,
to speak to her heart, to have her return
—his serving-lad was with him, along with a brace of donkeys.
She brought him into her father’s house,
and when the girl’s father saw him,
he rejoiced meeting him;"
Judges 19:4,"his father-in-law, the girl’s father, prevailed upon him,
so that he stayed with him for three days,
and they ate and drank and spent the night there."
Judges 19:5,"Now it was on the fourth day
that they started-early in the morning, and arose to go,
but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law:
Refresh your heart with a bit of bread;
afterward you may go!"
Judges 19:6,"So they stayed and ate, the two of them together, and they drank.
And the girl’s father said to the man:
Now consent to spend the night, so that your heart may be in good-humor!"
Judges 19:7,"The man arose to go,
but his father-in-law pressed him,
so that [once] again he spent the night there."
Judges 19:8,"He started early on the morning of the fifth day to go,
but the girl’s father said:
Now refresh your heart
and tarry until the lengthening of the day!
So the two of them ate."
Judges 19:9,"Then the man arose to go, he and his concubine and his serving-lad,
but his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him:
Here now, the day is weakening toward sunset;
now spend the night,
[for] here, the day is declining!
Spend the night here, so that your heart may be in good-humor;
you may start early on the morrow on your way, so that you may go back to your tent."
Judges 19:10,"But the man would not spend the night;
he arose and went and arrived at [a place] in front of Yevus—that is Jerusalem—and with him was a brace of loaded donkeys,
and his concubine was with him."
Judges 19:11,"They were near Yevus, and the day was exceedingly low,
so the serving-lad said to his lord:
Come now, let us turn aside to this Yevusite town and spend the night in it!"
Judges 19:12,"But his lord said to him:
We will not turn aside to a foreign town
in which none of the Children of Israel are here;
we will cross over as far as Giv’a."
Judges 19:13,"And he said to his serving-lad:
Come, let us go near one of the places
and spend the night in Giv’a or in Rama."
Judges 19:14,"So they crossed over and went,
and the sun came in on them alongside Giv’a, which belongs to Binyamin."
Judges 19:15,"They turned aside there, to come in to spend the night in Giv’a,
and they came and sat in the town square,
but no one was gathering them into the house to spend the night."
Judges 19:16,"Now here, an old man came in from his work, from the fields, at sunset
—the man was from the highlands of Efrayim, and he was sojourning in Giv’a,
while the men of the place were Binyaminites—"
Judges 19:17,"and he lifted up his eyes and saw the man, the wayfarer, in the town square;
the old man said:
Where are you going, and from where do you come?"
Judges 19:18,"He said to him:
We are crossing from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda as far as the flanks of the highlands of Efrayim
—I am from there;
I went to Bet-Lehem in Yehuda,
and to my house I am going back,
but no one will gather me into the house!"
Judges 19:19,"Yes, there is straw, yes, fodder for our donkeys, and yes, there are bread and wine for me and for your handmaid and for the serving-lad with your servants;
there is no lack of anything."
Judges 19:20,"The old man said:
Peace be to you!
Surely whatever you lack shall be on me,
for sure do not spend the night in the square!"
Judges 19:21,"He brought him into his house
and provided for the donkeys;
they washed their feet
and ate and drank."
Judges 19:22,"They were putting their hearts in good-humor
when here, the men of the city, base men, encircled the house;
they kept on beating against the door
and said to the man, the old house owner, saying:
Bring out the man who came into your house—
we want to know him!"
Judges 19:23,"But the man, the house owner, went out to them and said to them:
No, my brothers! Do not do evil, now!
Since this man came into my house,
do not do this vile thing!"
Judges 19:24,"Here are my nubile daughter and his concubine;
now let me bring them out—force them or do to them whatever is good in your eyes,
but to this man, do not do this vile thing!"
Judges 19:25,"But the men would not hearken to him,
so the man took hold of his concubine and pushed [her] out to them, outside,
and they knew her and abused her all night, until daybreak;
then they sent her away when the dawn came up."
Judges 19:26,"The woman came back toward daybreak
and fell down at the entrance of the house of the man where her lord was,
until [it was] light."
Judges 19:27,"Her lord arose at daybreak;
he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way—"
Judges 19:28,"He said to her:
Get up, let’s go!
But no one was answering.
So he took her up on the donkey,
and the man arose and went back to his place."
Judges 19:29,"He came to his house
and took a knife
and lay hold of his concubine
and chopped her up, into her limbs, into twelve chopped-pieces,
and sent her off throughout all the territory of Israel."
Judges 19:30,"And it was that all who saw it would say:
Never has there been, never has been seen [anything] like this
from the day of the Children of Israel’s going up from the land of Egypt until this day!
Take it [seriously] for yourselves, get counsel, and speak out!"
Judges 20:1,"So the Children of Israel went out
and the community assembled as one man, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva, including the land of Gil’ad, to Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa."
Judges 20:2,"And the “cornerstones” of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, stood forth,
in the assembly of the people of God,
four hundred thousand fighting-men, foot-soldiers drawing the sword."
Judges 20:3,"And the Children of Binyamin heard that the Children of Israel had gone up to Mitzpa.
The Children of Israel said:
Speak:
how did this evil come to be?"
Judges 20:4,"Then answered the Levite man, the husband of the murdered woman;
he said:
To Giv’a, which is in Binyamin, I came, I and my concubine, to spend the night,"
Judges 20:5,"but the landowners of Giv’a arose against me
and encircled the house against me at night;
me they intended to kill,
and my concubine they forced, so that she died."
Judges 20:6,"And so I grabbed my concubine,
I chopped her up
and sent her off throughout all the open-country of Israel’s hereditary-property,
for they did a lewd and vile [thing] in Israel!"
Judges 20:7,"Here, all of you, O Children of Israel:
give yourselves word and advice here!"
Judges 20:8,"And all the people arose as one man, saying:
We will not go back, anyone to his tent,
nor will we turn aside, anyone to his house!"
Judges 20:9,"Now: this is the thing that we will do to Giv’a:
[Go] against it by lot!"
Judges 20:10,"We will take ten men per hundred, for all the tribes of Israel,
and a hundred per thousand, and a thousand per myriad,
taking provisions for the fighting-people, to make ready to go against Giv’a of Binyamin,
in accordance with all the vileness that they have done in Israel!"
Judges 20:11,"So all the fighting-men of Israel gathered together against the town, as one man, confederates."
Judges 20:12,"And the tribes of Israel sent men among the entire tribe of Binyamin, saying:
What is this evil that came-about among you?"
Judges 20:13,"So-now, give over the men, the base ones, who are in Giv’a, that we may put them to death,
that we may eradicate evil from Israel!
But the Children of Binyamin would not hearken to the voice of their brothers, the Children of Israel,"
Judges 20:14,"and the Children of Binyamin gathered together from the towns to Giv’a
to go out for battle with the Children of Israel."
Judges 20:15,"And the Children of Binyamin were counted-for-war on that day, from the towns:
twenty-six thousand fighting-men drawing the sword;
aside from the settled-folk of Giv’a, seven hundred chosen men were counted,"
Judges 20:16,"from all these fighting-people, seven hundred chosen men, restricted in their right hand;
each of these could sling a stone at a hair and not miss."
Judges 20:17,"Now the fighting-men of Israel were counted, aside from Binyamin:
four hundred thousand men drawing the sword,
each of these a man of battle."
Judges 20:18,"They arose and went up to Bet-El, and inquired of God;
the Children of Israel said:
Who will go up for us first in battle with the Children of Binyamin?
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Yehuda first."
Judges 20:19,"The Children of Israel arose at daybreak
and encamped against Giv’a."
Judges 20:20,"And the fighting-men of Israel went out to battle with Binyamin;
the men of Israel arranged their ranks with them for battle at Giv’a."
Judges 20:21,"And the Children of Binyamin went out from Giv’a;
on that day they brought to ruin among Israel: twenty-two thousand men to the ground."
Judges 20:22,"But the fighting-people, the men of Israel, strengthened themselves,
and they again arranged ranks for battle
in the place where they had arranged [them] on the first day."
Judges 20:23,"And the Children of Israel went up
and wept in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, until sunset;
they inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Shall I again approach for battle with the Children of Binyamin my brother?
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Go up against him."
Judges 20:24,"So the Children of Israel drew near to the Children of Binyamin on the second day,"
Judges 20:25,"and when Binyamin went out to meet them from Giv’a on the second day,
they brought to ruin among the Children of Israel another eighteen thousand men, to the ground,
all of these drawing the sword."
Judges 20:26,"Then all the Children of Israel went up, and all the fighting-people,
and came to Bet-El;
they wept and sat there, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and they fasted on that day until sunset
and offered up offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Judges 20:27,"And the Children of Israel inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>
—now the Coffer of God’s Covenant was there in those days,"
Judges 20:28,"and Pin’has son of El’azar son of Aharon was standing [in attendance] before it in those days—
saying:
Shall I once again go out for battle with the Children of Binyamin my brother,
or shall I hold back?
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Go up,
for on the morrow I will give him into your hand!"
Judges 20:29,So Israel set ambushes against Giv’a all around.
Judges 20:30,"And the Children of Israel went up against the Children of Binyamin on the third day,
and arranged-ranks against Giv’a as time and time [before];"
Judges 20:31,"and when the Children of Binyamin went out to meet the fighting-people,
they were torn away from the town
and began to strike down some of the people, [leaving] slain as time and time [before] on the highways
—of which one goes up to Bet-El and one to Giv’a, in the open-country—
about thirty men in Israel."
Judges 20:32,"The Children of Binyamin said:
They are beaten before us, as at the beginning!
But the Children of Israel said:
Let us flee and tear them away from the town, onto the highways!"
Judges 20:33,"Now when all the fighting-men of Israel had risen from their place
and had arranged-ranks at Baal Tamar,
the ambush of Israel burst forth from its place, from the Giv’a Cave,"
Judges 20:34,"while from opposite Giv’a came ten thousand men, chosen ones from all Israel.
Now the battle was heavy,
but they did not know that evil-fortune was [already] reaching them."
Judges 20:35,"So Y<small>HWH</small> defeated Binyamin before Israel,
and the Children of Israel brought to ruin among the Children of Binyamin on that day
twenty-five thousand and a hundred men,
all of these drawing the sword."
Judges 20:36,"The Children of Binyamin saw that they were defeated,
and the fighting-men of Israel gave ground to Binyamin,
for they were secure regarding the ambush that they had set at Giv’a."
Judges 20:37,"Now the ambush they hurried along and spread out against Giv’a,
and the ambush drew out
and struck the entire city with the mouth of the sword."
Judges 20:38,"Now the arrangement for the men of Israel with the ambush had been
to send up a rising-mass of smoke from the city;"
Judges 20:39,"then the men of Israel were to turn around in battle.
And Binyamin had begun to strike, [leaving] slain among Israel about thirty men;
indeed, they said:
Surely, he is defeated, yes, defeated before us, as in the beginning battle!"
Judges 20:40,"But the rising-mass began to go up from the town—a column of smoke;
Binyamin faced about behind him
and here, the whole of the town went up [in smoke] to the heavens!"
Judges 20:41,"The men of Israel turned around,
and the men of Binyamin were terrified,
for they saw that evil-fortune was reaching them."
Judges 20:42,"So they faced about before the men of Israel toward the way of the wilderness,
but the battle caught up with them;
whoever was from the town, they brought him to ruin in its midst:"
Judges 20:43,"they encircled Binyamin and they pursued him
—to Menuha they forced him along—
up to [a spot] opposite Giv’a, toward the rising of the sun."
Judges 20:44,"And there fell of Binyamin eighteen thousand men,
all these, men of valor."
Judges 20:45,"They faced about and fled to the wilderness, to the Rimmon Crag,
but they picked them off on the highways,
five thousand men;
they caught up with them as far as Gid’om/Hewing Them,
and struck down from them two thousand men."
Judges 20:46,"And all those who fell from Binyamin were twenty-five thousand men drawing the sword on that day,
all these, men of valor."
Judges 20:47,"They faced about and fled to the wilderness, to the Rimmon Crag: six hundred men,
and they stayed at the Rimmon Crag for four months."
Judges 20:48,"Now the men of Israel returned to the Children of Binyamin and struck them with the mouth of the sword,
from the men of the town to the cattle and to all that was found,
and also all the towns that were found they sent up in fire."
Judges 21:1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mitzpa, saying:
Let no man among us give his daughter to Binyamin as a wife!"
Judges 21:2,"And the fighting-people came to Bet-El,
and sat there until sunset, in the presence of God;
they lifted up their voices and wept, a great weeping,"
Judges 21:3,"and they said:
Why, O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel, did this happen in Israel,
for one tribe to be accounted [missing] today from Israel?"
Judges 21:4,"So it was on the morrow that the people started early
and built a sacrificial-altar there,
and they offered up offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
Judges 21:5,"And the Children of Israel said:
Who is it that did not go up among the assembly from all the tribes of Israel to Y<small>HWH</small>?
For the great sworn-oath was against anyone who did not go up to Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa, saying:
He shall be put to death, yes, death!"
Judges 21:6,"And the Children of Israel felt regret toward Binyamin their brother;
they said:
Hewn off today is one tribe from Israel!"
Judges 21:7,"What can we do for them, for those left, regarding wives?
For we ourselves have sworn by Y<small>HWH</small>
not to give them any of our daughters as wives!"
Judges 21:8,"And they said:
Which is the one from the tribes of Israel that did not go up to Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa?
Now here, not a man had come to the camp from Yavesh-Gil’ad, to the assembly."
Judges 21:9,"The people were counted,
and here, there was not a man there from the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad."
Judges 21:10,"So the community sent there twelve thousand men of the valiant ones,
and they charged them, saying:
Go and strike down the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad with the mouth of the sword,
along with the women and the little-ones!"
Judges 21:11,"And this is the thing that you are to do:
every male, and every woman [who] has known lying with a male, you are to devote-to-destruction."
Judges 21:12,"They found among the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad four hundred nubile girls
who had not known a man by lying with a male,
and they brought them to the camp at Shilo, which is in the land of Canaan."
Judges 21:13,"And the entire community sent
and spoke to the Children of Binyamin who were at Rimmon Crag;
they called out to them: Peace!"
Judges 21:14,"So the Children of Binyamin returned at that time,
and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive among the women of Yavesh-Gil’ad;
but they did not find enough for them thus."
Judges 21:15,"Now the people had felt regret toward Binyamin,
since Y<small>HWH</small> had made a breach among the tribes of Israel,"
Judges 21:16,"so the elders of the community said:
What are we to do with those left, for wives?
—for [the] women were wiped out from Binyamin!"
Judges 21:17,"They said:
[There must be] a surviving possession for Binyamin,
so that a tribe in Israel not be wiped out!"
Judges 21:18,"Now as for us, we are not able to give them wives from our daughters,
—for the Children of Israel had sworn, saying:
Doomed be the one giving a wife to Binyamin!—"
Judges 21:19,"so they said:
Here, there is the pilgrimage-festival of Y<small>HWH</small> at Shilo—year after year—
that is north of Bet-El, toward the rising of the sun from the highway that goes up from Bet-El to Shekhem, and south of Levona."
Judges 21:20,"So they charged the Children of Binyamin, saying:
Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,"
Judges 21:21,"and see: here, if the daughters of Shilo go out to dance in the dances,
you are to go out from the vineyards
and are to catch for yourselves, each one, his wife from the daughters of Shilo;
then you may go back to the land of Binyamin."
Judges 21:22,"So it will be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us
that we will say to them:
Be gracious to them,
for haven’t we taken, each one, his wife in battle?
For if you yourselves had given [them] to them,
[then] at that time you would have incurred-guilt."
Judges 21:23,"So the Children of Binyamin did thus:
they took up wives according to their number
from the dancers whom they kidnapped;
then they went and returned to their hereditary-property
and rebuilt the towns, and settled in them."
Judges 21:24,"And the Children of Israel went off from there at that time,
each one to his tribe and to his clan,
and each one went out from there to his hereditary-property."
Judges 21:25,"In those days, there was no king in Israel;
each one would do what was right in his eyes."
