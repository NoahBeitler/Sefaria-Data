Judges 1:1,"Now it was after the death of Yehoshua
that the Children of Israel inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Who among us will go up first against the Canaanites to wage battle against them?"
Judges 1:2,"Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Yehuda will go up;
here, I have given the land into his hand."
Judges 1:3,"Yehuda said to Shim’on his brother-tribe:
Go up with me into my allotted-territory, and let us wage battle against the Canaanites,
and I will go with you as well into your allotted-territory.
So Shim’on went with him."
Judges 1:4,"Yehuda went up,
and Y<small>HWH</small> gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand,
so that they struck them down in Bezek,
ten thousand men."
Judges 1:5,"They found Adoni-Vezek in Bezek, and waged battle against him,
and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites."
Judges 1:6,"And Adoni-Vezek fled, so they pursued after him,
and they seized him and chopped off the thumbs of his hands and of his feet."
Judges 1:7,"Adoni-Vezek said:
Seventy kings, the thumbs of their hands and of their feet chopped off,
used to gather [crumbs] under my table;
as I did, so has God paid me back!
They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there."
Judges 1:8,"Then the Children of Yehuda waged battle against Jerusalem:
they captured it, they struck it with the mouth of the sword,
and the city they sent up in fire."
Judges 1:9,"Afterward, the Children of Yehuda went down to wage battle against the Canaanites,
those settled in the highlands, the Negev, and the lowlands."
Judges 1:10,"And Yehuda went against the Canaanites, the ones settled in Hevron,
—now the name of Hevron in former times was Kiryat-Arba—
and he struck Sheishai and Ahiman and Talmai."
Judges 1:11,"He went from there against those settled in Devir
—now the name of Devir in former times was Kiryat-Sefer."
Judges 1:12,"Now Calev said:
Whoever strikes Kiryat-Sefer and captures it,
I will give him Akhsa my daughter as a wife!"
Judges 1:13,"Otniel son of Kenaz captured it,
a brother of Calev younger than he,
and he gave him Akhsa his daughter as a wife."
Judges 1:14,"Now it was, when she came,
that she induced him to request fielded-property from her father.
She alighted from on the donkey,
and Calev said to her:
What [ails] you?"
Judges 1:15,"She said to him:
Get me a blessing-gift,
for you have given me arid land—
you should give me pools of water!
So Calev gave her the Upper Pools and the Lower Pools."
Judges 1:16,"Now the Children of the Kenite, Moshe’s father-in-law, went up from the Town of Date-Palms, along with the Children of Yehuda,
into the Wilderness of Yehuda that is south of Arad;
they went and settled with the people."
Judges 1:17,"And Yehuda went with Shim’on his brother;
they struck the Canaanites settled in Tzefat, and devoted-it-to-destruction,
so they called the name of the town Horma/Destruction."
Judges 1:18,"Then Yehuda captured Gaza and its territory
and Ashkelon and its territory
and Ekron and its territory."
Judges 1:19,"Now Y<small>HWH</small> was with Yehuda, so that he took possession of the highlands,
but he was not [able] to dispossess the settled-folk of the valley,

and he dispossessed the three sons of Anak from there."

the Yevusites are settled along with the Children of Binyamin in Jerusalem until this day."
Judges 1:22,"Now the house of Yosef went up, they too, to Bet-El,
and Y<small>HWH</small> was with them."
Judges 1:23,"The house of Yosef scouted out Bet-El
—now the name of the town in former times was Luz—"
Judges 1:24,"and the watchmen saw a man going out of the town,
so they said to him:
Pray let us see the way to enter the town, and we will show you loyalty."
Judges 1:25,"He let them see the way to enter the town, and they struck the city with the mouth of the sword,
but the man and his entire clan they sent free."
Judges 1:26,"The man went to the land of the Hittites and built a town;
he called its name Luz
—that is its name until this day."
Judges 1:27,"Menashe did not take possession of Bet-She’an and her daughter-towns,
or of Ta’nakh and her daughter-towns,
or of the settled-folk of Dor and her daughter-towns,
or of the settled-folk of Yivle’am and her daughter-towns,
or of the settled-folk of Megiddo and her daughter-towns;
the Canaanites were determined to remain settled in this region."
Judges 1:28,"And it was, when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites under forced-labor,
but dispossess, they did not dispossess them."
Judges 1:29,"Now Efrayim did not dispossess the Canaanites, those settled in Gezer,
and so the Canaanites remained settled in their midst, in Gezer."

and so the Canaanites remained settled in their midst,
and went into forced-labor."

or of Ahlav, or of Akhziv, or of Helba,
or of Afik, or of Rehov."
Judges 1:32,"So the Asherites settled amid the Canaanites, the settled-folk of the land,
for they did not dispossess them."
Judges 1:33,"Naftali did not dispossess the settled-folk of Bet-Shemesh
or the settled-folk of Bet-Anat,
so they settled amid the Canaanites, the settled-folk of the land,
and the settled-folk of Bet-Shemesh and of Bet-Anat went into forced-labor for them."
Judges 1:34,"And the Amorites pressed the Children of Dan into the highlands,
indeed, they did not give them [leave] to go down into the valley."
Judges 1:35,"The Amorites persisted in remaining settled in Mount Heres, in Ayyalon and in Shaalvim,
yet the hand of the House of Yosef grew heavy [against them], so that they went into forced-labor."
Judges 1:36,"Now the territory of the Amorites was from Scorpions’ Pass, to the Crag and further.

The Pattern: Having made the transition from Joshua in Chap. 1, the book proper begins with a harsh message from God: Israel will not occupy the land exclusively, and this means that they will have to deal somehow with the “foreign gods” worshipped by the local population. What ensues is a causational view of history, seeking to explain what happened to the Israelites and why. It begins as the book of Exodus did, with a new generation that has forgotten the past (in Exod. 1:8, it was the Pharaoh who was thus described). The text proceeds to lay out a pattern which will serve as a general outline for what is to follow. The elements are: (1) The Israelites “abandon” God by worshipping local gods (vv.11–13); (2) God reacts in anger, abandoning them to the power of their enemies and leading them to be distraught (14–15); (3) God has pity on them and sends a “judge,” almost always a military leader, who delivers them (16, 18); over time, they rebel against God again, starting the cycle once more (17, 19); this leads to a reprise of God’s anger (20–23) and his decision to leave the Canaanites in the land as a permanent test among the Israelites.
This very negative scheme would seem to lock the entire book into an ironclad pattern, but the skill of the authors and compilers varies it constantly and introduces other themes as well. And typically for the Bible, the presence of a global view does not detract from the text’s ability to portray intriguing situations and memorable characters.
In the second half of the chapter, the recurrence of central words points to the key issues, as frequently happens in biblical texts. From vv.11–14, there is a chiastic (ring) structural pattern, created by the brackets of “served … abandoned” and “abandoned … served.” Six times toward the end of the chapter, the word “hand” echoes, indicating that the crucial question is one of power: Which group will control the land?"
Judges 3:1,"A messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> went up from Gilgal to Bokhim
and said:
I had you go up from Egypt,
and I brought you to the land that I swore to your fathers;
I said:
I will not annul my covenant with you for the ages!"
Judges 3:2,"While you,
you are not to cut a covenant with the settled-folk of this land—
their altars you are to demolish!
But you did not hearken to my voice.
Now what have you done!"
Judges 3:3,"So I also say:
I will not drive them out before you;
they will be traps to you,
and their gods will be a snare to you!"
Judges 3:4,"It was, when the messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken these words to all the Children of Israel,
that the people lifted up their voice and wept."
Judges 3:5,"So they called the name of that place Bokhim/Weepers,
and they sacrificed there to Y<small>HWH</small>."
Judges 3:6,"Yehoshua had sent the fighting-people off,
and the Children of Israel had gone off, each one to his hereditary-property, to take possession of the land."
Judges 3:7,"And the people had served Y<small>HWH</small> all the days of Yehoshua
and all the days of the elders who had prolonged years after Yehoshua,
who had seen every great deed of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had done for Israel."
Judges 3:8,"And Yehoshua son of Nun, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had died, a hundred and ten years old;"
Judges 3:9,"they had buried him in the territory of his hereditary-property, in Timnat-Heres in the highlands of Efrayim, north of the highlands of Gaash."
Judges 3:10,"Now also that entire generation was gathered to its fathers,
and another generation arose after them, that did not know Y<small>HWH</small>,
as well as the deed[s] that he had done for Israel."
Judges 3:11,"And the Children of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:
they served the Baals,"
Judges 3:12,"they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of their fathers,
the one who brought them out of the land of Egypt,
and they walked after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them;
they bowed down to them
and so provoked Y<small>HWH</small>—"
Judges 3:13,"they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small>
and served Baal and the Astartes."
Judges 3:14,"So Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against Israel,
and he gave them into the hand of pillagers, so that they pillaged them,
and sold them into the hand of their enemies round about,
so that they were no longer able to stand up before their enemies."
Judges 3:15,"Whenever they went out [to war], the hand of Y<small>HWH</small> was against them for evil,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had promised,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had sworn to them,
and they were exceedingly distressed."
Judges 3:16,"Then Y<small>HWH</small> raised up judge-leaders;
they delivered them from the hand of their plunderers."
Judges 3:17,"But also to their judges they did not hearken:
indeed, they went whoring after other gods
and bowed down to them;
they quickly turned aside from the way that their fathers had walked, hearkening to the commands of Y<small>HWH</small>—
they did not do thus."
Judges 3:18,"Now whenever Y<small>HWH</small> raised up judges for them,
Y<small>HWH</small> would be with the judge,
and would deliver them from the hand of their enemies
all the days of the judge,
for Y<small>HWH</small> would feel regret at their moanings, because of their oppressors and their persecutors."
Judges 3:19,"But it would be, upon the death of the judge:
they would return and do ruin, more than their fathers,
by walking after other gods,
by serving them and by bowing down to them;
they would not let any of their actions or their stubborn path fall away."
Judges 3:20,"So Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against Israel,
and he said:
Because this nation has crossed my covenant that I commanded their fathers,
and has not hearkened to my voice,"
Judges 3:21,"for my part, I will not continue to dispossess any before them
from the nations that Yehoshua left behind when he died—"
Judges 3:22,"in order to test Israel through them,
whether they will keep the way of Y<small>HWH</small>, to walk in it,
as their fathers kept, or not.

Judges 4:1,"<b>messenger:</b> This is the actual meaning of Heb. <i>mal’akh.</i> Even the traditional rendering “angel” does not necessarily imply a supernatural creature, as the English word itself reflects the Greek <i>angelos,</i> “messenger,” human or otherwise. <b>Gilgal:</b> An important political and cultic center, near Jericho. The name seems to indicate some kind of circular structure, of stones, perhaps a platform (Rainey/Notley). <b>Bokhim:</b> The name is interpreted in v.5, below. Gray (986) raises the possibility that this refers to the “Oak of Weeping” of Gen. 35:8, which may originally reflect a Canaanite mourning or fasting ritual."
Judges 4:2,"<b>cut a covenant:</b> The expression derives from the idea of cutting up sacrificial animals, to imply that one who violates the agreement will wind up like them. See Gen. 15. <b>altars:</b> Where sacrifices were offered up. Pulling down pagan altars is an important covenant theme in Deuteronomy, and again in Kings."
Judges 4:3,"<b>traps:</b> Heb. unclear; <b>Josh.</b> 2:1 suggests that <i>tziddim</i> (“sides”) here may be short for “a whip in your sides” (Kimhi). <b>snare:</b> A trap for catching birds, and, more figuratively, foolish, wicked, or simply unwary human beings."
Judges 4:4,"<b>wept:</b> As they will do at the end of the book, in 21:2 (Boling 1975)."
Judges 4:5,"<b>prolonged years:</b> I.e., survived (Moore)."
Judges 4:6,"<b>a hundred and ten:</b> An ideal life span, as in the case of Yosef (Joseph) in Gen. 50:22."
Judges 4:7,"<b>Timnat-Heres:</b> In Josh. 1:50 and 24:30, it is spelled “Timnat-Serah.”"
Judges 4:8,"<b>the Children of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> This phrase acts as a unifying refrain in the stories about the judges, occurring seven times in Chaps. 2–3. <b>Baals:</b> The use of the plural here probably refers to the multiple forms and manifestations of the god in Canaanite worship. Baal (“master” or “lord”; pronounced <i>BAH-ahl</i>) was the powerful thunderstorm/fertility god of the area, whose mythic exploits are preserved on clay tablets from the ancient city of Ugarit on the Syrian coast, fifteenth–thirteenth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small> Judges and Samuel give evidence of the strong attraction of this Canaanite god for Israelite farmers. Some of Y<small>HWH</small>’s characteristics echo Baal’s; both, for example, are referred to in their respective literatures as “Rider on the Clouds.”"
Judges 4:9,<b>provoked:</b> Or “exasperated” (Moore).
Judges 4:10,"<b>Astartes:</b> Heb. <i>Ashtarot,</i> goddesses usually identified with well-known divine figures such as the Babylonian Ishtar. Here the plural is probably meant to include various local goddesses."
Judges 4:11,"<b>sold them:</b> A more figurative way of expressing “handed them over,” possibly also connoting finality or legitimacy associated with the concept of a sale. Conversely, physically “handing over” something can symbolically indicate the performance of an actual sale (see Ruth 4:7)."
Judges 4:12,"<b>they were exceedingly distressed:</b> Or, with LXX, “he (God) afflicted them” (Soggin)."
Judges 4:13,"<b>judge-leaders:</b> As noted in the Commentary, <i>shafat</i> often means “to lead” or “to govern”; I have sought to retain both senses, at least this first time. See the passage in 3:10, below."
Judges 4:14,<b>went whoring after:</b> A common biblical expression for idolatry. <b>thus:</b> Follow God’s commands.
Judges 4:15,<b>do ruin:</b> Or “behave badly” (Moore).
Judges 4:16,"<b>crossed:</b> As in the literal meaning of “transgressed,” that is, “trans” (cross) + “gressed” (went over), in the sense of violating laws or norms.
<i>First Judge:</i> Otniel: The first of the military leaders whom God sends as a response to Israel’s cries is, not surprisingly, from the tribe of Yehuda. Though brief, the story displays the necessary skeletal elements of Chap. 2’s outline: idolatry, oppression (by an enemy king with a stereotyped name), the Israelite outcry, a leader who is possessed of God’s “spirit,” a quick victory, and a land that remains tranquil for a defined period. As Amit (1999a) notes, it also contains “the largest concentration of formulaic phrases in the book” (fifteen of them, such as “And the people of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,” “served the Baals and the Astartes,” “Y<small>HWH</small> sold them into the hand of … ,” “Y<small>HWH</small> raised up a deliverer,” and “the land was quiet for <i>x</i> years”). The pattern is deceptively simple; from now on, a good deal of color, variation, and ambiguity will be added.
Devora and Barak; Ya’el and Sisera: In another shift from the norm established in Chap. 2, the text here presents multiple heroes, two of them women (unexpected in a book recounting violent exploits). The character of Devora broadens and deepens the question of leadership, introducing a “judge” who indeed sits and governs the people in a way that most of the male judges do not, and who is even described as a “prophet.”
Coming as it does after the stunning deeds of several warrior-judges, the chapter serves to warn the audience that victory ultimately comes from God alone. It accomplishes this by tying the triumph to circumstances unusual for a war: the Israelite commander depends closely on a woman’s counsel, stressing the idea that “it will not be your glory” (v.9), and the enemy general is slain by a noncombatant, also a woman. Indeed, the use of the typical phrase “I will give the enemy into your hand” (here in vv.7 and 14) is nicely counterbalanced by “hand,” referring twice to Ya’el (vv.9 and 21).
The battle scene itself utilizes stock biblical battle language (“panic” in v.15, “not even one was left” in v.16) and is typically brief, preferring to shift the chapter’s focus to the interaction between the characters before and after the actual fighting.
As in the Ehud story, the narrative uses stealth as a major feature. We do not expect betrayal from a covenant partner, nor murder at the hands of a woman, especially one who acts in so maternal a manner: Ya’el covers Sisera (tucks him in!), gives him milk, and stands guard in the tent. Her utter single-mindedness and fearlessness contrast with Barak’s initial hesitation in v.8.
The result echoes Israel’s deliverance at the Reed Sea (Exod. 15); the prose account there ended with “So Y<small>HWH</small> delivered on that day / Israel from the hand of Egypt … ,” while our story similarly reads, “So God humbled on that day / Yavin king of Canaan, before the Children of Israel.”"
Judges 4:17,"Now it was, when he came [there],
that he gave a thrusting-blast on the <i>shofar,</i> in the highlands of Efrayim,
and the Children of Israel went down with him from the highlands, with him ahead of them."
Judges 4:18,"He said to them:
Come down after me,
for Y<small>HWH</small> has given your enemies, Moav, into your hand!
They went down after him
and took the Jordan crossings from Moav;
they did not let a man cross."
Judges 4:19,"And they struck Moav at that time—
about ten thousand men,
all stout ones, all men of valor;
not a man escaped."
Judges 4:20,"Thus Moav was humbled at that time under the hand of Israel.
And the land was quiet for eighty years."
Judges 4:21,"After him was Shamgar son of Anat:
he struck the Philistines, six hundred men, with an ox-goad;
thus he too delivered Israel."
Judges 5:1,"But the Children of Israel again did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and Ehud was dead."
Judges 5:2,"So Y<small>HWH</small> sold them into the hand of Yavin king of Canaan, who reigned as king in Hatzor;
the commander of his armed-forces was Sisera.
Now he sat [enthroned] at Haroshet of the Nations."
Judges 5:3,"And the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>,
for he had nine hundred iron chariots,
and he had been oppressing the Children of Israel strongly for twenty years."
Judges 5:4,"Now Devora was a prophet woman, wife of Lappidot/Torches;
she was judging Israel at that time."
Judges 5:5,"She was sitting [as judge] under the Palm of Devora, between Rama and Bet-El, in the highlands of Efrayim,
and the Children of Israel would come up to her for judgment."
Judges 5:6,"She sent and called for Barak/Lightning son of Avino’am, from Kedesh in Naftali,
and she said to him:
Has not Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, charged you?

I will go, yes, go with you;
but it will not be your glory on the way that you are going.
Rather, it is into the hand of a woman

And Devora arose and went with Barak to Kedesh."
Judges 5:10,"So Barak called up Zevulun and Naftali to Kedesh,
and behind him came up ten thousand men,
while Devora came up with them."
Judges 5:11,"—Now Hever the Kenite had parted from the Kenites,

Judges 5:12,"And Sisera was told that Barak son of Avino’am had come up to Mount Tavor,"

from Haroshet of the Nations to Wadi Kishon."
Judges 5:14,"Devora said to Barak:
Arise, for this is the day that Y<small>HWH</small> is giving Sisera into your hand!

So Barak came down from Mount Tavor,
with ten thousand men behind him."
Judges 5:15,"And Y<small>HWH</small> panicked Sisera and all the chariotry and all the camp, with the mouth of the sword, before Barak,
and Sisera got down from the chariot and fled on foot."

not even one was left."
Judges 5:17,"Now Sisera had fled on foot, to the tent of Ya’el, the wife of Hever the Kenite,
for there was peace between Yavin king of Hatzor and the house of Hever the Kenite.

The Song of Devora: The victory recounted in Chap. 4, probably based on some kind of historical incident, clearly played a key role in Israel’s later vision of itself. Set as it is after the prose account, the poem in the present chapter is parallel, as previously mentioned, to the events of Exod. 14, which similarly is followed by an archaic-sounding poem.
Cross/Freedman and others have maintained that Chap. 5 is one of ancient Israel’s oldest texts, dating perhaps to the period when the event is to have taken place. It contains a number of constructions characteristic of early Hebrew. Brettler (2001a), however, summarizing several decades of recent scholarship, concludes that the bulk of the chapter’s language is “standard biblical Hebrew” and that we can actually draw no conclusions about a composition date. It has long been known that oral literature—if that is what is at play here, as some scholars who make claims for the poem’s historical authenticity maintain—is not actually preserved unaltered for centuries. But if Judg. 5 is not, then, an accurate rehearsal of historical events, or such events are not fully recoverable, what exactly is it, at least as it now appears in the Bible? Brettler’s proposal in this regard is an intriguing one: that the poem may have been used in ancient Israel to rally troops to battle. While he floats this as only a theory, I would add that there exists a more modern American parallel, familiar to schoolchildren of past generations: “Paul Revere’s Ride” by Longfellow. Many, perhaps most, of those made to memorize its famous lines grew up convinced that this was precisely the way events had unfolded in 1775. But the poet composed his piece in 1861, shortly before the first shots were fired on Fort Sumter, and it was dragged out again two years later, at the height of Lincoln’s attempt to get reluctant northerners to enlist in the Union army. Thus the poem, like its ancient relative, was written, or at least used, in Brettler’s words, to “persuade and convince.” In the case of Judg. 5, then, as so often in biblical texts, the events of the past, however accurate their portrayal, may here serve primarily to illuminate some present situation.
The chapter contains memorable imagery, from the distinctive descriptions of the tribes, Y<small>HWH</small> as warrior, the gathering soldiers, and the involvement of the very cosmos (in the person of the stars) in the battle. Vv.4 and 21 in fact point to a rainstorm as a key element in Israel’s victory. Finally, the theme of voluntarism which is emphasized in the poem, lauding those who participated and castigating those who did not, parallels early heroic poetry in other cultures.
Of particular note is the description of Sisera’s assassination in v.27. On the surface, its rhythms are significant, with the repetitions in v.26 reminiscent of slow-motion death scenes in film. But more than that: as feminist readers of the Bible have pointed out, the verbal imagery is actually sexualized. The traditional “at her feet” can quite reasonably be rendered “between her legs,” and the verb “crouched” (Heb. <i>kara</i>’) is used with sexual meaning in Job 31:10. Thus our narrative brilliantly paints Ya’el as a many-faced figure, much as in fairy tales—nurturing mother, potential or actual lover, and finally, of course, gruesome killer. The images do double duty: the milk is a symbol of motherhood, but is also effective in putting Sisera to sleep; the netting/blanket serves to cover him as one would a child, but also ultimately functions as a covering for a corpse; and the tent peg and mallet, which normally betoken domesticity, are transformed into murder weapons, with unavoidably phallic imagery.
In fact, as many interpreters have noted, there are multiple images of the mother here: Devora, described as a “mother in Israel,” is a classic “good mother” figure, whereas Ya’el melds the nurturing and dangerously erotic images of mothering in the strongest way, as mentioned above. The last of the triad of women, Sisera’s mother, combines the picture of parental concern with a condoning reference to rape by the expected victors (v.30, “a lass [literally, ‘a womb’] … for each warrior chief”). Thus conflicting images, which could be understood as varying sides of the same coin, coalesce to express the ambivalence of the Bible’s male writers. Historically speaking, this is not unusual in male-female relations, but its expression is particularly notable in this story.
Most striking of all in the poem, however, is the inclusion at the end of the episode regarding Sisera’s mother, whom we have not met previously, and whose passivity contrasts with Ya’el’s activism. The wrenching image of women helplessly waiting and watching for their husbands, brothers, or sons to return safely from battle, which can be found in the ballads of many cultures up to our own time, is used here to maximum effect. The poet masterfully contrasts the mother’s natural fears, occasioned by her son’s lateness, with her self-delusion, which is punctuated by literally colorful visions of captive women and scarves. These serve only to set up the fiercely triumphant moment of v.31: “So perish all your enemies, O Y<small>HWH</small>!”"
Judges 6:14,"Ya’el came out to meet Sisera
and said to him:
Do turn aside, my lord, do turn aside to me, do not be afraid!
So he turned aside to her, to the tent,
and she covered him with a blanket."
Judges 6:15,"He said to her:
Now let me drink a little water, for I am thirsty!
She opened a skin of milk, gave him drink, and covered him."
Judges 6:16,"Then he said to her:
Stand at the entrance to the tent,
and let it be: if anyone comes and asks you, and says:
Is there anyone here?
you are to say: Nobody."
Judges 6:17,"Then Ya’el, the wife of Hever, took a tent peg, and put a hammer in her hand,
and came to him silently
and thrust the peg into his temple, so that it went down into the ground
—now he had been sound asleep, for he was weary—
and he died."
Judges 6:18,"Now here, Barak was pursuing Sisera,
and Ya’el came out to meet him and said to him:
Come, I will show you the man whom you are seeking.
He came to her, and here was Sisera fallen dead, with the peg in his temple!"

Gid’on I: The Commission: This first full cycle of stories about a hero in Judges opens by utilizing an important category of religious texts: the “call.” A hero is addressed by God or his messenger and is charged with leading the people out of oppression or danger. Here it is prefaced, like the call of Moshe in Exod. 3, by a description of Israel’s sufferings, this time under the Midyanites (vv.2–6). The variation on the classic Judges pattern of Chap. 2 here appears in vv.8–10, where God responds to the Israelites’ usual outcry with the moral equivalent of “What do you expect, given your idolatrous behavior?” Only then can the deliverer be sent.
The call narrative in Judg. 6 looks forward as well as backward. The image of divine fire consuming a sacrifice, and the realization that what appeared to be a man is actually a messenger from God, are both elements of the Shimshon (Samson) birth story in Chap. 13. And the use of “signs” here and elsewhere in the story introduces that major motif into the book (Amit 1999a) as a whole.
There are other variations from the Chap. 2 paradigm in this chapter. The oppression, in this case wrought by the Midyanites, is much more detailed than before; Israel’s very food supply is threatened, and the size of the enemy hordes is vividly described. Then too, instead of directly launching a war of liberation against the Midyanites, vv.25ff. establish Gid’on as a fighter against idolatry, although they also indicate further weakness of character: he is unwilling to risk the wrath of the locals by tearing down the altar to Baal in the daylight hours. The little story here is an etiology, a narrative that explains an important name (in this case “Yerub-baal” for Gid’on). Whereas in the account of Ehud idolatry was on the periphery (suggested only by the mention of “carved images,” or a name with similar meaning), here it becomes central, and surfaces again in Chap. 8. Judges will not let us forget the core issue of the people’s apostasy.
Vv.33–40 return to Gid’on’s need for proof through “signs,” a doubling that suggests not only the hero’s need for reassurance but also that of the audience."
Judges 7:41,"May she be blessed among women, Ya’el,
wife of Hever the Kenite,
among women in tents may she be blessed!"
Judges 7:42,"Water he asked for, milk she gave,
in a bowl for the valiant, she brought near cream."
Judges 7:43,"Her hand to the peg she stretched out,
her right-hand to the workmen’s pounder.
She pounded Sisera, smashed his head,
she shattered and passed it through his temple."
Judges 7:44,"[?] Between her legs he bent down, he fell, he lay,
between her legs he bent down, he fell,
where he bent down, there he fell, ravaged!"
Judges 7:45,"Through the window she peered,
Sisera’s mother wailed through the lattice:

Judges 7:48,"So perish all your enemies, O Y<small>HWH</small>,

Judges 8:1,"But the Children of Israel did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into the hand of Midyan, for seven years."
Judges 8:2,"And the hand of Midyan was powerful against Israel;
[in fear] of Midyan, the Children of Israel made use for themselves of the dens that were in the highlands,
as well as the caves, as well as the strongholds."
Judges 8:3,"It would be, whenever Israel would sow seed,
that Midyan would go up, along with Amalek and the Children of the East;
they would go up against it,"
Judges 8:4,"they would encamp against them and would lay ruin the yield of the ground, as far as where-you-come to Gaza,
and they would not leave anything sustaining-life in Israel
for sheep, or for ox, or for donkey."
Judges 8:5,"For they and their acquired-livestock would go up, along with their tents,
and they would come like locusts in abundance
—[what was] theirs and their camels’ was innumerable—
and they came into the land to bring it to ruin."
Judges 8:6,"So the Children of Israel became exceedingly impoverished before Midyan,
and the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>."
Judges 8:7,"And it was, when the Children of Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>, on account of Midyan,"
Judges 8:8,"that Y<small>HWH</small> sent a man, a prophet, to the Children of Israel;
he said to them:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
I myself brought you up from Egypt,
and took you out of a house of serfs,"
Judges 8:9,"and rescued you from the hand of Egypt
and from the hand of all your oppressors;
I drove them out from before you
and gave you their land."
Judges 8:10,"And I said to you:
I am Y<small>HWH</small> your God;

Judges 8:11,"Now a messenger of Y<small>HWH</small> came and sat under the oak that is in Ofra, that belonged to Yoash the Avi’ezrite,
while Gid’on/Hewer his son was beating down wheat in the winepress,
to whisk it away from before Midyan."
Judges 8:12,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was seen by him;
he said to him:
Y<small>HWH</small> is with you, O mighty-man of valor!"
Judges 8:13,"Gid’on said to him:
Please, my lord,
if Y<small>HWH</small> is with us,
why has all this found us?
Where are all the wonders which our fathers recounted to us, saying:
Was it not from Egypt that Y<small>HWH</small> brought us up?
Yet now, Y<small>HWH</small> has forsaken us
and has given us into the grasp of Midyan!"
Judges 8:14,"Y<small>HWH</small> faced him and said:
Go forth in this strength of yours
and deliver Israel from the grasp of Midyan!
Have I not sent you?"
Judges 8:15,"He said:
Please, O Lord,
whereby shall I deliver Israel?
Here, my family is the weakest in Menashe,
and I am the youngest in my Father’s House!"
Judges 8:16,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Indeed, I will be with you;
you will strike down Midyan as [if they were] one man!"
Judges 8:17,"He said to him:
Now if I have found favor in your eyes,
make me a sign that it is you speaking to me:"
Judges 8:18,"now do not depart from this-place until I come back to you
and have brought out my gift and placed it before you!
He said:
I will stay until your return."
Judges 8:19,"So Gid’on came out
and made ready a goats’ kid with an <i>efa</i> of unleavened meal:
the meat he put in a basket, while the broth he put in a boiling-pot,

Judges 8:20,"And God’s messenger said to him:
Take the meat and the unleavened bread and place them on this boulder,
and the broth, pour out.
He did so."
Judges 8:21,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger stretched out the tip of the crook that was in his hand
and touched the meat and the unleavened bread;
and fire went up from the rock
and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread,

Judges 8:22,"Gid’on saw that he was Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger,

Judges 8:23,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Peace be to you—do not be afraid; you will not die."
Judges 8:24,"Gid’on built there a sacrificial-altar to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and he called it: Y<small>HWH</small> of Peace.
Until this day, it is still in Ofra of the Avi’ezrites."
Judges 8:25,"It was on that night that Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Take an ox bull that belongs to your father,
a second-born bull, seven years old:
you are to tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father,
and the Ashera-pole that is next to it you are to cut down,"
Judges 8:26,"and you are to build an altar to Y<small>HWH</small> your God
on the top of this stronghold in an arrangement [of stones];
then you are to take the second-born bull
and are to offer it up as an offering-up, with the wood of the Ashera-pole that you cut down."
Judges 8:27,"Gid’on took ten men from his servants
and did as Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken to him.
Now it was, because he was too afraid of his Father’s House and of the men of the town to do it during the day,
that he did it during the night."
Judges 8:28,"The men of the town started-early in the morning,
and here, the altar of Baal had been demolished,
and the Ashera-pole that was next to it had been cut down,
and the second-born bull had been offered up upon the rebuilt altar!"
Judges 8:29,"They said, each one to his fellow:
Who did this thing?
They made inquiry and searched,
and they said:
Gid’on son of Yoash did this thing!"
Judges 8:30,"So the men of the town said to Yoash:
Bring out your son, that he may die,
because he demolished the altar of Baal,
and because he cut down the Ashera-pole that was next to it!

Judges 9:16,"<b>afraid:</b> Another indication of a character weakness in Gid’on.
Gid’on II: The Battle Against Midyan: On the heels of Gid’on’s doubts, God counters, emphasizing that there must be no illusion that the Israelite victory could be due to the prowess of its warriors (see a similar sentiment in 4:9, above, using the same key word, “glory”). While the meaning of the symbolism of the soldiers drinking from the stream is elusive, it is clear that Gid’on will succeed militarily, as Yehoshua did, only through God’s intervention, although in the coming battle there are elements of strategy as well.
The dream of the Midyanite soldiers (vv. 13–14) functions as a further sign that God will supply the victory. It is tempting to see in this scene one of the sources of Shakespeare’s famous prebattle dream sequences. A nice touch is supplied by the fact that it is not the hero who has the dream here, but an enemy soldier, who recounts it secondhand.
We do not get to the battle itself until v.17. The victory is quite unorthodox—upside down, as the dream has it: instead of the Israelites doing the slaughtering, it is the confused Midyanites who put each other to the sword. Only the fierce and symbolically named enemy commanders are cited as direct victims of the Israelites, although obviously many of their soldiers would have died in the Israelites’ pursuit."
Judges 9:17,"But Yoash said to all who were standing [in attendance] around him:
Will you yourselves strive for Baal?
Or will you yourselves deliver him?
Whoever strives for him will be put to death by daybreak!
If he is a god, let him strive for himself
when someone demolishes his altar!"
Judges 9:18,"So they called him from that day on: Yerub-baal/Let-Baal-Strive, saying:
Let Baal strive with him,
because he demolished his altar!"
Judges 9:19,"Now all Midyan and Amalek and the Children of the East gathered together;
they crossed over and camped in the Valley of Yizre’el."
Judges 9:20,"But the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> clothed Gid’on;
he gave a blast on the <i>shofar</i> and the Avi’ezrite-clan was summoned after him."
Judges 9:21,"He sent messengers to all of Menashe,
and they rallied to the summons, they too, after him,
and he sent messengers to Asher, to Zevulun, and to Naftali,
and they went up to meet them."
Judges 9:22,"Gid’on said to God:
If you wish to deliver Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,"
Judges 9:23,"here: I am setting a clipping of wool on the threshing-floor;
if dew is on the clipping alone, but on all the ground [it is] dry,
then I will know
that you will deliver Israel by my hand, as you have spoken."
Judges 9:24,"And it was so.
He started-early on the morrow;
he wrung out the clipping
and drained the dew from the clipping—
a bowl full of water."
Judges 9:25,"Then Gid’on said to God:
Do not let your anger flare up against me,
but let me speak just one [more] time:
pray let me make a test only one [more] time with the clipping;
pray let there be dryness on the clipping alone,
but on all the ground let there be dew."
Judges 9:26,"And God did so on that night:
here was dryness on the clipping alone,
but on all the ground there was dew."
Judges 10:1,"Now Yerub-baal—that is Gid’on—and all the fighting-people who were with him started-early;
they camped by En Harod/Spring of Trembling,
while the camp of Midyan was north of it,
at Giv’at Ha-Moreh/Hill of the Sage, in the valley."
Judges 10:2,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
Too many are the fighting-people who are with you
for me to give Midyan into their hand.
—lest Israel honor itself over me, saying:
<i>My</i> [own] hand delivered me!"
Judges 10:3,"So-now,
pray call out in the hearing of the people, saying:
Who is fearful and trembling?
Let him turn back and depart from Mount Gil’ad!
So there turned back from the people twenty-two thousand, while ten thousand remained."
Judges 10:4,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
Still the people are too many!
Lead them down to the water,
that I may refine them for you there:
it will be, [the one] about whom I say to you: This one shall go with you,
he shall go with you,
and [the one] about whom I say to you: This one shall not go beside you,
he shall not go."
Judges 10:5,"So he led the people down to the water,
and Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
Whosoever licks with his tongue from the water, as a dog licks,
set him aside,
but whosoever crouches on his knees to drink …"
Judges 10:6,"Now the number of those who licked, from their hand to their mouth,
was three hundred men,
while all the rest of the people crouched on their knees to drink water."
Judges 10:7,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Gid’on:
By the three hundred men, those who were licking, I will deliver you;
I will give Midyan into your hand,
and then all the people will go, each one back to his place."
Judges 10:8,"So they took the people’s provisions in their hand, along with their <i>shofars,</i>
while all the fighting-men of Israel he sent away, each to his tents,
but of the three hundred men he kept hold.
Now the camp of Midyan was beneath him, in the valley."
Judges 10:9,"And it was on that night
that Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
Arise, go down against the camp,
for I have given it into your hand!"
Judges 10:10,"And if you are afraid to go down [to attack],
go down, you along with Pura your serving-lad, to the camp,"
Judges 10:11,"and hearken to what they are saying;
afterward your hands will be strengthened, so that you may go down against the camp.
So he went down, he and Pura his serving-lad, to the edge of the armed men who were in the camp."
Judges 10:12,"Now Midyan and Amalek and all the Children of the East were sprawled out in the valley, like locusts in abundance,
and their camels had no number,
like the sand that is on the shore of the sea in abundance."
Judges 10:13,"And Gid’on came, and here, a man was recounting a dream to his fellow;
he said:
Here, I have dreamt a dream,
and here, a loaf of barley bread was turning over in the camp of Midyan.
It came as far as the tent and struck it, and it fell;
it overturned it, upward,
and the tent fell down!"
Judges 10:14,"His fellow spoke up and said:
This is none other than the sword of Gid’on son of Yoash, the man of Israel!
God has given Midyan into his hand, yes, the entire camp!"
Judges 10:15,"It was, when Gid’on heard the recounting of the dream and its interpretation,
that he bowed low;
then he returned to the camp of Israel
and said:
Arise, for Y<small>HWH</small> has given into our hand the camp of Midyan!"
Judges 10:16,"He split up the three hundred men into three companies,
and he placed <i>shofars</i> in everyone’s hand along with empty jugs, and torches inside the jugs,"
Judges 10:17,"and said to them:
Look at me and do thus:
when I come to the outskirts of the camp,
let it be: as I do, so you are to do:"
Judges 10:18,"I will sound a blast on the <i>shofar,</i> I and all who are with me,
and then you are to sound a blast on the <i>shofars,</i> you as well, all around the entire camp,
and you are to say:
For Y<small>HWH</small> and for Gid’on!"
Judges 10:19,"So Gid’on came, along with the hundred men who were with him, to the outskirts of the camp,
at the beginning of the middle watch
—they had just installed, installed the watchmen—
and they sounded blasts on the <i>shofars,</i> with the jugs that were in their hand [ready to be] shattered."
Judges 10:20,"And the three companies sounded blasts on the <i>shofars,</i> and broke the jugs;
they gripped the torches in their left hands,
and in their right hands, the <i>shofars,</i> to sound blasts,
and called out:
A sword for Y<small>HWH</small> and for Gid’on!"
Judges 10:21,"Then they stood still, each one in his position all around the camp,
and the entire camp was on the run;
they shouted and they fled."
Judges 10:22,"The three hundred <i>shofars were</i> sounded,
and Y<small>HWH</small> put each one’s sword against his fellow, that is, against the entire camp,

Judges 10:24,"<b>Yerub-baal/Let-Baal-Strive:</b> Or “Let-Baal-Sue.” Trad. English is “Jerubbaal.” In actuality the name probably means “May Baal Plead [for Me]”; the story, however, understands it otherwise, in a classic case of folk etymology. Normally, later scribes polemically substituted <i>bosket,</i> “shame,” for the Baal part of such names (see also “Ish-Boshet” for “Ish-Baal” in II Sam. 2:8,10). Here, though, they did not, because of the centrality of the name Baal in this episode (Burney)."
Judges 10:25,"<b>Children of the East:</b> Or “easterners,” denoting other nomadic groups (Rainey/Notley) <b>Yizre’el:</b> Pronounced <i>yiz-reh-AYL;</i> trad. English “Jezreel,” the large, fertile valley in the northern part of Israel."
Judges 10:26,"<b>the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small> clothed Gid’on:</b> An unusual description which demonstrates how physical the concept of “spirit” is in the Bible.

Judges 11:3,"<b>Who is fearful and trembling?:</b> The concern is that the fearful soldier will demoralize his comrades; see Deut. 20:8. <b>depart:</b> Heb. <i>tz-p-r,</i> a verb with uncertain meaning. Some emend to <i>’-v-r,</i> “cross over,” among others. On the other hand, it sounds like the word for “bird/sparrow,” and so possibly suggests “fly away like a sparrow,” or even “Let him turn back twittering.” <b>Gil’ad:</b> Possibly with the connotation of “fright” (Burney traces it to Babylonian <i>gadalu,</i> “to be afraid”), given that no “Mount Gil’ad” is attested in the Bible."
Judges 11:4,"<b>refine:</b> The Heb. <i>tz-r-f</i> is a metallurgical term for “smelt, test the mettle.” It may also be a play on the <i>tz-p-r</i> of v.3, since <i>p</i> and <i>f</i> are the same root letter in Hebrew (Boling 1975)."
Judges 11:5,"<b>licks … crouches:</b> In Burney’s view, lapping the water on the stomach means that they are vulnerable to attack, and hence God is clearly the only one who can deliver them. The traditional explanation is that the alternative posture, on the knees, implies idolatry."

Gid’on III: Aftermath and Climax: The battle against the Midyanites is not yet over: Gid’on must pursue two of their kings across the Jordan. Before this, however, there is a brief moment of “strife” (recalling the meaning of the name Yerub-baal) with the men of Efrayim—the kind of intertribal problems that will plague the Israelites numerous times in Judges. Gid’on’s treatment of both his fellow Israelites and the enemy is harsh: he ends up threshing and killing the men of Sukkot, and he slays the enemy kings with his own hands.
The chapter caps a turning point in the book, as Schneider comments. Gid’on is the first man to whom the crown is offered, but his rejection of it, while noblesounding and providing a catchphrase for the entire span of the Early Prophets, is followed immediately by his constructing of a semi-idolatrous image which becomes a “snare” for his whole family. And despite Gid’on’s positive death notice in v.28, the moment he dies, the Israelites go back to “whoring after the Baals.” So the mere suggestion of kingship leads to trouble, paralleling Moshe’s experience: even when God is acknowledged as the true king, the people still feel compelled to search for a concrete symbol to worship (Amit 1999a). In addition, the classic Judges pattern has been broken, for the people no longer “cry out” to God for deliverance, and the new, chosen leader is flawed (Schneider). A full reckoning will come in the form of a curse acted out in the next generation.
and the entire camp fled as far as Bet-Shitta, toward Tzerera, to the border of Avel- Mehola, near Tabbat."
Judges 11:16,"The men of Israel were mustered from Naftali, from Asher, and from all of Menashe,
and they pursued after Midyan."
Judges 11:17,"Now Gid’on had sent messengers throughout all the highlands of Efrayim, saying:
Go down to meet Midyan [in battle], and take the water from them, as far as Bet-Bara and the Jordan!
So all the men of Efrayim were mustered, and they captured the water, as far as Bet-Bara and the Jordan."
Judges 11:18,"And they captured the two commanders of Midyan, Orev/Raven and Ze’ev/Wolf;
they killed Orev at Raven’s Rock, while Ze’ev they killed at Wolf’s Vat
—for they had pursued as far as Midyan—
and the heads of Orev and Ze’ev they brought to Gid’on, from across the Jordan."
Judges 12:1,"Then the men of Efrayim said to him:
What is this thing you have done to us, not calling for us
when you went to do battle against Midyan?
And they strove with him strongly."
Judges 12:2,"He said to them:
What now have I done against you?
Are not the gleanings of Efrayim better than the vintage of Avi’ezer?"
Judges 12:3,"Into your hand God has given the commanders of Midyan, Orev and Ze’ev;
what have I been able to do compared to you?
And their spirit [of anger] subsided from upon him, when he spoke these words."
Judges 12:4,"Gid’on came to the Jordan,
crossing over, he and the three hundred men who were with him,
weary and in pursuit."
Judges 12:5,"He said to the men of Sukkot:
Now give some round-loaves of bread to the fighting-people who are behind me,
for they are weary,
while I will pursue after Zevah and Tzalmunna, the kings of Midyan."
Judges 12:6,"The commanders of Sukkot said:
Is the grasp of Zevah and Tzalmunna now in your hand,
that we should give your forces bread?"
Judges 12:7,"Gid’on said:
Therefore,
when God gives Zevah and Tzalmunna into my hand,
I will tread over your flesh with wilderness thorns and with nettles!"
Judges 12:8,"He went up from there to Penuel, and spoke to them like this,
and the men of Penuel answered him
as the men of Sukkot had answered."
Judges 12:9,"So he said also to the men of Penuel, saying:
Upon my return in peace,
I will demolish this tower!"
Judges 12:10,"Now Zevah and Tzalmunna were in Karkor,
and their camps were with them, about fifteen thousand,
all who were left from the entire camp of the Children of the East,
for those fallen were a hundred and twenty thousand men drawing the sword."
Judges 12:11,"And Gid’on went up by the Road of the Tent Dwellers, east of Novah and Yogbeha,
and he struck the camp, while the camp was feeling-secure."
Judges 12:12,"Zevah and Tzalmunna fled, but he pursued after them,
and he captured the two kings of Midyan, Zevah and Tzalmunna,
and made the entire camp tremble."
Judges 12:13,"Gid’on son of Yoash returned from the battle, from Heres Pass,"
Judges 12:14,"and he captured a lad from the men of Sukkot, and questioned him,
and he wrote out for him [the names of] the commanders of Sukkot and its elders,
seventy-seven men."
Judges 12:15,"Then he came to the men of Sukkot
and said:
Here are Zevah and Tzalmunna, with whom you mocked me, saying:
Is the grasp of Zevah and Tzalmunna now in your hand,
that we should give your weary men bread?"
Judges 12:16,"So he took the elders of the town, and the wilderness thorns and the nettles,
and trod over the men of Sukkot with them,"
Judges 12:17,"while the tower of Penuel he demolished, and killed the men of the town."
Judges 12:18,"Then he said to Zevah and Tzalmunna:
What about the men whom you killed at Tavor?
They said:
Like you were they,
every one like the appearance of the king’s sons."
Judges 12:19,"He said:
They were my brothers, the sons of my mother!
By the life of Y<small>HWH</small>,
if [only] you had let them live,
I would not have to kill you!"
Judges 12:20,"And he said to Yeter his firstborn:
Rise up, kill them!
But the lad would not draw his sword,
for he was afraid,
for he was still a lad."
Judges 12:21,"Then Zevah and Tzalmunna said:
Rise up, you yourself, and attack us,
for as the man is, [so] is his might!
So Gid’on arose and killed Zevah and Tzalmunna,
and he took the crescent-ornaments that were on their camels’ necks."
Judges 12:22,"Now the men of Israel said to Gid’on:
Rule over us—so you, so your son, so your son’s son,
for you have delivered us from the hand of Midyan!"
Judges 12:23,"Gid’on said to them:
<i>I</i> will not rule over you,
my son will not rule over you—
Y<small>HWH</small> will rule over you!"
Judges 12:24,"Then Gid’on said to them:
I have a request to request of you:
Give me, each one, a ring from his spoils!
—for they had gold rings, for they were Yishmaelites."
Judges 12:25,"They said:
We will give, yes, give [them] over.
So they spread out a cloth
and threw there, each one, a ring from his spoils."
Judges 12:26,"Now the weight of the gold rings that he requested
was a thousand and seven hundred [weights of] gold,
aside from the crescents and the pearl-drops and the purple garments that were on the kings of Midyan,
and aside from the collars that were around their camels’ necks."
Judges 12:27,"And Gid’on made it into an <i>efod;</i>
he set it up in his town, in Ofra,
and all Israel went whoring after it there.
It became a snare <i>for Gid’on</i> and for his house."
Judges 12:28,"And Midyan was humbled before the Children of Israel,
so that they could no longer lift up their head.
And the land was quiet for forty years in the days of Gid’on."
Judges 12:29,Yerub-baal son of Yoash went and settled down in his house.
Judges 12:30,"Now Gid’on had seventy sons issuing from his loins,
for he had many wives."
Judges 12:31,"As for his concubine, who was in Shekhem, she too bore him a son;
he appointed his name Avimelekh/Father-is-King."
Judges 12:32,"And Gid’on son of Yoash died at a good ripe age,
and was buried in the burial place of Yoash his father,
in Ofra of the Avi’ezrites.

Judges 13:8,"<b>Karkor:</b> East of the Dead Sea, near the Moabite base of operations (Boling)."
Judges 13:9,"<b>Road of the Tent Dwellers:</b> Or “Nomads,” probably the main north-south track (Burney)."
Judges 13:10,"<b>made … tremble:</b> Heb. <i>heherid.</i> Some emend, to better effect, to “devoted-to-destruction” (<i>heherim</i>) or “put-to-the-sword” (<i>heheriv</i>)."
Judges 13:11,"<b>Heres Pass:</b> Pronounced <i>HEH-ress.</i> The location is unclear, but scholars discount that it is identical with Mount Heres in 1:35 or Timnat-Heres in 2:9. The word itself means “sun.”"
Judges 13:12,<b>he wrote:</b> The lad.
Judges 13:13,<b>trod over:</b> So ancient versions; MT has “caused to know” (<i>va-yadosh</i> changed to <i>va-yoda’</i>).
Judges 13:14,<b>at Tavor:</b> The reference is obscure (Boling 1975).
Judges 13:15,<b>Yeter:</b> Similar to the “Yitro” of Exodus (Moses’s father-in-law). The name means “excellence.”
Judges 13:16,"<b>as the man is … :</b> An adult warrior, as opposed to the “lad” or “squire,” will be able to carry out the sentence of vengeance. <b>Gid’on arose:</b> The “Hewer” now does the killing himself."
Judges 13:17,"<b>ring:</b> Not for the fingers, but for the ear (men) or the nose (women). <b>for they were Yishmaelites:</b> The “they” in this verse refers to the Midyanites, who are here identified with the Ishmaelites of Northern Arabia, a group presumably more well known to the text’s audience (JPS). The Ishmaelites were camel breeders who were heavily involved in the incense trade."
Judges 13:18,"<b>We will give, yes, give:</b> Repeating the verb here is the biblical Hebrew equivalent of saying “We agree.”"
Judges 13:19,<b>pearl-drops:</b> Or “pendants.”
Judges 13:20,"<b>made it into:</b> Or “used it for” (Burney). So the text must be describing some kind of idol itself, given the large amount of material (Burney). <b><i>efod:</i></b> Pronounced <i>ay-FODE,</i> this was an outer garment worn by the High Priest (see Exod. 28), perhaps in the shape of an apron. It was used in consulting God (see I Sam. 23:9–12), since in ancient Near Eastern contexts it seems to describe an adornment of divine statues, and was hence a means of contact with the gods. <b>snare:</b> See note to 2:3, above."
Judges 13:21,<b>Yerub-baal:</b> The change of name probably indicates a change in the source of the text.
Judges 13:22,"<b>appointed his name:</b> Buber (1967) points to the only other occurrences of this odd expression, II Kings 17:34 and Neh. 9:7, to assert that it means “giving a new name” and suggests that Avimelekh renames himself. Ironically, the name can also mean “God (Father) Is King,” so Avimelekh is immediately identified as a usurper of both his own father, who had refused the crown, and God.
Avimelekh the Usurper: The rambling three-chapter account of Gid’on is followed by the long one-chapter cautionary tale of his son Avimelekh. If leadership is indeed a theme central to Judges, as Amit (1999a) contends, then this chapter represents a decisive moment in the book. The people had requested a king in 8:22, only to see their wish rejected in the recognition that YHWH is to be Israel’s sole ruler. This is now reinforced by example, as the villain’s name suggests (see the note to 8:31, above). Despite the chapter’s protestations that its main subject is Avimelekh’s payback for his crime of killing all save one of his brothers, the clear implication is that kingship, at least when it is not sanctioned fully by God, will lead to violence and ruin. In this exploration of power and character, one in which, for a change, idolatry is not the issue, Avimelekh points ahead, as suggested above, to Shakespeare, and the story is appropriately studded with ominous features: the would-be leader is the son of a second-level wife, and he gets his power initially from the gentry of Shekhem, the very city that had been the scene of a notorious rape and murder in earlier times (see Gen. 34), and that would one day witness the coming apart of the united kingdom of Israel (I Kings 12). And, of course, Avimelekh seizes power by the wholesale slaughter of his own brothers.
The story’s moral is doubled, with the first warning coming after the murder. Using a common folklore motif, the survival of the youngest of many brothers (see, for example, the Norse story of Sigmund in the <i>Volsunga Saga</i>), we are told what the inevitable outcome will be through Yotam’s famous parable of the trees (vv.8–15). Israel in its normal state is symbolized by vegetation that supplies the treasured staples of figs, olive oil, and wine. And the governing alternative of concentrating power in the hands of one man is likened to dealing with a troublesome indigenous tree, the <i>atad</i> (see the note to v.15, below), which is powerful enough to destroy even the mighty cedars of Lebanon.
As in <i>Richard III,</i> the decline of the usurper takes a while to unfold, fueled by jealousies and “ill will.” Along the way he proves himself a cruel but effective warrior. The introduction of fire into the last of his victories (v.49) foreshadows the end that Yotam had predicted in v.20. Avimelekh’s fate has elements of what has gone before (Sisera’s death at the hands of a woman), and of what will happen to Israel’s first legitimate king, Sha’ul, who will also kill himself once he has been seriously wounded in a losing battle. As mentioned before, Avimelekh’s end is attributed by the text to his crime of fratricide, but the very next verse (57) notes how the men of Shekhem are punished as well, having chosen a king, and a bad one at that.
8:33 Now it was, when Gid’on died,
that the Children of Israel returned and went whoring after the Baals;
they made Baal Berit a god for themselves."
Judges 13:23,"The Children of Israel did not keep Y<small>HWH</small> their God in mind,
the one rescuing them from the hand of all their enemies round about,"
Judges 13:24,"and they did not act in loyalty with the house of Yerub-baal Gid’on,
in accordance with all the good things that he had done for Israel."
Judges 14:1,"Avimelekh son of Yerub-baal went to Shekhem, to his mother’s brothers
and spoke to them and to the entire clan of his mother’s Father’s House, saying:"
Judges 14:2,"Now speak in the hearing of all the landowners of Shekhem:
What is better for you—
for seventy men to rule over you, all of Yerub-baal’s sons,
or for one man to rule over you?
And keep in mind
that I am your bone and your flesh!"
Judges 14:3,"So his mother’s brothers spoke concerning him, in the hearing of all the landowners of Shekhem,
all these words,
and their heart inclined after Avimelekh,
for they said: He is our brother!"
Judges 14:4,"So they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple-house of Baal Berit,
and with them Avimelekh hired some empty and impetuous men;
they went [following] after him."
Judges 14:5,"He came to his Father’s House, to Ofra,
and killed his brothers, Yerub-baal’s sons,
seventy men on one stone;
but Yotam son of Yerub-baal, the youngest, was left,
for he had hidden himself."
Judges 14:6,"Then gathered all the landowners of Shekhem and all of Bet-Millo
and went and kinged Avimelekh as king,
alongside the oak of the monument that is in Shekhem."
Judges 14:7,"Yotam was told [about it],
so he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim
and lifted up his voice and called out;
he said to them:
Hearken to me, O landowners of Shekhem,
that God may hearken to you!"
Judges 14:8,"The trees went, they went to anoint a king over themselves.
And they said to the olive:
Reign as king over us!"
Judges 14:9,"The olive said to them:
Should I be made to leave my luxuriant-oil
through which gods and men honor themselves,
that I should go and hold sway over the trees?"
Judges 14:10,"So the trees said to the fig:
<i>You</i> go, reign as king over us!"
Judges 14:11,"The fig said to them:
Should I be made to leave my sweetness and my good produce,
that I should go and hold sway over the trees?"
Judges 14:12,"So the trees said to the grapevine:
<i>You</i> go, reign as king over us!"
Judges 14:13,"The grapevine said to them:
Should I be made to leave my new-wine,
which gives joy to gods and men,
that I should go and hold sway over the trees?"
Judges 14:14,"So all the trees said to the <i>atad:</i>
<i>You</i> go, reign as king over us!"
Judges 14:15,"The <i>atad</i> said to the trees:
If [it is] in faithfulness you are anointing me as king over you,
come, take refuge in my shade;
but if not—
then let fire come forth from the <i>atad</i>
and devour the cedars of the Levanon!"
Judges 14:16,"So-now, if you acted in truth and integrity
when you made Avimelekh king,
and if you acted in good-faith with Yerub-baal and with his house,
and if you acted in accordance with the dealings of his hands"
Judges 14:17,"—[seeing] that my father did battle for you
and threw aside his own life and rescued you from the hand of Midyan,"
Judges 14:18,"yet you, you have risen up against my Father’s House today
and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone,
and have made Avimelekh, son of his maid, king over the landowners of Shekhem, because he is your brother—"
Judges 14:19,"so if you have acted in truth and integrity with Yerub-baal and his house this day,
may you rejoice in Avimelekh, and may he rejoice in you!"
Judges 14:20,"But if not,
may fire come forth from Avimelekh
and devour the landowners of Shekhem and Bet-Millo,
and may fire come forth from the landowners of Shekhem and Bet-Millo
and devour Avimelekh!

Judges 14:21,"Then Yotam fled:
he ran away and went to Be’er and settled there,
away from the face of Avimelekh his brother."
Judges 14:22,Avimelekh governed Israel for three years.
Judges 14:23,"Then God sent a spirit of evil between Avimelekh and the landowners of Shekhem,
and the landowners of Shekhem broke faith with Avimelekh,"
Judges 14:24,"so that the wrong [done] the seventy sons of Yerub-baal, and their bloodguilt, might come
to be placed on Avimelekh their brother, who had killed them,
and on the landowners of Shekhem,
who had strengthened his hands to kill his brothers."
Judges 14:25,"So the landowners of Shekhem set up ambushers against him on the summits of the mountains,
and they robbed all those who were crossing them on the road.
And it was told to Avimelekh."
Judges 14:26,"Then Gaal/Loathing son of Eved/Slave came, along with his brothers,
and they crossed through Shekhem.
And the landowners of Shekhem put [their] trust in him."
Judges 14:27,"So they went out into the open-field, amassed their vineyards’ [grapes], and trod [them] out,
and they made jubilation;
then they entered the temple-house of their god, and ate and drank,
and made light of Avimelekh."
Judges 14:28,"Gaal son of Eved said:
Who is Avimelekh, and who is Shekhem, that we should serve him?
Is he not the son of Yerub-baal, and Zevul is his adjutant?
The men of Hamor, Shekhem’s father, should serve him,
but why should we serve him ourselves?"
Judges 14:29,"O who would give this people into my hand, that I might remove Avimelekh,
that someone would say to Avimelekh:
Drive off your forces and go away!"
Judges 14:30,"But Zevul the commander of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Eved,
and his anger flared up,"
Judges 14:31,"so he sent messengers to Avimelekh at Aruma, saying:
Here, Gaal son of Eved and his brothers have come to Shekhem,
and here, they are besieging the town against you!"
Judges 14:32,"So-now, arise at night,
you and the fighting-people who are with you,
and wait in ambush in the open-country;"
Judges 14:33,"and it will be in the morning, when the sun rises:
start-early and spread out against the city,
and here, [when] he and the fighting-people who are with him go out to you,
you may do with him whatever your hand finds."
Judges 14:34,"So Avimelekh arose, and all the fighting-people who were with him, at night;
they lay in ambush against Shekhem, in four companies."
Judges 14:35,"Gaal son of Eved went out and stood at the entrance to the town gate,
and Avimelekh and all the people who were with him arose from the ambush."
Judges 14:36,"Gaal saw the people, and he said to Zevul:
Here, fighting-people are coming down from the mountains!
Zevul said to him:
It is the shadow of the mountains that you see as men!"
Judges 14:37,"But Gaal continued further to speak and said:
Here, fighting-people are coming down from the Navel of the Land,
and one company is coming by way of the Soothsayers’ Oak!"
Judges 14:38,"Zevul said to him:
Where, now, is your mouth that was saying:
Who is Avimelekh, that we should serve him?
Isn’t this the people whom you rejected?
Pray go out now and wage battle against them!"
Judges 14:39,"So Gaal went out before the landowners of Shekhem
and waged battle against Avimelekh."
Judges 14:40,"And Avimelekh pursued him, so that he fled from his face,
and many wounded fell, up to the entrance of the gate."
Judges 14:41,"Avimelekh stayed in Aruma,
and Zevul drove out Gaal and his brothers from being settled in Shekhem."
Judges 14:42,"Now it was on the morrow
that the people went out to the open-country and told Avimelekh."
Judges 14:43,"So he took the fighting-people and split them into three companies
and waited in ambush in the open-country.
And he saw that here, the fighting-people were going out of the town,
so he arose against them and struck them."
Judges 14:44,"Now Avimelekh and the companies that were with him spread out
and took their stand at the entrance to the town gate,
while the two [other] companies spread out against all those who were in the open-country, and struck them."
Judges 14:45,"Avimelekh was waging battle against the town all that day,
and he captured the town,
and all the people who were in it, he killed;
then he demolished the town, and sowed it with salt."
Judges 14:46,"And all the landowners of the Tower of Shekhem heard,
so they came to the underground-chamber of the Temple-House of El-Berit."
Judges 14:47,"And it was told to Avimelekh that all the landowners of the Tower of Shekhem had gathered,"
Judges 14:48,"so Avimelekh went up the Mount of Tzalmon,
he and all the fighting-people who were with him,
and Avimelekh took axes in his hand
and cut down tree branch-clumps;
he lifted them up, put them on his shoulder
and said to the fighting-people who were with him:
What you see me do—quickly, do like me!"
Judges 14:49,"So all the fighting-people also cut down, each one, a branch,
and they went [following] after Avimelekh;
they put them on the underground-chamber and kindled the cavern over them with fire,
so that also all the men of the Tower of Shekhem died, about a thousand men and women."
Judges 14:50,"Avimelekh went to Tevetz
and encamped against Tevetz, that he might capture it."
Judges 14:51,"Now there was a strong tower in the midst of the town,
and they fled there, all the men and women, that is, all the landowners of the town;
they shut it upon themselves
and went up on the roof of the tower."
Judges 14:52,"And Avimelekh came up to the tower and waged battle against it,
but when he approached the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire,"
Judges 14:53,"a woman threw a riding millstone onto Avimelekh’s head
and crushed his skull."
Judges 14:54,"Quickly he called out to his serving-lad, his weapons bearer,
and said to him:
Draw your sword and dispatch me,
lest they say of me: A woman killed him!
So his serving-lad pierced him through, and he died."
Judges 14:55,"When the fighting-men of Israel saw that Avimelekh was dead,
they went [home], each one to his place."

Judges 15:3,"<b>on one stone:</b> In Gray’s view (1986), so portrayed to concentrate the blood, with the effect of bringing down a curse of the land on the perpetrator. Some see the act as a ritual killing. <b>Yotam:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-TAHM;</i> trad. English “Jotham.”"
Judges 15:4,"<b>Bet-Millo:</b> Pronounced <i>bayt mee-LO.</i> The name signifies “earth-fill,” possibly describing the supporting structure for a city wall. <b>of the monument:</b> Following the suggestion of LXX; MT has “propped up.” Klein notes the man-made and hence profane nature of this tree, as opposed to, for example, Deborah’s palm tree."

It is thus a fine choice as a symbol of the powerful but destructive Avimelekh. Others understand it as a thorny bush such as the boxwood."
Judges 15:10,"<b>to the trees:</b> A departure from the usage “to them,” which characterized the previous three answers; this heightens the gravity of the <i>atad</i>’s answer. <b>shade:</b> Heb. <i>tzel,</i> as Gray (1986) reminds us, can also mean “protection.”"

Interlude: After the long sequence of stories relating to Gid’on, and before the dramatic ones to come, there seems to be a need for a respite. This is provided by accounts of two “minor” judges, both of which involve wordplays. Ya’ir is from Gil’ad, east of the Jordan; the action will resume there beginning in v.17. From v.6 to v.16, however, there interposes what feels like a reprise of material from Chap. 2: a laying out of the pattern of idolatry, divine anger, foreign oppression, Israelite outcry, and, this time, God’s initial refusal to rescue them. For a change (v.16), the Israelites heed God’s rebuke in vv.11–14 and actually reject their “foreign gods.”"
Judges 15:26,"while all the evil of the men of Shekhem, God returned on their heads,
and the curse of Yotam son of Yerub-baal came upon them."
Judges 16:1,"There arose after Avimelekh, to deliver Israel,
Tola/Scarlet son of Pua son of Dodo, a man of Yissakhar.
Now he was settled in Shamir, in the highlands of Efrayim."
Judges 16:2,"He led Israel as judge for twenty-three years;
then he died, and was buried in Shamir."
Judges 16:3,"There arose after him Ya’ir the Gil’adite;
he led Israel as judge for twenty-two years."
Judges 16:4,"He had thirty sons riding on thirty foals,
and they had thirty towns;
those they call the Tent-Villages of Ya’ir until this day, that are in the land of Gil’ad."
Judges 16:5,"Then Ya’ir died, and was buried in Kamon."
Judges 16:6,"But the Children of Israel continued doing what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>;
they served the Baals and the Astartes
and the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moav,
the gods of the Children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines;
they abandoned Y<small>HWH</small>, and did not serve him."
Judges 16:7,"So Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger flared up against the Children of Israel,
and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Children of Ammon;"
Judges 16:8,"they shattered and battered the Children of Israel from that year on for eighteen years—
all the Children of Israel who were across the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gil’ad.

Judges 17:1,"<b>Pua:</b> A different name (and spelling) than that of the famous midwife (Pu’a) of Exod. :5ff. “Tola son of Pua” means literally “Worm son of Madder” (a plant), both of which yield a reddish dye. <b>Dodo:</b> Pronounced <i>doe-DOE.</i> Meaning “uncle” or “beloved” (like the name “David”), it has an unfortunate ring in English. Hebrew, happily, places the accent on the last syllable."
Judges 17:2,<b>Ya’ir:</b> Trad. English “Jair”; “He Gives Light.”
Judges 17:3,<b>foals … towns:</b> The two words are similar in MT; ancient versions vocalize the second as <i>’irim</i> (towns) rather than <i>’ayarim</i>. JPS nicely renders them “burros … boroughs.” The listing of possessions here undoubtedly stresses wealth; not all of these leaders are simple men of the people.
Judges 17:4,<b>Sidon:</b> Standing not only for the celebrated port city (Sidon in today’s Lebanon) but also for the surrounding region.
Judges 17:5,"<b>shattered … battered:</b> Following JPS, for Heb. <i>vayir’atzu vayrotzetzu.</i> <b>Gil’ad:</b> The large area across the Jordan to the east (north of Ammon), often occupied by the Israelites. The name appears to mean “rugged,” an apt description.
Yiftah: Tracing the precipitous decline that marks the second half of the book, Judges now turns to the first of two problematic figures, Yiftah the Gil’adite. While he is remembered in Western thought and art exclusively for one incident which spans only eleven verses, the ill-fated vow regarding his daughter, the chapter in which this tale is embedded is fully forty verses long, in addition to another seven that round out his story in the next chapter. So it is important to examine the larger setting.
Like the villain Avimelekh, Yiftah is born to a mother of low social status. He obtains leadership not through being commissioned by God (as was, for instance, Gid’on) but by human agency. The Gil’adites elect him as leader, just as Avimelekh had been chosen by the Shekhemites (Schneider). Schneider also points out the connections between Yiftah and King Sha’ul (Saul), who similarly fights the Ammonites and is chosen at Mitzpa (in I Sam. 10; that location appears in v.11 here). It will also be the site of the Israelites’ gathering immediately after the terrible events of Chap. 19.
As part of his leadership role, Yiftah negotiates with the Ammonites, recounting along the way some of Israel’s traditions relating to the Exodus from Egypt. At that time, several peoples to the east of Israel had refused to grant the ex-slaves passage through their territory, leading directly to the Israelites’ God-given victory over them and the possession of their land. Ironically, the Ammonites were not among them; they seem to have been put into this chapter at a later date. In any event, the wordplay, in Yiftah’s speech, on “possess/dispossess” eight times in four verses (21–24) highlights God’s role. The repetitions are perhaps also reflective of the warrior’s forceful, maybe even stubborn, personality, with v.25 witnessing three separate double verb formulations (using “be better … strive … do battle”).
Thus righteously armed, Yiftah commits his fatal error, reflected in the narrative’s wording. First, he vows to sacrifice whatever “goes out” to greet him upon his return from defeating the Ammonites, if God should grant him victory. When that turns out to be his daughter, his only child, he has no choice, according to his culture, but to go through with the pledge that had “gone out” of his mouth (v.36). Second, his harping on the verb “possess” foreshadows the loss of his most treasured possession, his daughter. Finally, we should note that the name Yiftah, while probably originally signifying the divine opening of the womb, may be subtly playing on the idea of opening the mouth.
The motif of sacrificing a child to the gods to ensure success in war is widespread, and the Greeks used it most famously in the Iphigenia story (see Marcus 1986). But whereas that tale is but the beginning of a chain reaction of events stretching over many years—the arrival of the Greeks at Troy, victory after a ten-year war, Agamemnon’s triumphant homecoming, his murder by his wife and her lover, and <i>her</i> murder by their son, who must then wander condemned and tormented for years—the Yiftah story is a single incident about an unmarried woman and an obscure festival. To be sure, it is embedded in the book of Judges as an example of the ongoing decline of Israel and its leadership, but the effect is hardly the same as in the Greek example. Nevertheless, the story’s focus on leadership is crucial. Yiftah is best understood in the biblical context by way of comparison, as so often is the case in this literature, both forward and backward (see Schneider). He certainly recalls Avraham, the faithful one who was willing to sacrifice even his “only one” to God (Gen. 22)—but who, in the end, was emphatically not required to do so. And he anticipates Sha’ul, whose rash vow in I Sam. 14 invokes a nominal death sentence on his son Yonatan, but who likewise is prevented from going through with the threat, in this instance by his indignant troops. Additionally, in the text’s focus on a domestic crisis, Yiftah prepares the ground for Shimshon; despite the military triumphs of both men, they are compromised by private events. By way of summary, one could almost agree with Schneider, who sees in this judge “no qualities, no deeds, no crisis, no God.”
Not surprisingly in a narrative about a vow, language plays a central role in the text. Yiftah is overly wordy with the Ammonites, with the rhetorical flourishes noted above, but it is a single sentence that creates the ultimate disaster in his own family. And it is the family name, the ultimate language marker, which will now die with him, although in long-range perspective, it <i>will</i> survive in later literature and art.
The character of Yiftah’s unnamed daughter deserves some attention. She strangely does not protest her father’s obligation to carry out his vow, either by direct refusal to play the victim or by simply running away. The way in which she retains dignity in the face of a clearly patriarchal text is to request and receive a two-month reprieve to mourn the loss of her sexual maturity in the company of female companions. As Exum (1993) notes, this secures her immortality, if nothing else. But she remains the quintessential anonymous female victim, in a book whose male figures are anything but idealized.
For a more positive treatment of the daughter’s fate as tied to a rite of passage for females in ancient Israel, see Niditch (2008)."
Judges 17:6,"And the Children of Ammon crossed the Jordan to wage battle also against Yehuda, and against Binyamin, and against the House of Efrayim,
and Israel was exceedingly distressed."
Judges 17:7,"So Israel cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
We have sinned against you!
For we have abandoned our God
and have served the Baals!"
Judges 17:8,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to the Children of Israel:
Did not [I deliver you] from Egypt and from the Amorites and from the Children of Ammon and from the Philistines?"
Judges 17:9,"And when the Sidonians and Amalek and Midyan oppressed you,
you cried out to me,
and I delivered you from their hand;"
Judges 17:10,"but you have abandoned me, and served other gods—
therefore I will not continue to deliver you."
Judges 17:11,"Go cry out to the gods whom you have chosen,
let <i>them</i> deliver you at the time of your distress!"
Judges 17:12,"The Children of Israel said to Y<small>HWH</small>:
We have sinned!
Do, you yourself, to us
according with whatever is good in your eyes,
only: just rescue us this day!"
Judges 17:13,"So they removed the foreign gods from their midst
and served Y<small>HWH</small>,
and he became short-tempered with the travails of Israel."
Judges 17:14,"The Children of Ammon mustered [troops] and encamped in Gil’ad,
while the Children of Israel gathered and encamped in Mitzpa."
Judges 17:15,"The fighting-people, the commanders of Gil’ad, said each one to his fellow:
Who is the man that will be first to do battle against the Children of Ammon?
He shall be head of all the settled-folk of Gil’ad!"
Judges 18:1,"Now Yiftah the Gil’adite was a mighty-man of valor,
but he was the son of a whore woman;
Gil’ad begot Yiftah."
Judges 18:2,"And Gil’ad’s wife bore him sons,
but when the wife’s sons grew up,
they drove Yiftah away and said to him:
You shall not get hereditary-property in our Father’s House,
for you are the son of a different woman!"
Judges 18:3,"So Yiftah ran away from the face of his brothers
and settled in the land of Tov/Good.
And there gathered around Yiftah empty men;
they went out [to war] beside him."
Judges 18:4,"Now it was after some years
that the Children of Ammon did battle with Israel,"
Judges 18:5,"and it was, when the Children of Ammon did battle with Israel
that the elders of Gil’ad went to fetch Yiftah from the land of Tov."
Judges 18:6,"They said to Yiftah:
Come now and become chief for us,
that we may wage battle against the Children of Ammon!"
Judges 18:7,"Yiftah said to the elders of Gil’ad:
Is it not you who spurned me
and drove me away from my Father’s House?
So for-what-reason have you come to me now,
when you are in distress?"
Judges 18:8,"The elders of Gil’ad said to Yiftah:
Agreed, [but] now we have returned to you, so that you may go with us
and wage battle against the Children of Ammon,
that you may be headman for us,
for all the settled-folk of Gil’ad!"
Judges 18:9,"Yiftah said to the elders of Gil’ad:
If you reinstate me, yourselves, to wage battle against the Children of Ammon,
so that Y<small>HWH</small> gives them before me,
<i>I</i> will be headman for you."
Judges 18:10,"The elders of Gil’ad said to Yiftah:
May Y<small>HWH</small> be hearer between us:
if we do not do so, in accordance with your word … !"
Judges 18:11,"So Yiftah went with the elders of Gil’ad,
and the people set him as headman and as chief over them;
and Yiftah spoke all his terms in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa."
Judges 18:12,"Then Yiftah sent messengers to the king of the Children of Ammon, saying:
What is there [between] me and you,
that you come to me, to wage battle against my land?"
Judges 18:13,"The king of the Children of Ammon said to Yiftah’s messengers:
Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt,
from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok, as far as the Jordan.
So-now, return it peaceably!"
Judges 18:14,Yiftah once again sent messengers to the king of the Children of Ammon;
Judges 18:15,"he said to him:
Thus says Yiftah:
Israel did not take away the land of Moav or the land of the Children of Ammon;"
Judges 18:16,"rather, when they came up from Egypt,
Israel went through the wilderness, near the Sea of Reeds, and came to Kadesh."
Judges 18:17,"And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying:
Now let me cross through your land.
But the king of Edom did not hearken,
and they sent also to the king of Moav, but he was not willing,
so Israel stayed at Kadesh."
Judges 18:18,"Then they went through the wilderness and circled around the land of Edom and the land of Moav,
and they came to the sun-rise [side] of the land of Moav, and encamped across the Arnon,
but they did not come into the territory of Moav,
for the Arnon is the territory-border of Moav."
Judges 18:19,"And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon;
Israel said to him:
Now let me cross through your land, to my place."
Judges 18:20,"But Sihon did not trust Israel to cross through his territory;
Sihon gathered all his fighting-people and encamped at Yahatz,
and did battle with Israel."
Judges 18:21,"But Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel gave Sihon and all his fighting-people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them,
so Israel came to possess the entire land of the Amorites, the settled-folk of that land."
Judges 18:22,"They took possession of the entire territory of the Amorites,
from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan."
Judges 18:23,"So-now,
Y<small>HWH</small> the God of Israel dispossessed the Amorites before his people Israel—
and you, you would take possession of it?"
Judges 18:24,"Is it not: what Kemosh your god dispossesses, of <i>that</i> you may take possession,
and whatever Y<small>HWH</small> our God dispossesses before us, of <i>that</i> we may take possession?"
Judges 18:25,"So-now, are you better, yes, better than Balak son of Tzippor, king of Moav?
Did he strive, yes, strive with Israel,
or wage battle, yes, battle against them?"
Judges 18:26,"When Israel remained-settled in Heshbon and its daughter-towns, and in Ar’or and its daughter-towns,
and in all the towns that are along the Arnon,
for three hundred years,
for-what-reason did you not rescue [them] during that time?"
Judges 18:27,"As for me, I have not sinned against you,
yet you do me evil by waging battle against me!
May Y<small>HWH</small> the judge render judgment today between Israel and the Children of Ammon!"
Judges 18:28,But the king of the Children of Ammon did not hearken to Yiftah’s words which he had sent to him.
Judges 18:29,"Now there came upon Yiftah the rushing-spirit of Y<small>HWH</small>;
he crossed over to Gil’ad and Menashe,
and he crossed over to Mitzpe of Gil’ad, and from Mitzpe of Gil’ad he crossed over to the Children of Ammon."
Judges 18:30,"And Yiftah vowed a vow to Y<small>HWH</small> and said:
If you will give, yes, give the Children of Ammon into my hand,"
Judges 18:31,"it will be: the one going out who goes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the Children of Ammon
shall be Y<small>HWH</small>’s
and shall be offered up by me as an offering-up!"
Judges 18:32,"So Yiftah crossed over to the Children of Ammon, to wage battle against them,
and Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into his hand;"
Judges 18:33,"he struck them from Aro’er as far as where-you-come to Minnit,
twenty towns, and as far as Avel-Keramim,
an exceedingly great striking down,
and the Children of Ammon were humbled before the Children of Israel."
Judges 18:34,"Yiftah came back to Mitzpa, to his house,
and here, his daughter was going out to meet him, with timbrels and with dancing
—yet she was a lone-child, he had no son or daughter beside her."
Judges 18:35,"It was, when he saw her,
that he tore his garments
and said:
Alas, my daughter! You have cast, yes, cast me down,
you have become my disaster—
for I myself opened my mouth to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and I am not able to turn it back!"
Judges 18:36,"She said to him:
Father, you opened your mouth to Y<small>HWH</small>;
do with me as has gone out of your mouth,
since Y<small>HWH</small> has wrought for you acts of vengeance against your enemies, from the Children of Ammon!"
Judges 18:37,"And she said to her father:
Let this thing be done for me:
let me be for two months,
so that I may go down upon the highlands
and weep for my womanhood, I and my companions."
Judges 18:38,"He said:
Go.
He sent her off for two months,
and she went, she and her companions,
and wept for her womanhood upon the hills."
Judges 18:39,"It was at the end of two months
that she returned to her father,
and he wrought upon her his vow that he had vowed.
Now she had never known a man.
And it became a rule in Israel:

Judges 19:1,"<b>Yiftah:</b> Pronounced <i>yif-TAH;</i> trad. English “Jephthah.” Ironically for the story of a father and a daughter, with no mother mentioned, the name denotes God “opening” the womb."
Judges 19:2,"<b>different:</b> Or “another,” with the flavor, perhaps, of “another kind of.”"
Judges 19:3,"<b>Tov/Good:</b> The region northeast of Gil’ad. The “good” part may refer to the rich soil of the area. <b>empty men:</b> As with David in I Sam. 22:2, Yiftah gathers outcasts to him. Gray (1986) translates as “destitute.”"
Judges 19:4,"<b>chief:</b> Heb. <i>katzin;</i> an Arabic cognate means “one who renders judgment”—hence, parallel to “judge” (<i>shofet</i>), another leadership title."
Judges 19:5,"<b>Agreed:</b> Lit., “this being so.”"
Judges 19:6,"<b>reinstate:</b> Yiftah had been driven out and basically disinherited, given his social status; his acceptance of leadership now hinges on his restoration (Marcus 18)."
Judges 19:7,<b>hearer:</b> The concept is a legal one; God is witness to an oath.
Judges 19:8,"<b>in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Usually indicating a sacred location such as a sanctuary in the Bible. <b>Mitzpa:</b> Klein notes the ironic use here; Yiftah doesn’t “look out” very well, for either the making or carrying out of his oath."
Judges 19:9,"<b>from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok:</b> These two wadis mark the territory from the northern half of the Dead Sea well up to the mountains of Gil’ad (east of the Jordan).

Judges 19:10,<b>when they came up … :</b> See Num. 20–21.
Judges 19:11,<b>Kemosh:</b> Trad. English “Chemosh.” This denotes the Moabite (not Ammonite!) god Kamish; the name appears on the extra-biblical Moabite Stone. <b>Kemosh … Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Reflecting the ancient concept that a god’s control is limited to his territory (Gray 1986).
Judges 19:12,<b>Balak:</b> Pronounced <i>bah-LAHK;</i> he appears more famously in the Bil’am (Balaam) story of Num. 22–24.
Judges 19:13,<b>Heshbon … Ar’or:</b> Moabite cities; versions render the second by the more familiar form of “Aro’er.”
Judges 19:14,"<b>Yiftah’s words:</b> As Mobley (2011) notes, in this chapter and the next, words have the power of life and death."
Judges 19:15,"<b>the one going out who goes out:</b> Though some domestic animals lived inside Israelite houses, Yiftah probably means a person here. <b>offered up by me:</b> Following NJPS, so as not to prejudice the gender; the Hebrew suggests “I shall offer it up.”"
Judges 19:16,<b>Avel-Keramim:</b> “Meadow of the Vineyards.”
Judges 19:17,"<b>a lone-child:</b> And so his name would die with her (Gray 1986). In actuality the name would be carried on by a son, so in this case, it would have to be her son."
Judges 19:18,"<b>cast, yes, cast me down:</b> The Hebrew words (<i>hakhre’a hikhra’tani</i>) are an anagram of <i>’okhri,</i> “my disaster,” recalling the Akhan story in Josh. 7. Consequently the LXX emends the first phrase accordingly: “You have brought disaster …” <b>opened my mouth:</b> Took an oath, made a promise."
Judges 19:19,"<b>go down:</b> or “wander free” (Burney), reading <i>ve-radti</i> for MT <i>ve-yaradti.</i> But see JPS on Isa. 15:3, where <i>y-r-d</i> and weeping occur together. <b>weep … womanhood:</b> The Hebrew is not assonant. <b>womanhood:</b> That is, marriageable state (or “nubility”), naturally congruent with virginity in that society, but not necessarily identical to it (Wenham)."
Judges 19:20,"<b>he wrought upon her:</b> Mobley (2011) notes how the fate of this young woman, even in a book filled with violence, is “literally unspeakable.”
Civil Strife; More Minor Judges: This chapter is an example of how, often, the biblical chapter numbers do not fully correspond to natural divisions in the text (they were, after all, developed millennia later, probably by Bishop Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, d. 1228). It begins with the final episodes of the Yiftah story—first, with a minor civil war, which reprises the Efrayimites’ unhappiness of 8:1 and anticipates the strife-filled final chapters of the entire book. Here the Yiftah motif of language returns; this time, it is neither a pun, a doubled verb, nor a hasty vow that grabs our attention, but rather the pronunciation of a single word (shibbolet) which marks the dividing line between life and death.
The summary of Yiftah’s career includes notice of his anomalous six-year term as judge. There now follow three new figures in quick succession, combining regional or tribal interests and descriptions of wealth, as measured in children and animals."
Judges 19:21,"from year-day to year-day, the daughters of Israel go to
retell [the tale] of the daughter of Yiftah the Gil’adite,
four days a year."
Judges 20:1,"The men of Efrayim were mustered;
they crossed over to Tzafon
and said to Yiftah:
For-what-reason did you cross over to wage battle against the Children of Ammon,
but <i>us</i> you did not call to go with you?
Your house we will burn down over you with fire!"
Judges 20:2,"Yiftah said to them:
I was a man in strife, I and my people and the Children of Ammon, exceedingly much;
I summoned you, but you did not deliver me from their hand,"
Judges 20:3,"so when I saw that you were not acting-as-deliverer,
I put my life in my palm and crossed over to the Children of Ammon,
and Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into my hand.
So why have you come up against me this day, to wage battle against me?"
Judges 20:4,"And Yiftah gathered all the fighting-men of Gil’ad and did battle with Efrayim,
and the men of Gil’ad struck Efrayim,
for they had said:
Fugitives of Efrayim are you, [men of] Gil’ad;
[being] among Efrayim is [like being] among Menashe!"
Judges 20:5,"And Gil’ad took the Jordan crossings of Efrayim.
Now it would be, when [one of] the fugitives of Efrayim would say:
Let me cross!
that the men of Gil’ad would say to him:
Are you an Efratite?
He would say:
No."
Judges 20:6,"Then they would say to him:
Now say <i>“shibbolet,”</i>
and he would say <i>“sibbolet”</i>
—he did not understand how to speak correctly—
so they would grab him and slaughter him, at the Jordan crossings;
there fell from Efrayim at that time forty-two thousand."
Judges 20:7,"And Yiftah led Israel as judge for six years;
then Yiftah the Gil’adite died
and was buried in his town, [in] Gil’ad."
Judges 20:8,"After him, Ivtzan from Bet-Lehem led Israel as judge;"
Judges 20:9,"—he had thirty sons,
and thirty daughters he sent away outside,
while thirty daughters he brought for his sons from the outside—
and he led Israel as judge for seven years."
Judges 20:10,"Then Ivtzan died
and was buried in Bet-Lehem."

Judges 20:13,"After him, Avdon son of Hillel the Pir’atonite led Israel as judge"
Judges 20:14,"—he had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons, riding on seventy ass-colts—
and led Israel as judge for eight years."
Judges 20:15,"Then Avdon son of Hillel the Pir’atonite died
and was buried at Pir’aton in the region of Efrayim, in the Amalekite highlands.

Judges 20:16,<b>retell:</b> Others “bewail.” But see note to 5:11. above.

Gray (198) points to the differing Hebrew and Arabic pronunciations of one letter as a parallel (e.g., Heb. <i>shalom</i> and Arabic <i>salaam</i>).

The Birth of Shimshon: The narrative now moves on to a second impulsive character. But the story opens in leisurely and formulaic fashion, utilizing repeating words and phrases and allowing the dramatic and entertaining action to properly build up.
The significance of the Shimshon story, which ends the core narratives about individual judges, is signaled by the appearance and involvement of a divine messenger, whose exit is miraculous and pyrotechnic, and by the repetition of rules regarding both the mother’s pregnancy and the hero’s future life. The announcement of conception to a previously barren woman is something we have encountered many times before in Genesis, where it always signifies the birth of a hero, but it receives its most elaborate treatment here. In its representation of Nazirite regulations—detailed in Num. 6 as a person taking on a special vow not to drink wine or beer, cut his/her hair, or come into contact with a corpse or carcass—there are several twists: the <i>mother</i> is given parallel rules, and, more specifically, the “Consecrated One’s” status will be lifelong and not confined to a limited time frame. It should be noted that the next book will open with a similarly lifelong devotee, Shemuel (Samuel).
We have encountered an angel before in Judges, in the Gid’on story of Chap. 6, but the recipient of revelation here is a woman (with an absent husband), reinforcing the importance of women throughout the book and especially in the Shimshon cycle. The parallel annunciation account in the New Testament became a key scene in medieval Western art, and for this and other reasons, Shimshon was often regarded in early and later Christianity as a prefiguring (“type”) of Jesus.
From the outset, the story (and the cycle) involves secrets and mysteries. The woman is befuddled by the appearance of a stranger who looks like a messenger of God (v.6); her husband will likewise have no clue as to the angel’s identity until the angel does something out of the ordinary (v.19). The revelation of the messenger’s secret, far from having a salutary effect, strikes fear into Manoah’s heart, which can only be calmed down after his wife reassures him. The chapter ends with the note of the birth, naming, and one-phrase childhood and adolescence of Shimshon, but what Y<small>HWH</small>’s spirit “stirring him up” will mean remains to be fully discovered. For Gid’on and Yiftah it had signified the charismatic ability to lead the troops, but that will not be the pattern here.
The presence of secrets reminds us that the narrative is studded with folklore motifs. Besides the birth of a hero to a previously barren mother, the text begins with the fairy-tale-like opening, “There was a man” (see also, as other examples, I Sam. 1:1 and 9:1). And the angel disappears in the flame of the altar, another classic “sign” of God’s acts of deliverance (Amit 1999a). Additionally, the verbal repetitions betoken the world of folklore, as well as the Bible’s use of repetition, with “see” as a verb seven times, and “guard,” three.
Almost lost in the details of the chapter is the notice that Shimshon “shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines” (v.5). He thus anticipates the monarchy or, more specifically, King David, who will finish the job. As is typical in Judges, Shimshon’s victory will be only a temporary one.
In true biblical fashion, there is no childhood in the story. Shimshon does not have to display prodigious feats of strength, as the infant Herakles does in strangling snakes sent by a jealous Hera. The text need only note that God blesses him (v.24), and that Shimshon feels the beginnings of his strength on home ground. The rest will follow soon enough."
Judges 22:1,"The Children of Israel again did what was evil in the eyes of Y<small>HWH</small>,
so Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years."
Judges 22:2,"There was a man from Tzor’a, from a Danite clan;
his name was Manoah.
Now his wife was barren, she had not given birth."
Judges 22:3,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was seen by the woman;
he said to her:
Now here,
you are barren, you have not given birth,
but you shall conceive, you shall give birth to a son."
Judges 22:4,"So-now, pray guard yourself:
do not drink wine or beer,
do not eat anything <i>tamei,</i>"
Judges 22:5,"for here, you are about to conceive, you shall give birth to a son.
A razor must not go up on his head,
for One Consecrated to God shall the lad be from the womb on;
he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines!"
Judges 22:6,"The woman came and said to her husband, saying:
A man of God came to me,
the sight of him like the sight of a messenger of God,
exceedingly awe-inspiring.
I did not ask him where he was from,
and his name he did not tell me,"
Judges 22:7,"but he said to me:
Here, you are about to conceive, you shall give birth to a son;
so-now,
do not drink wine or beer,
do not eat anything <i>tamei,</i>
for One Consecrated to God shall the lad be
from the womb until the day of his death!"
Judges 22:8,"Manoah entreated Y<small>HWH</small>, he said:
O my Lord,
as for the man of God whom you sent, pray let him come again to us
and instruct us: What are we to do for the boy who will be born?"
Judges 22:9,"God hearkened to the voice of Manoah,
and God’s messenger came again to the woman
—now she was sitting in the open-field, while her husband Manoah was not with her."
Judges 22:10,"Quickly the woman ran and told it to her husband; she said to him:
Here, he has made himself seen by me, the man who came in the day to me!"
Judges 22:11,"Manoah arose and went after his wife;
he came to the man and said to him:
Are you the man who spoke to the woman?
He said:
I am."
Judges 22:12,"Manoah said:
So-now, should your words come to pass,
what will be the rule for the boy and what-we-do for him?"
Judges 22:13,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to Manoah:
From all that I said to the woman she is to guard herself,"
Judges 22:14,"from all that goes out from the vine of wine she is not to eat,
wine and beer she must not drink,
all [things] <i>tamei</i> she must not eat;
all that I have commanded her, she is to guard.

13.1 <b>Philistines:</b> This group, whose area of settlement lay largely on the coast of Israel, appears to have been one of the “Sea Peoples” who invaded the Near East from somewhere in the Mediterranean in the twelfth century <small>B.C.E.</small> Unsuccessful in gaining a foothold in Egypt, the Philistines became Israel’s principal foe in Judges and Samuel—technologically advanced through possession of iron weapons, and militarily powerful. Little is known of their language and religion; their pottery, however, has affinities with that of the Aegean. They quickly adopted Canaanite culture and, despite being decisively defeated by King David, survived for centuries. Ironically, their name, vocalized as “Palestine,” became that of the country after biblical kings were long gone, and is today used as the name of a proposed Arab state in the West Bank/Gaza."
Judges 22:15,"<b>Tzor’a:</b> A town fifteen miles west of Jerusalem, near Bet-Shemesh. The story opens not far from the border with Philistia. <b>a Danite clan:</b> Had the body of the tribe already migrated far to the north, as in Chap. 18? <b>Manoah:</b> Pronounced <i>mah-NO-ah;</i> the name connotes a “secure resting place.” <b>barren:</b> A sure sign in the Bible that a significant figure is about to be born."
Judges 22:16,"<b><i>tamei:</i></b> Ritually polluted, and so forbidden (see, for instance, the list in Lev. 11)."
Judges 22:17,"<b>One Consecrated:</b> Others, transcribing the Hebrew, render as “Nazirite.” See Commentary."
Judges 22:18,"<b>until the day of his death:</b> The woman has changed the messenger’s words of v.5, foreshadowing the events of Chap. 16. The omission of the usual Nazirite prohibition against haircutting (also in v.14) is surprising, given Manoah’s request for detailed information. Perhaps this is another instance of the theme of secrecy in the story."
Judges 22:19,"<b>rule:</b> In the sense of “a set of rules,” also referring to one’s regular or customary practice.
Shimshon’s Marriage: Before the hero is able to do any “delivering,” his first contact with the Philistines characteristically involves a woman. Strikingly, the text emphasizes seeing (vv.1–2, and “eyes” in v.3) instead of using the term “love,” which will take its time to appear.
Shimshon’s first superhuman act is the slaying of a lion, parallel to Herakles’s killing the Nemean lion. Normally an occasion for wonderment, in the context of the cycle it signals the first breaking of Nazirite restrictions, contact with the dead. It also introduces the hiding of secrets in this particular chapter, which is accomplished by having the parental escort mysteriously disappear in vv.5–6. This is followed by the account of how Shimshon’s wife betrays the secret of his riddle, against the background of yet another violation of his vows, as the term “drinkfest” in v.10 hints.
Verbal repetitions here include “take,” “my people,” “riddle a riddle,” “not telling,” and the rhythmic fivefold mention of the place name Timna. And Shimshon’s act of “breaking off” (<i>r-d-h</i>) honey supplies the chapter’s seventh occurrence of sounds suggested by the family’s movement of “going down” (<i>y-r-d</i>) to Philistine territory.
The whole chapter utilizes folk motifs: Shimshon’s slaying of the lion (a favorite subject in Western art), the honey in the carcass, the riddle, the use of numbers three and four, the pressure from the wife, and the substitution of armor for festive garments. It sets a precedent for the climactic Delila story of Chap. 16, which describes the use of feminine wiles in almost identical terms. Once the first woman has talked Shimshon into revealing his first secret, we know that the last woman will have no trouble prying the crucial one out of him in the end.
The inclusion of a riddle in this chapter is another one of Klein’s examples of irony in Judges; often in folklore, solving a riddle leads to winning, not losing, the bride."
Judges 22:20,"Manoah said to Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger:
Now let us detain you,
that we may make ready a goats’ kid for you."
Judges 22:21,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to Manoah:
If you detain me, I will not eat of your food,
but if you wish to make ready an offering-up to Y<small>HWH</small>, you should offer it up
—for Manoah did not know that he was Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger."
Judges 22:22,"Manoah said to Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger:
What is your name,
so that when your words come to pass, we may honor you?"
Judges 22:23,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger said to him:
Now why do you ask about my name?
For it is wondrous!"
Judges 22:24,"Manoah took the goats’ kid and the gift-offering
and offered them up on the rock to Y<small>HWH</small>.
He did wondrously, while Manoah and his wife saw it:"
Judges 22:25,"it was,
as the flame was going upward from the altar to the heavens,
that Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger went up in the flame of the altar.
When Manoah and his wife saw it,
they flung themselves upon their faces to the ground."
Judges 22:26,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger was not seen again by Manoah or by his wife,
so Manoah knew that he was Y<small>HWH</small>’s messenger."
Judges 22:27,"Manoah said to his wife:
We are going to die, yes, die,
for it is a god that we have seen!"
Judges 22:28,"But his wife said to him:
Had Y<small>HWH</small> desired to have us die
he would not have taken an offering-up and a grain-gift from our hand,
he would not have let us see all these,
and at that moment, he would not have let us hear such things."
Judges 22:29,"The woman gave birth to a son;
she called his name Shimshon.
The boy grew up, and Y<small>HWH</small> blessed him."
Judges 22:30,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s rushing-spirit began to stir him up in Mahaneh-Dan,
between Tzor’a and Eshtaol."
Judges 23:1,"Shimshon went down to Timna,
and he saw a woman in Timna from the daughters of the Philistines."
Judges 23:2,"He came up and told it to his father and to his mother;
he said:
A woman have I seen in Timna from the daughters of the Philistines.
So-now, take her for me as a wife!"
Judges 23:3,"His father and his mother said to him:
Is there not among your brothers’ daughters or among all my people a woman,
that you must go to take a woman from the Philistines, the Foreskinned Ones?
Shimshon said to his father:
Take <i>her</i> for me, for she is right in my eyes!"
Judges 23:4,"Now his father and his mother did not know that it was from Y<small>HWH</small>,
for he was seeking a pretext from the Philistines
—now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel."
Judges 23:5,"Shimshon went down along with his father and his mother to Timna;
they had come as far as the vineyards of Timna
when here, a full-maned roaring lion, [coming] to meet him!"
Judges 23:6,"Y<small>HWH</small>’s spirit advanced upon him
and he tore it apart as one tears apart a kid,
without a thing in his hand.
But he did not tell his father and his mother what he had done."
Judges 23:7,"Then he went down and spoke to the woman—
she was right in Shimshon’s eyes."
Judges 23:8,"He returned after a year to take her;
he turned aside to see the fallen lion,
and here: a swarm of bees in the lion’s corpse, and honey!"
Judges 23:9,"He broke it off into his hands,
and went along, going and eating.
Then he went back to his father and to his mother,
and gave some to them, and they ate.
But he did not tell them that it was from the lion’s corpse that he had broken off the honey."
Judges 23:10,"His father went down on account of the woman,
and Shimshon made a drinkfest there, for that is what young men do;"
Judges 23:11,"and it was when they saw him, that they fetched thirty feasting-companions [who] remained with him."
Judges 23:12,"Shimshon said to them:
Now let me riddle you a riddle!
If you can tell, yes, tell me its [answer] during the seven days of the drinkfest
and can find it out,
I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes;"
Judges 23:13,"but if you are not able to tell me,
you will have to give me, yourselves, thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes.

Judges 24:8,"<b>broke it off:</b> “It” here probably refers to a piece of honeycomb. Scraping it off, as some translations have it, would be rather a messy procedure. The use of the rare <i>r-d-h</i> here may be for the sake of punning with the theme word <i>y-r-d,</i> “go down” (Boling)."

Judges 24:11,"<b>clothes:</b> Most likely festival garments.
Shimshon with Philistines and Judahites: The troubled wedding feast gives way to revenge on all sides (v.10: “to do to him as he did to us”; v.11: “As they did to me, so I did to them”). Shimshon’s wife is given to another, so he counters with the colorful episode of the fox tails and the fire, in which the Philistine crops are destroyed. This results in another fire, causing the death of Shimshon’s wife and father-in-law, which is followed by Shimshon’s taking revenge by slaughtering more Philistines.
The story in the second half of the chapter (vv.9ff.) witnesses the hero’s first reported contact with other Israelites. It also introduces the symbolically important theme of binding, already implied by the same verb in the Nazirite restrictions. For a third straight chapter, an animal plays a role in the narrative, this time in the form of a donkey’s jawbone. Shimshon’s victims are legion; a fitting illustration of the scene is Gustave Dore’s classic etching, found in many Bibles, which features innumerable tiny figures falling into the gorge. While the text then presents an etiological passage, with two names (Ramat Lehi and En Ha-Korei) receiving folk etymologies, its real significance lies in Shimshon’s calling upon God—something he will not do again until his final moments. The hero, like Eliyyahu (Elijah) in I Kings 17, is nourished by God, but, unlike the prophet, the strong man gives no indication of his true calling. The “great deliverance” for which he pleads is thus only his personal one, and he does not view the slaying of a thousand Philistines as an act undertaken on behalf of an oppressed people. All the more jarring, then, is the editorial note that has been inserted in v.20, characterizing Shimshon as a “judge.”
They said to him:
Riddle your riddle, and we will hear it!"
Judges 24:12,"He said to them:
Out of the eater came food-to-eat,
out of the strong one came something sweet.
They could not tell him [the answer to] the riddle for three days;"
Judges 24:13,"so on the fourth day it was that they said to Shimshon’s wife:
Seduce your husband, that he may tell us [the answer to] the riddle,
lest we burn you and your Father’s House with fire—
is it to dispossess us that you have invited us here?"
Judges 24:14,"Shimshon’s wife wept on him, she said:
You surely hate me, you do not love me;
should you riddle a riddle to the sons of my people,
and not tell [the answer] to me?
He said to her:
Here, I haven’t told it to my father or to my mother—
so should I tell it to you?"
Judges 24:15,"She wept on him for the seven days in which they held the drinkfest,
and then it was, on the seventh day, that he told it to her, for she kept pressing him,
and she told the riddle’s [answer] to the sons of her people."
Judges 24:16,"So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day, before the daystar set:
What is sweeter than honey?
What is stronger than a lion?
He said to them:
If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer,
you wouldn’t have found out my riddle!"
Judges 24:17,"And Y<small>HWH</small>’s spirit advanced upon him;
he went down to Ashkelon
and struck down thirty fighting-men of them,

His anger flared on,
and he went up to his father’s house."
Judges 24:18,"Now Shimshon’s wife was [given] to one of his feasting-companions, who had been his [own] companion."
Judges 25:1,"Now it was [after] a year, in the days of the wheat cutting,
that Shimshon visited his wife with a goats’ kid;
he said: I will come in to my wife, in the inner-room!
But her father did not give him [leave] to come in."
Judges 25:2,"Her father said:
I said [to myself], said:
Indeed, you bear hatred, yes, hatred toward her,
so I gave her to your companion.
Isn’t her sister more good-looking than she?
Let her be yours in her place!"
Judges 25:3,"Shimshon said to them:
This time I will be clear of blame from the Philistines,
if I do evil with them!"
Judges 25:4,"So Shimshon went
and captured three hundred foxes,
and took [some] torches
and faced tail to tail,
and placed each torch between two tails, in the middle,"
Judges 25:5,"and ignited fire in the torches,
and sent them free in the standing-stalks of the Philistines;
he ignited from sheaf-stacks to standing-stalks, to vineyards [and] olive-trees."
Judges 25:6,"The Philistines said:
Who has done this?
They said:
Shimshon, the Timnite’s son-in-law,
for he took away his wife and gave her to his companion!
So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire."
Judges 25:7,"Shimshon said to them:
If you do [things] like this,
surely when I have avenged myself upon you, [only] afterward will I stop!"
Judges 25:8,"And he struck them down, hip over thigh, a great striking down;
then he went down and stayed in the gorge of Etam’s Crag."
Judges 25:9,"The Philistines went up and camped in Yehuda;
they were spread out at Lehi."
Judges 25:10,"And the fighting-men of Yehuda said:

To bind Shimshon have we come up,
to do to him as he did to us!"
Judges 25:11,"Three thousand fighting-men from Yehuda went down to the gorge of Etam’s Crag
and said to Shimshon:

Judges 25:14,"<b>before the daystar set:</b> That is, just before the sun came in, an element common to folktales.

Mikha and the Levite: The final section of Judges begins with a brand- new story (“There was a man …”). A family crime, a son’s theft of a large sum of money from his mother, leads ultimately to another one, idolatry, with implications for all Israel. The text demonstrates not only the defective leadership we have traced over the past chapters, but a systemic religious decline that will be confirmed in subsequent chapters. Mikha gives living proof of the refrain that will resound so often throughout this final section—“each one would do what was right in his eyes”—by making an idol and appointing a Levite as his own personal priest.
In the absence of any kind of effective leadership, the text presents us with three characters of dubious distinction: a thieving son, a parsimonious and idolatrous mother, and a wandering young Levite who is all too happy to serve as a priest in an idol-worshipping household. The text itself, however, applies no adjectives to them; they are known only through their actions (Schneider).
The story’s vocabulary, especially as the Levite is hired, is consistent: “Levite” six times, “sojourn” twice, and “lad” three times. And, lest it seem jarring after so many stories about military leaders, it contains at least several links to the Shimshon cycle: an active mother, the phrase “right in his/their own eyes,” and a sum of money identical to what was promised to Delila by the Philistines."
Judges 27:1,"There was a man from the highlands of Efrayim;
his name was Mikhayehu."
Judges 27:2,"[Once] he said to his mother:
The thousand and a hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you,
and you yourself put an oath-curse [on it], and even said it in my hearing—
here, the silver is with me,
I myself took it!
His mother said:
Blessed is my son of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Judges 27:3,"He has returned the thousand and a hundred pieces of silver to his mother!
And his mother said:
I render the silver holy, yes, holy to Y<small>HWH</small>,
from my hand, for my son,
to make a carved and molten [idol].
So-now, I return it to you."
Judges 27:4,"He returned the silver to his mother,
and his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave it to a smelter;
he made it into a carved and molten [idol],
and it remained in the house of Mikhayehu."
Judges 27:5,"Now the man Mikha had a house of God;
he had made an <i>efod</i> and <i>terafim</i>
and had given-mandate to one of his sons, so that he had become a priest for him.

Judges 28:1,<b>Mikhayehu:</b> Pronounced <i>mee-KHA-y’hu;</i> trad. English “Micaiah.” It means “Who Is Like Y<small>HWH</small>?” (ironic in a story about idolatry) and is sometimes shortened to “Mikha” in the narrative that follows. A more familiar variation of the name is “Mikhael” (Michael).
Judges 28:2,"<b>thousand and a hundred:</b> A sum identical to the reward promised to Delila in the previous chapter, leading some commentators to identify the mother here with that more famous lady. Or it may simply have a connecting function, enabling the editor(s) to juxtapose the two stories (and note too the reappearance in vv.8 and 11 of the place-names cited previously in 13:5 and 16:31). <b>oath-curse:</b> Invoked when human punishment cannot be brought to bear (Gray 1986). In this story it makes Mikhayehu’s nonpayment to his mother an occasion for divine punishment. <b>Blessed is my son:</b> She effectively removes the curse (JPS note)."
Judges 28:3,<b>for my son:</b> Heb. <i>li-vni;</i> LXX reads “alone” (<i>levaddi</i>). <b>a carved and molten</b> [<b>idol</b>]: The figure would be made from molten metal poured into a mold carved in the desired shape. This emphatically violates the Israelites’ covenant with Y<small>HWH</small> (see Exod. 20:2). <b>to you:</b> To God.
Judges 28:4,<b>two hundred pieces:</b> What did she do with the other nine hundred? Is this a hint of misappropriation or of stinginess?
Judges 28:5,"<b>house of God:</b> Some read as “house of gods,” which the Hebrew allows; most translations simply use “shrine.” <b><i>efod:</i></b> See note to 8:27 above. <i>terafim:</i> usually understood as household idols or figurines; see Gen. 31:19ff. <b>given-mandate:</b> Lit. “filled the hand,” installing him as a priest. <b>one of his sons:</b> Since he was not a Levite, this is quite illegal (Amit 2004).
The Danite Migration and Its Consequences: What in several scholars’ estimation is the original end of the book of Judges is a mixture of a small-scale story (continued from the previous chapter) and a larger event rooted in some kind of historical memory, the northward migration of the tribe of Dan. But those elements have been transformed into an ideological text, the main purpose of which seems to be (as Brettler 2001a emphasizes; see above) to condemn the future northern rebellion during the reign of King Rehav’am (Rehoboam) some centuries later. The need to convey such a message is so strong that it does not seem to matter to the editors that the migration, chronologically speaking, should really have appeared much earlier in the book.
The Danites are portrayed here as cruel, thieving, and idolatrous—they destroy a peaceful and “secure” city, echoing the destruction of Shekhem in Gen. 34, they steal Mikha’s personal idols and his priest, and they keep the idols and the priest not just for the moment but permanently (“until the time of the exile of the land,” v.30). Three times, in vv.11, 16, and 17, they are menacingly described as “girded in battle gear.” As the book began with conquest, so this initial transitional section ends as well, along with a ringing condemnation of the north for practices that in II Kings 17 will lead to the permanent end of the kingdom.
This negativity is borne out by vocabulary in the middle of the chapter (vv.14–24) which concentrates on words connected to idolatry: “carved-image,” “gods,” <i>“efod”</i> (see 8:27), “<i>terafim</i>,” and “molten-image.” To top it all off, a scribe has even sneaked into a story about the north the name of the most hated king in southern (Judean) history, by substituting the name “Menashe” (Manasseh; see II Kings 18) for “Moshe” (Moses) in v.30, in what is outwardly an attempt to disassociate the great lawgiver’s family from any connection to later idolatrous events."
Judges 28:6,"In those days, there was no king in Israel;
each one would do what was right in his eyes."
Judges 28:7,"There was a lad from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda, from a clan of Yehuda
—now he was a Levite, and he was sojourning there."
Judges 28:8,"And the man went from the town, from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda to sojourn wherever he could find,
and he came to the highlands of Efrayim, to the house of Mikha, to make his way."
Judges 28:9,"Mikha said to him:
From where have you come?
He said to him:
I am a Levite,
from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda,
and I am going to sojourn wherever I can find."
Judges 28:10,"Mikha said to him:
Come stay with me, and be for me a “father” and a priest,
and I myself will give you ten pieces of silver a year, an outfit of garments, and your living needs.
So the Levite went;"
Judges 28:11,"the Levite agreed to settle with the man,
and the lad became for him like one of his sons."
Judges 28:12,"Mikha gave-mandate to the Levite,
and the lad became a priest for him
and remained in Mikha’s house."
Judges 28:13,"Mikha said:
Now I know
that Y<small>HWH</small> will do good for me,
for a Levite has become a priest for me!"
Judges 29:1,"In those days, there was no king in Israel.
And in those days, the Danite tribe was seeking for itself a hereditary-property to settle in,
for there had not fallen [any land] to it until that day among the tribes of Israel as a hereditary-property."
Judges 29:2,"So the Children of Dan sent from their clan five men from [all] their quarters, valiant men from Tzor’a and from Eshtaol,
to spy out the region and to explore it.
They said to them:
Go, explore the region!
So they came to the highlands of Efrayim, to the house of Mikha,
that they might spend the night there."
Judges 29:3,"They were near the house of Mikha
when they recognized the voice of the Levite lad,
so they turned aside there and said to him:
Who brought you here?
And what are you doing in this [place]? And what [business] do you have here?"
Judges 29:4,"He said to them:
Like this and like that has Mikha done for me;
he has hired me, and so I have become a priest for him."
Judges 29:5,"They said to him:
Pray inquire of God,
that we may know whether it will succeed, our way on which we are going."
Judges 29:6,"The priest said to them:
Go in peace—
straight before Y<small>HWH</small> is your way on which you are going!"
Judges 29:7,"So the five men went and came to Layish,
and they saw the men who were in its midst, settled in security in the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure,
with no one humiliating anyone in the region [or] barring an heir;
they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone."
Judges 29:8,"They came back to their brothers in Tzor’a and Eshtaol,
and their brothers said to them:
What do you [think]?"
Judges 29:9,"They said:
Arise and let us go up against them,
for we have seen the region, and here, it is exceedingly good.
But you are silent—
do not be sluggish to go, to enter and take possession of the region!"
Judges 29:10,"When you come [there], you will be coming to a people feeling-secure,
while the region is as broad as [outstretched] hands;
indeed, God will give it into your hands,
a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the region."
Judges 29:11,"So they marched from there, from the Danite clan, from Tzor’a and from Eshtaol,
six hundred men, girded in battle gear,"
Judges 29:12,"and they went up and encamped at Kiryat-Ye’arim, in Yehuda
—therefore they called that place Camp of Dan, until this day;
here, it is behind Kiryat-Ye’arim."
Judges 29:13,"They crossed through the highlands of Efrayim from there
and came as far as the house of Mikha;"
Judges 29:14,"then the five men spoke up, the ones going to spy out the region of Layish,
and said to their brothers:
Do you know that there are in these houses an <i>efod</i> and <i>terafim,</i>
and a carved and molten [idol]?
Now, know what you must do!"
Judges 29:15,"So they turned aside there and came to the house of the Levite lad, the house of Mikha,
and inquired after his welfare."
Judges 29:16,"Now six hundred men girded in battle gear were standing at the entrance to the gate, the ones from the Children of Dan,"
Judges 29:17,"while the five men going to spy out the region went up and they came there
[and] took the carved-image, the <i>efod,</i> the <i>terafim,</i> and the molten-image,
while the priest was standing at the entrance to the gate,
along with the six hundred men girded in battle gear."
Judges 29:18,"When these came to the house of Mikha and took the carved <i>efod,</i> the <i>terafim,</i> and the molten-image,
the priest said to them:
What are you doing?"
Judges 29:19,"They said to him:
Be still!
Put your hand over your mouth, and go with us,
and become a “father” and a priest for us!
Is it better, your being a priest for the house of one man,
or your being a priest for a tribe and a clan in Israel?"
Judges 29:20,"The heart of the priest was disposed-for-good,
so he took the <i>efod,</i> the <i>terafim,</i> and the carved-image, and came amid the fighting-people;"
Judges 29:21,"they faced about and went off,
and put the families and the livestock and the weighty-wealth in front of them."
Judges 29:22,"They had gone far from the house of Mikha
when the men who were in the houses that were near Mikha’s house mustered themselves and caught up with the Children of Dan;"
Judges 29:23,"they called out to the Children of Dan, and they turned their faces and said to Mikha:
What [ails] you, that you have mustered yourself?"
Judges 29:24,"He said:
My gods that I made, you have taken, along with the priest, and you have gone off!
What do I have anymore?
So why, now, do you say to me: What [ails] you?"
Judges 29:25,"The Children of Dan said to him:
Don’t make your voice heard among us,
lest men of bitter feelings attack you
and you have to lose your life-breath and the life-breath of your household!"
Judges 29:26,"So the Children of Dan went on their way;
and Mikha saw that they were stronger than he,
so he faced about and returned to his house."
Judges 29:27,"Now they took what Mikha had made and the priest that he had,
and came against Layish,
against a people quiet and secure,
and struck them with the mouth of the sword,
while the town they burned with fire."
Judges 29:28,"Now there was no rescuer, for it was far from Sidon,
and they had no dealings with anyone;
it was in the valley that belongs to Bet-Rehov.
They rebuilt the town and settled in it,"
Judges 29:29,"and they called the name of the town Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestral-father, who had been born to Yisrael;
however, Layish was the name of the town in former times."
Judges 29:30,"And the Children of Dan erected the carved-image for themselves,
while Yehonatan son of Gershom son of Moshe, he and his sons were priests for the Danite tribe, until the time of the exile of the land;

A scribe, unable at this point to erase the name and substitute another, clearly sought to remove any reference to Moshe as the ancestor of idolatrous priests, and came up with this “solution.” <b>exile of the land:</b> Kimhi reads <i>ha-aretz,</i> “land,” as <i>ha-aron,</i> “the Coffer,” referring to the capture of the Ark of the Covenant by the Philistines in I Sam. 4. But the phrase probably indicates the destruction of the Northern Kingdom, Israel, in 722 <small>B.C.E.</small>, and thus is yet another condemnation of the north in these texts.
The Nightmare at Giv’a: This notorious narrative, surely the most horrific nonmilitary story in the Hebrew Bible, launches the final three-chapter section of Judges. As we indicated above, it appears to be motivated by two factors: a desire to (1) demonstrate the sorry state of Israel’s polity in that era and (2) establish a link with the later House of Sha’ul (Saul), implying its own moral bankruptcy. Several editorial devices are used to connect this section to the previous one: first, the appearance of another Levite, whose character proves to be even worse than that of his predecessor. Yee sees these chapters as a polemic against “country Levites,” continuing the trend begun in Chap. 17. We will shortly encounter more corrupt priests, Eli’s sons, in I Sam. 2. A second possible link lies in the image of the nobles at the door, reminiscent of the six hundred Danites in the previous chapter, whose ominous presence at the town gate led to the appropriation of Mikha’s idols.
In order to portray moral decay, the chapter patterns itself after the Lot story of Gen. 19, but goes well beyond that narrative, which itself had a chilling outcome: the destruction of the cities of Sedom and Amora (Sodom and Gomorrah). Whereas in the earlier story the host also offered to surrender his women, here (v.24) he goes so far as to suggest rape (“force them or do to them whatever is good in your eyes”; the first two words are an addition to what appeared in Genesis), and the Levite actually pushes his concubine out the door. That, and the absence of protecting angels, would be enough to differentiate these two texts, but the telling detail is neither the comportment of the natives nor of the host, but rather the callous and self-centered behavior of the Levite himself. Despite his quest to get his concubine back at the beginning of the chapter, once he arrives at his father-in-law’s house he rarely acknowledges her existence; he is contemptuous of foreigners, and so declines to stay in Yevus for the night; he is complicit in the rape by pushing his concubine outside; and he never bothers to check if the violated body on the threshold is dead or alive. In contrast to the text’s mention of “refresh/humor the heart” multiple times in describing his father-in-law’s and his later host’s hospitality, the Levite is a man virtually without a heart. In the end we are left with a descendant of Aharon (Aaron) who, in a parody of priestly sacrificial behavior, “sections” (see Lev. 1:6) the abused woman whose bed he shared.
Klein notes that the Levite is anonymous and comes from the outlying area of his region. In addition, neither he nor the concubine’s father calls her to task for her sexual straying, unusual behavior for biblical males. And the purported host, who has seemed generous until now, and who is the Levite’s countryman, commits the unforgivable act of offering not only his daughters but also the Levite’s concubine to the mob.
In the end, the deeds done to the concubine are so vile that the writer feels compelled to break into a poetic rhetoric: “Never has there been, / never has been seen [anything]” like this act in all of Israelite history (v.30). It signals the collapse of societal standards, violating at one swoop the rules of hospitality and the proper sexual treatment of both men and women. Such a low point may be subtly hinted at by the description of the hours in vv.9–11: the day is “weakening,” “declining,” and “low,” a fitting characterization of Israel as well. But it is the dismembering of the concubine that ultimately suggests what has happened to Israel. The book of Samuel too will be replete with examples of bodily harm, and its accumulated tally of stricken body parts will also point to an unhealthy society (see the Introduction to Samuel later in this volume).
Perry tellingly notes that the narrative here embodies something further, which continues into the subsequent two chapters: the rejection of male warrior-based ideology. In his words, “God tries to teach the callous male union the hard way, at the expense of forty thousand dead, to hesitate, to be remorseful, to weep and have brotherly feelings toward the ‘enemy,’ to ‘play the woman’ (20:19–28).” The rare unification of the tribes takes place through gang rape and subsequent dismemberment.
Finally, as hinted at previously, attributing such behavior to the tribe of Binyamin, at the town of Giv’a, clearly implicates Sha’ul by association in the future. In addition, Israel’s first king begins his career by cutting up a brace of oxen and sending them all around the tribes, in order to rally them to battle. It is almost as if the subliminal message of the text is “In those days there was no king in Israel (17:6, 18:1, 19:1, 21:25), and Saul wouldn’t be much better either!” (Brettler 2001a)."
Judges 30:14,"they set up for themselves the carved-image of Mikha which he had made, all the days that the house of God was at Shilo."
Judges 31:1,"Now it was in those days,
when king there was none in Israel:
there was a Levite man, sojourning on the flanks of the highlands of Efrayim.
He took himself a concubine woman, from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda."
Judges 31:2,"But his concubine whored against him;
she went from him to her father’s house, to Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda,
and she remained there for a period of four months."
Judges 31:3,"And her husband arose and went after her,
to speak to her heart, to have her return
—his serving-lad was with him, along with a brace of donkeys.
She brought him into her father’s house,
and when the girl’s father saw him,
he rejoiced meeting him;"
Judges 31:4,"his father-in-law, the girl’s father, prevailed upon him,
so that he stayed with him for three days,
and they ate and drank and spent the night there."
Judges 31:5,"Now it was on the fourth day
that they started-early in the morning, and arose to go,
but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law:
Refresh your heart with a bit of bread;
afterward you may go!"
Judges 31:6,"So they stayed and ate, the two of them together, and they drank.
And the girl’s father said to the man:
Now consent to spend the night, so that your heart may be in good-humor!"
Judges 31:7,"The man arose to go,
but his father-in-law pressed him,
so that [once] again he spent the night there."
Judges 31:8,"He started early on the morning of the fifth day to go,
but the girl’s father said:
Now refresh your heart
and tarry until the lengthening of the day!
So the two of them ate."
Judges 31:9,"Then the man arose to go, he and his concubine and his serving-lad,
but his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him:
Here now, the day is weakening toward sunset;
now spend the night,
[for] here, the day is declining!
Spend the night here, so that your heart may be in good-humor;
you may start early on the morrow on your way, so that you may go back to your tent."
Judges 31:10,"But the man would not spend the night;
he arose and went and arrived at [a place] in front of Yevus—that is Jerusalem—and with him was a brace of loaded donkeys,
and his concubine was with him."
Judges 31:11,"They were near Yevus, and the day was exceedingly low,
so the serving-lad said to his lord:
Come now, let us turn aside to this Yevusite town and spend the night in it!"
Judges 31:12,"But his lord said to him:
We will not turn aside to a foreign town
in which none of the Children of Israel are here;
we will cross over as far as Giv’a."
Judges 31:13,"And he said to his serving-lad:
Come, let us go near one of the places
and spend the night in Giv’a or in Rama."
Judges 31:14,"So they crossed over and went,
and the sun came in on them alongside Giv’a, which belongs to Binyamin."
Judges 31:15,"They turned aside there, to come in to spend the night in Giv’a,
and they came and sat in the town square,
but no one was gathering them into the house to spend the night."
Judges 31:16,"Now here, an old man came in from his work, from the fields, at sunset
—the man was from the highlands of Efrayim, and he was sojourning in Giv’a,
while the men of the place were Binyaminites—"
Judges 31:17,"and he lifted up his eyes and saw the man, the wayfarer, in the town square;
the old man said:
Where are you going, and from where do you come?"
Judges 31:18,"He said to him:
We are crossing from Bet-Lehem [in] Yehuda as far as the flanks of the highlands of Efrayim
—I am from there;
I went to Bet-Lehem in Yehuda,
and to my house I am going back,
but no one will gather me into the house!"
Judges 31:19,"Yes, there is straw, yes, fodder for our donkeys, and yes, there are bread and wine for me and for your handmaid and for the serving-lad with your servants;
there is no lack of anything."
Judges 31:20,"The old man said:
Peace be to you!
Surely whatever you lack shall be on me,
for sure do not spend the night in the square!"
Judges 31:21,"He brought him into his house
and provided for the donkeys;
they washed their feet
and ate and drank."
Judges 31:22,"They were putting their hearts in good-humor
when here, the men of the city, base men, encircled the house;
they kept on beating against the door
and said to the man, the old house owner, saying:
Bring out the man who came into your house—
we want to know him!"
Judges 31:23,"But the man, the house owner, went out to them and said to them:
No, my brothers! Do not do evil, now!
Since this man came into my house,
do not do this vile thing!"
Judges 31:24,"Here are my nubile daughter and his concubine;
now let me bring them out—force them or do to them whatever is good in your eyes,
but to this man, do not do this vile thing!"
Judges 31:25,"But the men would not hearken to him,
so the man took hold of his concubine and pushed [her] out to them, outside,
and they knew her and abused her all night, until daybreak;
then they sent her away when the dawn came up."
Judges 31:26,"The woman came back toward daybreak
and fell down at the entrance of the house of the man where her lord was,
until [it was] light."
Judges 31:27,"Her lord arose at daybreak;
he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way—

Civil War: For once, Israel acts as a body (vv.1 and 11, “as one man”), but it is a unity born out of outrage and results in a near genocide. The narrative gathers steam from the Levite’s speech to the assembled men, and goes on to describe first the Israelites’ mustering and then that of the Binyaminites. The battle sequence is a long one, involving two successive defeats for the Israelites, who twice are also reduced to tears, just as at the beginning of the book (2:4). The third, and finally successful, attempt recalls the conquest of Ai in Josh. 8, both in the ambush tactics and in the initial delay. Since the victory in Joshua follows a major breach of faith (the Akhan story of Chap. 7), our text here might be suggesting that Israel needs to acknowledge God before they can proceed. The vocabulary of the chapter, which uses “turn around” twice and “face about” three times, literally reflects the turnaround in the events. As for the Binyaminites, whose reputation in war is cited a number of times in the Bible (see, for instance, Gen. 49:27), they might be seen as counterbalancing Chap. 3’s Ehud, another and more successful left-handed warrior.
and here, the woman, his concubine, was fallen down at the entrance to the house,
with her hands on the threshold!"
Judges 32:19,"He said to her:
Get up, let’s go!
But no one was answering.
So he took her up on the donkey,
and the man arose and went back to his place."
Judges 32:20,"He came to his house
and took a knife
and lay hold of his concubine
and chopped her up, into her limbs, into twelve chopped-pieces,
and sent her off throughout all the territory of Israel."
Judges 32:21,"And it was that all who saw it would say:
Never has there been, never has been seen [anything] like this
from the day of the Children of Israel’s going up from the land of Egypt until this day!
Take it [seriously] for yourselves, get counsel, and speak out!"
Judges 33:1,"So the Children of Israel went out
and the community assembled as one man, from Dan to Be’er-Sheva, including the land of Gil’ad, to Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa."
Judges 33:2,"And the “cornerstones” of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, stood forth,
in the assembly of the people of God,
four hundred thousand fighting-men, foot-soldiers drawing the sword."
Judges 33:3,"And the Children of Binyamin heard that the Children of Israel had gone up to Mitzpa.
The Children of Israel said:
Speak:
how did this evil come to be?"
Judges 33:4,"Then answered the Levite man, the husband of the murdered woman;
he said:
To Giv’a, which is in Binyamin, I came, I and my concubine, to spend the night,"
Judges 33:5,"but the landowners of Giv’a arose against me
and encircled the house against me at night;
me they intended to kill,
and my concubine they forced, so that she died."
Judges 33:6,"And so I grabbed my concubine,
I chopped her up
and sent her off throughout all the open-country of Israel’s hereditary-property,
for they did a lewd and vile [thing] in Israel!"
Judges 33:7,"Here, all of you, O Children of Israel:
give yourselves word and advice here!"
Judges 33:8,"And all the people arose as one man, saying:
We will not go back, anyone to his tent,
nor will we turn aside, anyone to his house!"
Judges 33:9,"Now: this is the thing that we will do to Giv’a:
[Go] against it by lot!"
Judges 33:10,"We will take ten men per hundred, for all the tribes of Israel,
and a hundred per thousand, and a thousand per myriad,
taking provisions for the fighting-people, to make ready to go against Giv’a of Binyamin,
in accordance with all the vileness that they have done in Israel!"
Judges 33:11,"So all the fighting-men of Israel gathered together against the town, as one man, confederates."
Judges 33:12,"And the tribes of Israel sent men among the entire tribe of Binyamin, saying:
What is this evil that came-about among you?"
Judges 33:13,"So-now, give over the men, the base ones, who are in Giv’a, that we may put them to death,
that we may eradicate evil from Israel!
But the Children of Binyamin would not hearken to the voice of their brothers, the Children of Israel,"
Judges 33:14,"and the Children of Binyamin gathered together from the towns to Giv’a
to go out for battle with the Children of Israel."
Judges 33:15,"And the Children of Binyamin were counted-for-war on that day, from the towns:
twenty-six thousand fighting-men drawing the sword;
aside from the settled-folk of Giv’a, seven hundred chosen men were counted,"
Judges 33:16,"from all these fighting-people, seven hundred chosen men, restricted in their right hand;
each of these could sling a stone at a hair and not miss."
Judges 33:17,"Now the fighting-men of Israel were counted, aside from Binyamin:
four hundred thousand men drawing the sword,
each of these a man of battle."
Judges 33:18,"They arose and went up to Bet-El, and inquired of God;
the Children of Israel said:
Who will go up for us first in battle with the Children of Binyamin?
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Yehuda first."
Judges 33:19,"The Children of Israel arose at daybreak
and encamped against Giv’a."
Judges 33:20,"And the fighting-men of Israel went out to battle with Binyamin;
the men of Israel arranged their ranks with them for battle at Giv’a."
Judges 33:21,"And the Children of Binyamin went out from Giv’a;
on that day they brought to ruin among Israel: twenty-two thousand men to the ground."
Judges 33:22,"But the fighting-people, the men of Israel, strengthened themselves,
and they again arranged ranks for battle
in the place where they had arranged [them] on the first day."
Judges 33:23,"And the Children of Israel went up
and wept in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, until sunset;
they inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>, saying:
Shall I again approach for battle with the Children of Binyamin my brother?
Y<small>HWH</small> said:
Go up against him."
Judges 33:24,"So the Children of Israel drew near to the Children of Binyamin on the second day,"
Judges 33:25,"and when Binyamin went out to meet them from Giv’a on the second day,
they brought to ruin among the Children of Israel another eighteen thousand men, to the ground,
all of these drawing the sword."
Judges 33:26,"Then all the Children of Israel went up, and all the fighting-people,
and came to Bet-El;
they wept and sat there, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and they fasted on that day until sunset
and offered up offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Judges 33:27,"And the Children of Israel inquired of Y<small>HWH</small>
—now the Coffer of God’s Covenant was there in those days,"
Judges 33:28,"and Pin’has son of El’azar son of Aharon was standing [in attendance] before it in those days—
saying:
Shall I once again go out for battle with the Children of Binyamin my brother,
or shall I hold back?
Y<small>HWH</small> said:

Judges 33:29,So Israel set ambushes against Giv’a all around.

and arranged-ranks against Giv’a as time and time [before];"
Judges 33:31,"and when the Children of Binyamin went out to meet the fighting-people,
they were torn away from the town
and began to strike down some of the people, [leaving] slain as time and time [before] on the highways
—of which one goes up to Bet-El and one to Giv’a, in the open-country—
about thirty men in Israel."
Judges 33:32,"The Children of Binyamin said:
They are beaten before us, as at the beginning!
But the Children of Israel said:
Let us flee and tear them away from the town, onto the highways!"
Judges 33:33,"Now when all the fighting-men of Israel had risen from their place
and had arranged-ranks at Baal Tamar,
the ambush of Israel burst forth from its place, from the Giv’a Cave,"
Judges 33:34,"while from opposite Giv’a came ten thousand men, chosen ones from all Israel.
Now the battle was heavy,
but they did not know that evil-fortune was [already] reaching them."
Judges 33:35,"So Y<small>HWH</small> defeated Binyamin before Israel,
and the Children of Israel brought to ruin among the Children of Binyamin on that day
twenty-five thousand and a hundred men,
all of these drawing the sword.

Judges 33:36,"<b>Get up:</b> Elsewhere, I use “arise” for this verb, but that feels too formal here. This is the most repulsive line in the whole story; can he think of nothing else to say after she has been raped and abused all night?"
Judges 33:37,"<b>knife:</b> Specifically, a large knife or a cleaver. It derives from the verb “to eat/devour,” which is also found in the common biblical idiom for destruction by the sword (and which uses “mouth” for “edge”). The same word describes Avraham’s knife, intended for his son’s throat in Gen. 22:6, 10. <b>chopped her up … sent her off:</b> Sha’ul does the same thing with an ox (I Sam. 11:7) in order to rally the Israelites to battle. The narrator here, unlike the husband, chooses to retain the last shred of the woman’s dignity by referring to the cut-up pieces as “her.” Or it may be bitterly ironic—what of “her” is left?"
Judges 33:38,"<b>Never has there been, never has been seen:</b> Heb. <i>lo nihyeta ve-lo nir’ata.</i>"
Judges 34:1,"<b>from Dan to Be’er-Sheva:</b> The classic expression of Israel’s ideal boundaries (see I Kings 5:5), it is the moral equivalent of America’s “from sea to shining sea.” <b>Mitzpa:</b> Trad. English “Mizpah,” the site of a centralized shrine to Y<small>HWH</small> a few miles from Giv’a. It became important mainly after the Babylonian Exile in the sixth century."
Judges 34:2,"<b>“cornerstones”:</b> A metaphorical term for “chieftains.” <b>four hundred thousand:</b> Clearly an exaggeration, as often in biblical and other ancient texts."
Judges 34:3,<b>intended:</b> The Hebrew denotes “conceiving an image” (Gray 1986). <b>my concubine they forced:</b> He conveniently leaves out his act of pushing her out to them (Klein).

The Replenishing of Binyamin: Using the Wild West analogy I drew in the Introduction to Judges, a possible subtitle to this chapter might be “700 Brides for 700 Brothers.” According to one view, Judges ends, appropriately, in a state of confusion. In short order, the text has moved from the gang rape of one woman to the near extermination of a tribe, and on to the abduction of hundreds of women. The nation, such as it is, has been saved, but at the cost of massive violence of several kinds. Fathers and husbands are unable to give women even the most basic protection (Schneider). Thus the dismembered concubine remains as a symbol of Israel’s body politic, an observation borne out by the final two verses of the chapter, in which we hear the Hebrew word/English phrase “each [one]” (as opposed to the group) three times.
While on the surface Israel is made whole again (see Niditch 2008 for this positive view on the tone of the chapter), we know that this cannot possibly last. The two subsequent books, Samuel and Kings, will portray an Israel that is irrevocably split, with the contentious tribe of Binyamin containing Jerusalem at the center of the land.
The chapter’s links to future texts are major geographical ones. The Yavesh-Gil’ad of v.9 is the town that appeals to Israel for help in I Sam. 11 and is rescued by Sha’ul, while Shilo (v.12) will be the site of events in the very next chapter (I Sam. 1). The appearance of Shilo also functions as a preparation for the “questionable events” that occur with Eli’s sons (Amit 1999a).
Amit also notes the bracketing effect of this chapter: both here and in Chap. 2, Yevus (Jerusalem) is mentioned, along with weeping and sacrifices, and “each [one] to his hereditary-property” (2:6 and 21:25). She attributes this to the final editor’s desire to smooth over the rough edges created by the interpolation of Chaps. 17–21."
Judges 34:17,"The Children of Binyamin saw that they were defeated,
and the fighting-men of Israel gave ground to Binyamin,
for they were secure regarding the ambush that they had set at Giv’a."
Judges 34:18,"Now the ambush they hurried along and spread out against Giv’a,
and the ambush drew out
and struck the entire city with the mouth of the sword."
Judges 34:19,"Now the arrangement for the men of Israel with the ambush had been
to send up a rising-mass of smoke from the city;"
Judges 34:20,"then the men of Israel were to turn around in battle.
And Binyamin had begun to strike, [leaving] slain among Israel about thirty men;
indeed, they said:
Surely, he is defeated, yes, defeated before us, as in the beginning battle!"
Judges 34:21,"But the rising-mass began to go up from the town—a column of smoke;
Binyamin faced about behind him
and here, the whole of the town went up [in smoke] to the heavens!"
Judges 34:22,"The men of Israel turned around,
and the men of Binyamin were terrified,
for they saw that evil-fortune was reaching them."
Judges 34:23,"So they faced about before the men of Israel toward the way of the wilderness,
but the battle caught up with them;
whoever was from the town, they brought him to ruin in its midst:"
Judges 34:24,"they encircled Binyamin and they pursued him
—to Menuha they forced him along—
up to [a spot] opposite Giv’a, toward the rising of the sun."
Judges 34:25,"And there fell of Binyamin eighteen thousand men,
all these, men of valor."
Judges 34:26,"They faced about and fled to the wilderness, to the Rimmon Crag,
but they picked them off on the highways,
five thousand men;
they caught up with them as far as Gid’om/Hewing Them,
and struck down from them two thousand men."
Judges 34:27,"And all those who fell from Binyamin were twenty-five thousand men drawing the sword on that day,
all these, men of valor."
Judges 34:28,"They faced about and fled to the wilderness, to the Rimmon Crag: six hundred men,
and they stayed at the Rimmon Crag for four months."
Judges 34:29,"Now the men of Israel returned to the Children of Binyamin and struck them with the mouth of the sword,
from the men of the town to the cattle and to all that was found,
and also all the towns that were found they sent up in fire."
Judges 35:1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mitzpa, saying:
Let no man among us give his daughter to Binyamin as a wife!"
Judges 35:2,"And the fighting-people came to Bet-El,
and sat there until sunset, in the presence of God;
they lifted up their voices and wept, a great weeping,"
Judges 35:3,"and they said:
Why, O Y<small>HWH</small>, God of Israel, did this happen in Israel,
for one tribe to be accounted [missing] today from Israel?"
Judges 35:4,"So it was on the morrow that the people started early
and built a sacrificial-altar there,
and they offered up offerings-up and <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
Judges 35:5,"And the Children of Israel said:
Who is it that did not go up among the assembly from all the tribes of Israel to Y<small>HWH</small>?
For the great sworn-oath was against anyone who did not go up to Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa, saying:
He shall be put to death, yes, death!"
Judges 35:6,"And the Children of Israel felt regret toward Binyamin their brother;
they said:
Hewn off today is one tribe from Israel!"
Judges 35:7,"What can we do for them, for those left, regarding wives?
For we ourselves have sworn by Y<small>HWH</small>
not to give them any of our daughters as wives!"
Judges 35:8,"And they said:
Which is the one from the tribes of Israel that did not go up to Y<small>HWH</small> at Mitzpa?
Now here, not a man had come to the camp from Yavesh-Gil’ad, to the assembly."
Judges 35:9,"The people were counted,
and here, there was not a man there from the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad."
Judges 35:10,"So the community sent there twelve thousand men of the valiant ones,
and they charged them, saying:
Go and strike down the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad with the mouth of the sword,
along with the women and the little-ones!"
Judges 35:11,"And this is the thing that you are to do:
every male, and every woman [who] has known lying with a male, you are to devote-to-destruction."
Judges 35:12,"They found among the settled-folk of Yavesh-Gil’ad four hundred nubile girls
who had not known a man by lying with a male,
and they brought them to the camp at Shilo, which is in the land of Canaan."
Judges 35:13,"And the entire community sent
and spoke to the Children of Binyamin who were at Rimmon Crag;
they called out to them: Peace!"
Judges 35:14,"So the Children of Binyamin returned at that time,
and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive among the women of Yavesh-Gil’ad;
but they did not find enough for them thus."
Judges 35:15,"Now the people had felt regret toward Binyamin,
since Y<small>HWH</small> had made a breach among the tribes of Israel,"
Judges 35:16,"so the elders of the community said:
What are we to do with those left, for wives?
—for [the] women were wiped out from Binyamin!"
Judges 35:17,"They said:
[There must be] a surviving possession for Binyamin,
so that a tribe in Israel not be wiped out!"
Judges 35:18,"Now as for us, we are not able to give them wives from our daughters,
—for the Children of Israel had sworn, saying:
Doomed be the one giving a wife to Binyamin!—"
Judges 35:19,"so they said:
Here, there is the pilgrimage-festival of Y<small>HWH</small> at Shilo—year after year—
that is north of Bet-El, toward the rising of the sun from the highway that goes up from Bet-El to Shekhem, and south of Levona."
Judges 35:20,"So they charged the Children of Binyamin, saying:
Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,"
Judges 35:21,"and see: here, if the daughters of Shilo go out to dance in the dances,
you are to go out from the vineyards
and are to catch for yourselves, each one, his wife from the daughters of Shilo;
then you may go back to the land of Binyamin."
Judges 35:22,"So it will be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us
that we will say to them:
Be gracious to them,
for haven’t we taken, each one, his wife in battle?
For if you yourselves had given [them] to them,
[then] at that time you would have incurred-guilt."
Judges 35:23,"So the Children of Binyamin did thus:
they took up wives according to their number
from the dancers whom they kidnapped;
then they went and returned to their hereditary-property
and rebuilt the towns, and settled in them."
Judges 35:24,"And the Children of Israel went off from there at that time,
each one to his tribe and to his clan,
and each one went out from there to his hereditary-property."
Judges 35:25,"In those days, there was no king in Israel;
each one would do what was right in his eyes.
