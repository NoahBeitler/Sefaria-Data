Ii Samuel 1:7,<b>chanced:</b> Casting doubt on his story; people do not usually happen upon battles.
Ii Samuel 1:8,"<b>diadem … bracelet:</b> These constitute Sha’ul’s “royal insignia” (McCarter 1984), and hence would have served as proof that the Amalekite had encountered the king."

Ii Samuel 1:13,"<b>the Record of the Upright:</b> An ancient collection of poems or songs, to which Josh. 10:13 also refers.

Ii Samuel 1:14,<b>beauty:</b> Or “gazelle.”
Ii Samuel 1:15,"<b>surging of the [watery] deeps:</b> Suggested by Greenstein, private communication, following an emendation by H. L. Ginsberg (<i>shera’ tehomot</i> for <i>sedei terumot</i>). "

Ii Samuel 2:5,"<b>Ish-Boshet:</b> Trad. English “Ishbosheth.” The original name was “Ish-Baal,” “Man of Baal“; scribal tradition, uncomfortable with the pagan overtones, has changed it (and similar names—see 11:21, which originally read “Yerubbaal”) to a name meaning “Man of Shame.” "
Ii Samuel 2:6,"<b>Mahanayim:</b> On the east bank of the Jordan, east of Shekhem."
Ii Samuel 2:7,"<b>Gil’ad:</b> The region in which Mahanayim is located, east of the Jordan, between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. "

Ii Samuel 2:12,<b>Giv’on:</b> Northwest of Jerusalem; trad. English “Gibeon.”
Ii Samuel 2:13,"<b>hold-a-contest:</b> This seems to indicate a ritual winner-take-all combat. The Hebrew verb (<i>s-h-k</i>) is the same as that used in Judg. 16:25 to describe the blind Shimshon’s “providing amusement” for the Philistines; B-R translate both with “dance” (here, “do a war dance”)."

None will ultimately survive to become king; that will fall to Shelomo (Solomon). Avshalom (<i>ahv-shah-LOME</i>) is trad. English “Absalom,” while Adoniyya (<i>ah-doe-nee-YAH</i>) is “Adonijah.”"
Ii Samuel 3:3,"<b>Talmai:</b> Avshalom will flee to this maternal grandfather in Chap. 1. He rules over a northern realm east of the Jordan (and thus David’s marriage to his daughter Ma’akha was a political act, as many have noted)."
Ii Samuel 3:4,<b>war:</b> See note to v.1 above. 
Ii Samuel 3:5,<b>gaining strength:</b> Or political power.
Ii Samuel 3:6,"<b>concubine:</b> A second-level wife, often a slave woman. The institution does not seem to have been widely practiced in ancient Israel. "

Ii Samuel 4:3,<b>Gittayim:</b> Further west of Be’erot. The name means “Double-Winepress.”

Ii Samuel 4:6,<b>feet:</b> Or “legs”; biblical Hebrew does not make the distinction.

Ii Samuel 5:6,"<b>reaches the water-shaft:</b> That is, conquering the city through its water supply. B-R and McCarter (194) read “should attack at the windpipe,” but such a usage is not attested elsewhere. In any event the passage is difficult, and words appear to be missing."

Ii Samuel 5:8,<b>God:</b> Missing in some ancient versions.

Ii Samuel 5:10,<b>Natan:</b> Pronounced <i>nah-TAHN;</i> trad. English “Nathan.” This is not the important court prophet who appears first in Chap. 7. The name is notable in its echoing of David’s dear friend Yehonatan.

Ii Samuel 5:12,<b>they had anointed:</b> The Israelites.

Ii Samuel 6:2,<b>Baala:</b> Identical to Kiryat-Ye’arim (see Josh. 15:9). 
Ii Samuel 6:3,"<b>the name:</b> The text is jumbled and perhaps a scribal error; MT reads “the Name, the Name.” Adding to the problems with that word, <i>shem</i>, is <i>sham</i>, “there,” earlier in the verse. "
Ii Samuel 6:4,"<b>[The One] Seated on the Winged-Sphinxes:</b> A title of Y<small>HWH</small>, enthroned as king, as in I Sam. 4:4."
Ii Samuel 6:5,"<b>new wagon:</b> See note to I 6:7, above.

Ii Samuel 6:9,<b>because of [his] carelessness:</b> Following some ancient witnesses; others indicate a longer text (I Chron. 13:10: “he stretched out his hand to the Coffer”).
Ii Samuel 6:10,<b>burst forth:</b> The same verb had been used to describe God’s power in 5:20.
Ii Samuel 6:11,"<b>Oved-Edom the Gittite:</b> Interestingly, it is a foreigner’s house that is blessed. His name means “Servant of Edom, native of Gat.”"
Ii Samuel 6:12,"<b>an ox and a fatling:</b> McCarter (1984) takes this as a hendiadys, where two nouns in sequence connected by “and” are understood as a noun and an adjective, hence “a fatted bull.”"
Ii Samuel 6:13,"<b>an <i>efod</i> of linen:</b> A common loincloth, not a priestly vestment (McCarter 1984)."
Ii Samuel 6:14,<b>leaping and whirling:</b> I could not find an adequate English equivalent for the aurally dynamic <i>mefazzez um’kharker</i>.

Ii Samuel 6:17,"<b>in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> As in vv.3–4, the doublet in this verse suggests a scribal mistake."
Ii Samuel 6:18,<b>with <i>them</i> I’ll get honor:</b> A sarcastic sexual reference.

Ii Samuel 7:3,"<b>to stay in:</b> Lit., “for my staying in/inhabiting.”"
Ii Samuel 7:4,"<b>in Tent and in Dwelling:</b> See the second half of the book of Exodus, from Chap. 25 onward."

Ii Samuel 7:6,"<b>Y<small>HWH</small> … Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The repetition is strange, probably a scribal error."

Ii Samuel 7:13,"<b>found his heart to pray:</b> Speech originates in the heart (Greenstein, written communication)."
Ii Samuel 7:14,<b>spoken this good [thing]:</b> Not merely “good words”; this is covenant language in Israel and elsewhere in the ancient Near East (McCarter 1984 and others).
Ii Samuel 8:1,<b>Meteg Amma:</b> Following recent translations. The Hebrew is obscure; reading it as <i>mgt h’amh</i> would yield “from Gat to Amma.”
Ii Samuel 8:2,"<b>he measured them:</b> That is, he decided which of the prisoners were to die."
Ii Samuel 8:3,"<b>Hadad:</b> Pronounced <i>hah-DAHD</i>. An ancient Near Eastern storm god, usually identified with Baal. "
Ii Samuel 8:4,<b>the River:</b> The Euphrates.

Ii Samuel 9:9,"<b>David’s table:</b> MT has “my table,” while a manuscript reads “our table.”"
Ii Samuel 9:10,<b>Mikha:</b> Pronounced <i>mee-KHAH;</i> trad. English “Micah.” The previous bearer of this name was the morally compromised protagonist of Judg. 17–18.

Ii Samuel 11:4,"<b>his lying-place:</b> More simply, “his bed,” but I have sought to retain the key verb “lie” in the translation. Evidently David has been sleeping, or resting, from the time of the early afternoon nap on. "
Ii Samuel 11:5,"<b>fair:</b> Lit., “good/goodly.” The other biblical characters who are described as “fair to look at” are Rivka (Rebecca) and Ester (Esther)."

Ii Samuel 11:8,"<b>Uriyya the Hittite:</b> Pronounced <i>oo-ree-YAH;</i> trad. English “Uriah.” He was a high-ranking soldier in David’s army. The name is ironically a pious Israelite one, meaning “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Light.” The Hittites mentioned here are not to be confused with the earlier great empire in Anatolia (modern Turkey); as in Gen. 2, the term probably refers to a local Canaanite group."
Ii Samuel 11:9,<b>purified herself:</b> The verb <i>kiddeish</i> in other contexts denotes “hallowing”; here it is simply the non-priestly word for purification. 
Ii Samuel 11:10,"<b>her state-of-<i>tum’a:</i></b> Bat-Sheva’s washing occurs at the end of her menstrual period, during which intercourse would have been forbidden because of ritual pollution (<i>tum’a;</i> see Lev. 18:19). It means that the forthcoming child could not be Uriyya’s. Bat-Sheva is here also at her most fertile, twelve days or so after the onset of menstruation."

Ii Samuel 11:16,"<b>Avimelekh son of Yerubboshet:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-vee-MEH-lekh;</i> trad. English “Abimelech.” The reference is to a son of Gid’on who in Judg. 9 proclaims himself king over the men of Shekhem and, not surprisingly, meets an untoward end. Yoav’s message, if delivered, would be a not-so-subtle dig at David’s behavior, by citing another well-known royal disaster involving a woman. "
Ii Samuel 11:17,"<b>riding millstone:</b> The rolling portion of a millstone apparatus, thus a reasonably heavy stone."
Ii Samuel 11:18,<b>shooters:</b> Archers.
Ii Samuel 11:19,"<b>like this and like that the sword devours:</b> Equivalent to “That’s the way it goes.” The focus on eating imagery recurs throughout the story (see 11:13, 12:16–17, 20). "

Ii Samuel 11:21,<b>Uriyya’s wife:</b> She is not called “Bat-Sheva” again until David’s crime has been punished by the death of their child (12:24).

Ii Samuel 12:6,<b>son of death:</b> Deserving death (although McCarter 1984 reads it as signifying something like “scoundrel”).
Ii Samuel 12:7,"<b>fourfold:</b> In keeping with the law in Exod. 21:37. On the other hand, LXX’s reading “sevenfold” fits in nicely with the other sevens in the story, including the one suggested by the <i>Sheva</i> part of the female character’s name."
Ii Samuel 12:8,<b>You are the man!:</b> Or “The man is you!”
Ii Samuel 12:9,<b>your lord:</b> Sha’ul.
Ii Samuel 12:10,"<b>[person]:</b> As mentioned above, the words of this verse rhyme, somewhat unusually for biblical poetry, so I have sought to have each line end with “your ___.” "
Ii Samuel 12:11,<b>under the eyes of this sun:</b> In broad daylight.
Ii Samuel 12:12,<b>you did it in secret:</b> Heb. <i>asita va-sater</i>.
Ii Samuel 12:13,"<b>“Y<small>HWH</small>’s enemies”:</b> Later scribes were not comfortable with the phrase “scorned Y<small>HWH</small>,” so they added the “enemies” to blunt the sense."
Ii Samuel 12:14,<b>evil:</b> Harm (to himself).
Ii Samuel 12:15,"<b>arose … washed … :</b> Kwitkin-Close (written communication) notes the breathlessness of David’s actions here, via a long string of consecutive verb forms. "
Ii Samuel 12:16,"<b>poured [oil on himself]:</b> See 14:2, below. Omitting this practice earlier indicated mourning; the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, which mimics a situation of death, still includes “anointing” on the list of forbidden actions."
Ii Samuel 12:17,"<b>comforted:</b> The same verb applied to David (unknowingly, by himself) in v.6, meaning “pitied.” "
Ii Samuel 12:18,"<b>Peace:</b> Perhaps short for “Y<small>HWH</small>’s Peace.” Alternatively, it may signify “Replacement” (for the dead child)."
Ii Samuel 12:19,"<b>Yedidya:</b> The name signifies “Beloved of Y<small>HWH</small>,” rather like the meaning of “David,” and thus hints at a resolution to the story."
Ii Samuel 12:20,<b>water city:</b> Heb. unclear; a JPS note conjectures “perhaps the source of the water supply.”
Ii Samuel 12:21,"<b>lest … my own name be called over it:</b> In that case David would miss out on the credit, which would be politically inappropriate."
Ii Samuel 12:22,"<b>pass through:</b> Or, with a slight letter change, “put to work at.”"
Ii Samuel 13:1,"<b>Avshalom:</b> Pronounced <i>ahv-shah-LOM</i>. The name combines “Father” (figuratively God, or actually David) and “Peace/Well-being.” "

Ii Samuel 13:3,<b>Amnon:</b> Pronounced <i>ahm-NOHN</i>. Tamar and Avshalom’s half brother and heir to the throne. His name ironically connotes “faithful.”
Ii Samuel 13:4,"<b>nubile-girl:</b> As with Jephthah’s daughter in Judg. 1, the word <i>betula</i> here probably refers to a young woman of marriageable age rather than to a virgin per se; the reason for Tamar’s being forbidden to Amnon appears to lie elsewhere (Wenham). "
Ii Samuel 13:5,<b>to do anything:</b> To have sexual contact.
Ii Samuel 13:6,<b>Yonadav:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-nah-DAHV;</i> trad. English “Jonadab.” In v.5 the name has the alternate “Yehonadav.” 
Ii Samuel 13:7,<b>worldly-wise:</b> Heb. <i>h-k-m</i> connotes not only intellectual but also practical wisdom. See also 14:2ff. and 20:16 below.
Ii Samuel 13:8,"<b>Tamar—the sister …:</b> McCarter (198) notes how each word in this verse begins with the same letter (<i>alef</i>), producing “a series of gasping sighs,” and Rendsburg (1998–99) includes it as an example of (emotionally) “confused language.”"
Ii Samuel 13:9,"<b>heat … heartcakes:</b> Heb. <i>u-tlabbev levivot</i>. The verb appears also in the Song of Songs (4:9), to indicate sexual arousal. "
Ii Samuel 13:10,"<b>heartcakes:</b> Heb. <i>levivot;</i> others, simply “cakes,” but the “heart” (Heb. <i>leiv, leivav</i>) motif is central to the Avshalom stories, as I have argued in the Introduction to this section. Shaped foods were known in the ancient Near East (Prof. Chaim Cohen, personal communication)."
Ii Samuel 13:11,<b>Have everyone go out:</b> The equivalent of “Clear the room!”
Ii Samuel 13:12,"<b>overpowered:</b> Or “took hold of.”
12–13 <b>such is not to be done … disgrace:</b> The same language is used in Gen. 34, the rape of Dina narrative. <b>vile thing … vile ones:</b> As in I Sam. 25; others understand as “foolishness … fools.” <b>he will not withhold me:</b> In order for her plea to have any force, such a thing must have been possible in royal society. Yet, as Sasson shows, it does not appear much outside of Egypt. He makes the intriguing conjecture that Tamar may have in fact been Avshalom’s daughter (see 14:27) and therefore Amnon’s niece, which would solve a number of the story’s problems."
Ii Samuel 13:13,<b>Get up! Go!:</b> With the force of “Get lost!” The wording is close to the horrifying “Get up! Let’s go!” that the Levite of Judg. 19:28 barks at his gang-raped and unconscious (if not dead) concubine.
Ii Samuel 13:14,"<b>About this great evil …:</b> The halting syntax here may be less a function of a defective text, as some have maintained, and more of Tamar’s emotional state (Kwitkin-Close, written communication, and Rendsburg 1998–99)."
Ii Samuel 13:15,<b>this one:</b> Note how the phrasing suggests contempt.
Ii Samuel 13:16,<b>ornamented tunic:</b> Like Joseph’s famous one in Gen. 37:3.
Ii Samuel 13:17,<b>For now:</b> Following Alter (1999).
Ii Samuel 13:18,<b>agitated:</b> Yet he apparently does not act further.
Ii Samuel 13:19,<b>Baal Hatzor:</b> Well north of Jerusalem. 
Ii Samuel 13:20,<b>Efrayim:</b> Presumably the name of another town; McCarter (1984) suggests an original name of “Ofra.”
Ii Samuel 13:21,<b>merry:</b> Elsewhere I use “in good-humor.”
Ii Samuel 13:22,"<b>mouth:</b> Or, as elsewhere, “order.”"
Ii Samuel 13:23,<b>Talmai:</b> His maternal grandfather.
Ii Samuel 13:24,"<b>the king’s spirit was spent for going out against:</b> MT has “David the King longed for,” but the verb is feminine, like “spirit” (<i>ru’ah</i>) in Hebrew, and “David” (Heb. <i>d-w-d</i>) could easily be an orthographic error for “spirit” (<i>r-w-h</i>). Some interpreters feel that David really is pining for Avshalom, but, as Alter (1999) points out, in the next chapter the king refuses to see him. "
Ii Samuel 13:25,"<b>for he was dead:</b> Perhaps another indication of David’s ability to “move on” (see his reaction to his illegitimate son’s death in Chap. 12)—not necessarily an admirable trait, in this case."
Ii Samuel 14:1,
Ii Samuel 14:2,"<b>Tekoa:</b> South of Bet-Lehem, or about ten miles south of Jerusalem, on the border between farmland and the desert. "
Ii Samuel 14:3,"<b>a worldly-wise woman:</b> Another one appears at the end of the stories concerning Avshalom, Chap. 20. The Bible uses this kind of bracketing structure fairly often. "
Ii Samuel 14:4,"<b>pour oil:</b> The application of oil was considered a part of personal hygiene in the ancient world. See note on 12:20, above."
Ii Samuel 14:5,"<b>your handmaid:</b> Showing suitable deference, by the speaker’s referring to herself in the third person."
Ii Samuel 14:6,"<b>Even the heir!:</b> Implying either that they don’t care that he <i>is</i> his father’s heir, or that they want to kill him for the property as well (Alter 1999). "
Ii Samuel 14:7,"<b>my ember that remains:</b> In a memorable image, the last one left to carry on the family name. "
Ii Samuel 14:8,<b>survivor:</b> Or “remnant.”
Ii Samuel 14:9,<b>too much:</b> The Hebrew is difficult here. 
Ii Samuel 14:10,<b>blood redeemer:</b> A member of a family or clan whose duty it was to avenge the death of a kinsman. 
Ii Samuel 14:11,<b>a hair of your son:</b> Avshalom’s own abundant hair will ultimately prove his undoing.
Ii Samuel 14:12,"<b>he will plan plans:</b> JPS understands the phrase to mean that God will not punish David, the one who “plans plans.”"
Ii Samuel 14:13,"<b>God’s inheritance:</b> Unlike the “Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance” in I Sam. 26:19 and II Sam. 20:19 and 21:3, this expression appears to refer to the ancestral estate (Lewis), or “the hereditary-property” from God."
Ii Samuel 14:14,<b>my lord is wise:</b> Yet David’s ambiguous actions vis-à-vis Avshalom indicate that royal wisdom and control are in the process of unraveling.
Ii Samuel 14:15,"<b>no defect:</b> The language describes an animal fit for sacrifice, or a priest qualified to serve in the sanctuary."
Ii Samuel 14:16,"<b>Tamar:</b> Strikingly, Avshalom names his only daughter after his raped sister."
Ii Samuel 14:17,"<b>time:</b> Lit., “of days.”"
Ii Samuel 14:18,"<b>any iniquity:</b> Yet in just a few verses, Avshalom will begin the process of usurping his father’s throne."
Ii Samuel 15:1,"<b>fifty men running before him:</b> Usually taken as a sign of his pretensions to the throne, this may also have the function of keeping the horses calm in the face of a crowd (Cantrell)."
Ii Samuel 15:2,<b>you have no one to hear:</b> McCarter (1984): “You will get no hearing.”
Ii Samuel 15:3,<b>four:</b> Following some LXX manuscripts; MT has “forty.”
Ii Samuel 15:4,"<b>spy-runners:</b> Following B-R; from Heb. <i>regel</i>, “foot” (see Gen. 42:9)."
Ii Samuel 15:5,"<b>Ahitofel:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-hee-TOE-fel</i>. The meaning of the name is unclear, but it seems a bit like the word for “folly” (Heb. <i>t-p-l</i>). "
Ii Samuel 15:6,<b>Gilo:</b> A town probably to the southwest of Hevron. 
Ii Samuel 15:7,<b>went on … becoming many:</b> Their number increased.
Ii Samuel 15:8,"<b>push evil:</b> The same Hebrew verb translated by “banished” in the previous chapter. The Hebrew here is probably corrupt; LXX reads <i>ha-raa</i> (“the evil/misfortune”) as <i>ha-’ir</i> (“the city”), thus “push the city down upon us,” following McCarter (1984)."
Ii Samuel 15:9,<b>here are your servants:</b> We are ready to do your bidding.
Ii Samuel 15:10,<b>the Far House:</b> Presumably at the edge of the city.
Ii Samuel 15:11,"<b>Kereitites … Peleitites … Gittites:</b> See note to 8:, above."
Ii Samuel 15:12,"<b>Ittai:</b> Pronounced <i>ee-TIE</i>. It sounds like the phrase “with me” (Heb. <i>itti</i>), appropriate in a passage about loyalty (Garsiel 85, Polzin 93)."
Ii Samuel 15:13,"<b>in loyalty:</b> The text appears to be defective. Others, including ancients, add “May Y<small>HWH</small> show you loyalty …”"
Ii Samuel 15:14,"<b>families:</b> Elsewhere, “little-ones,” but Heb. <i>taf</i> may include children and old people—namely, stragglers or dependents."
Ii Samuel 15:15,<b>in a great voice:</b> Loudly. 
Ii Samuel 15:16,<b>Wadi Kidron:</b> The valley separating the (old) city of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives.
Ii Samuel 15:17,"<b>set down:</b> Reading <i>va-yatzigu</i> for MT <i>va-yatziku</i>, “poured out” (see McCarter 1984)."
Ii Samuel 15:18,<b>Are you a seer?:</b> Heb. unclear; some take this as a sarcastic remark.
Ii Samuel 15:19,<b>from you:</b> Plural.

Ii Samuel 15:24,<b>annul:</b> Or “defeat.”

Ii Samuel 16:2,<b>Bahurim:</b> A village on the east side of the Mount of Olives. 
Ii Samuel 16:3,<b>Shim’i:</b> Pronounced <i>shim-EE;</i> trad. English “Shimei.”
Ii Samuel 16:4,<b>along with all the fighting-people:</b> Shim’i’s disregard of the heavily armed force accompanying David shows the depth of his hatred for the king (Ehrlich).
Ii Samuel 16:5,<b>bloodguilty man:</b> “Blood” here is in an expanded form (Heb. <i>damim</i> instead of <i>dam</i>); B-R translate as “man of bloody deeds.”
Ii Samuel 16:6,"<b>you are in your evil-fate:</b> That is, you are experiencing misfortune."
Ii Samuel 16:7,<b>who came out of my body:</b> A rather male point of view. 
Ii Samuel 16:8,<b>the Binyaminite:</b> Shim’i.
Ii Samuel 16:9,<b>affliction:</b> Following ancient versions.
Ii Samuel 16:10,"<b>dumping dust:</b> Lit., “bedusting (him with) dust” (Heb. <i>’ippar be-’afar</i>)."
Ii Samuel 16:11,"<b>David’s Friend:</b> This may be a title/office, that is, “Companion of the King.”"
Ii Samuel 16:12,"<b>Come in to your father’s concubines:</b> As suggested previously, usurping the sexual bed of the father appears elsewhere as a method of symbolically taking power by the son; see Gen. 35:22. Here it is the fulfillment of Natan’s prophecy of 12:11, above."
Ii Samuel 16:13,<b>like inquiring of the word of God:</b> Like an oracle.
Ii Samuel 17:1,
Ii Samuel 17:2,<b>slack of hands:</b> See 4:1 above.
Ii Samuel 17:3,<b>[so that] when …:</b> The Hebrew is unclear; LXX adds after “return”: “to you as a bride returns to her husband; you seek only one man’s life …” 
Ii Samuel 17:4,<b>peace:</b> Again playing on Avshalom’s name.
Ii Samuel 17:5,<b>The word:</b> Of advice.
Ii Samuel 17:6,<b>a bear bereaved:</b> Bar-Efrat and others see the mention of the bear here and the lion in v.10 as recalling the youthful David (see I 17:34–37).
Ii Samuel 17:7,<b>fighting-people fall:</b> According to some ancient versions; MT has “fall in them.”
Ii Samuel 17:8,"<b>among them:</b> So ancient versions; MT reads “in battle,” i.e., leading the troops."
Ii Samuel 17:9,<b>light … as dew:</b> This is usually an image of peace; here it smells of death (Alter 1999).
Ii Samuel 17:10,"<b>En-Rogel:</b> Pronounced <i>ayn ro-GAYL</i>, a spring south of Jerusalem’s main Gihon Spring. The name means “Fuller’s/Washer’s Spring,” referring to a person whose task it is to clean, dye, shrink, or expand cloth."
Ii Samuel 17:11,"<b>noticeable:</b> Lit., “known.”"
Ii Samuel 17:12,<b>pond:</b> The Hebrew word (<i>mikhal</i>) is obscure.
Ii Samuel 17:13,"<b>strangled himself:</b> By hanging, in anticipation of his execution when the rebellion inevitably fails (Alter 1999)."
Ii Samuel 17:14,"<b>Mahanayim:</b> Yet another connection to the patriarch Yaakov (see Gen. 32). It is a fateful spot on Yaakov’s journey back to both his father and his brother, where he encounters angels."
Ii Samuel 17:15,<b>Yizre’elite:</b> Following Levenson/Halpern (1980) as an indication that Avshalom was seeking to restore to Amasa his father’s position. This Yizre’el was near Hevron. LXX and I Chron. 2:17 read “Yishmaelite”; MT has the puzzling “Israelite.” 
Ii Samuel 17:16,<b>come in to:</b> Here denoting marriage.
Ii Samuel 17:17,"<b>brought forward:</b> The verb actually occurs at the end of the sequence, in v.29. "
Ii Samuel 17:18,<b>beans and lentils:</b> MT’s odd repetition of “parched grain” at the end of the verse is undoubtedly a scribal error.
Ii Samuel 18:1,
Ii Samuel 18:2,
Ii Samuel 18:3,"<b>take us to heart:</b> Pay any attention to us, set their mind to us. "
Ii Samuel 18:4,<b>but <i>you:</i></b> The reading of LXX; MT has “for now” (a difference of one Hebrew letter).
Ii Samuel 18:5,"<b>Whatever is good in your eyes, I will do:</b> The David of old would not have reacted so passively. "
Ii Samuel 18:6,"<b>hundreds … thousands:</b> Ehrlich understands this as referring to military units (“companies and regiments”), not numbers per se."
Ii Samuel 18:7,<b>Go-gently:</b> McCarter (1984): “protect.” 
Ii Samuel 18:8,<b>all the people heard …:</b> To make responsibility for Avshalom’s fate absolutely clear; the command will be repeated by the anonymous soldier in v.12.
Ii Samuel 18:9,"<b>Israel:</b> I.e., Avshalom’s partisans. "
Ii Samuel 18:10,<b>the forest of Efrayim:</b> Northwest of Mahanayim on the east side of the Jordan.
Ii Samuel 18:11,"<b>more did the forest devour …:</b> An ominous note, reminiscent of folktales."
Ii Samuel 18:12,<b>mule:</b> The customary animal for royal persons to ride. Many interpreters view its loss here as symbolic of Avshalom’s loss of the throne. 
Ii Samuel 18:13,<b>oak:</b> A tree often connected to a holy place in the Bible; here it may have a connotation of judgment. 
Ii Samuel 18:14,"<b>his head:</b> We would expect “his hair” because of the earlier emphasis on that feature (see 14:26, above). But Polzin’s (13) focus on “head,” as signifying “head of state,” is well taken. "
Ii Samuel 18:15,"<b>left hanging:</b> Following versions; MT: “put, placed.” "
Ii Samuel 18:16,<b>between heaven and earth:</b> In the sense of “between the sky and the ground.”
Ii Samuel 18:17,<b>for me:</b> So ancient versions; MT has “who[ever].”
Ii Samuel 18:18,<b>like this:</b> Or “thus”; Yoav doesn’t wish to hear about the king’s command. 
Ii Samuel 18:19,"<b>rods:</b> Heb. <i>shevet</i> carries two usual meanings: the rod of parental discipline and the scepter of royalty. Both have their echoes here.
14–16 <b>thrust … sounded a thrusting-blast:</b> The Hebrew verb (<i>t-k-’</i>) is the same."
Ii Samuel 18:20,"<b>heap of stones:</b> Recalling the end of another lawbreaker, Akhan, in Josh. 7."
Ii Samuel 18:21,<b>I have no son:</b> This seems to contradict 14:27; perhaps it is an indication that no male heirs survived Avshalom. 
Ii Samuel 18:22,"<b>standing-stone:</b> Some read “heap of stones.” In any event, the contrast with the stones of the previous verse could not be more wrenching. "
Ii Samuel 18:23,<b>Avshalom’s Monument:</b> See Commentary.
Ii Samuel 18:24,"<b>wrought justice:</b> Ironic, given 15:2ff."
Ii Samuel 18:25,"<b>since:</b> The Hebrew contains the phrase <i>al ken</i>, which makes no sense. Here, as others do, I omit."
Ii Samuel 18:26,<b>Cushite:</b> An Ethiopian or Nubian.
Ii Samuel 18:27,<b>find [you favor]:</b> Following a suggestion by Alter (1999).
Ii Samuel 18:28,"<b>… Come what may:</b> It appears that a few words are missing, on the order of “He said/replied.” "
Ii Samuel 18:29,<b>the Oval:</b> The lower Jordan Valley.
Ii Samuel 18:30,"<b>between the two gateways:</b> Fokkelman (1981) takes this as a symbol of David’s ambivalence regarding Avshalom. It also recalls, as many have noted, one of the early scenes in Samuel, Eli awaiting news of the Coffer (I 4:13ff.)."
Ii Samuel 18:31,"<b>Is there peace …?:</b> Or “Is he well? Is it well with him?,” but, as the reader recalls, “peace” is part of the young man’s name. "
Ii Samuel 18:32,<b>when Yoav sent off the king’s servant …:</b> The Hebrew appears garbled here; it could be “to send off the king’s servant Yoav and your servant.” Alter (1999) suggests that it reflects emotional confusion in the messenger.
Ii Samuel 19:1,"<b>My son Avshalom, / my son, my son, Avshalom!:</b> The sound of the phrase is more memorable in Hebrew than in the usual English: Hebrew uses long vowels (<i>benEE avshaLOM / benEE benEE avshaLOM</i>), with last syllables accented, to echo the grief. "
Ii Samuel 19:2,"<b>Who will grant my dying:</b> I.e., “if only I had died.”"
Ii Samuel 19:3,"<b>the people stole away:</b> Earlier (15:6), Avshalom had “stolen away” their hearts."
Ii Samuel 19:4,<b>[if]:</b> So ancient versions; MT omits.
Ii Samuel 19:5,<b>sat:</b> McCarter (184) suggests that the action is a kind of re-enthronement.
Ii Samuel 19:6,<b>inclined the heart:</b> The last appearance of the “heart” motif in the Avshalom cycle.
Ii Samuel 19:7,<b>toenails:</b> Lit. “feet.”
Ii Samuel 19:8,<b>my servant:</b> Tziva.
Ii Samuel 19:9,<b>your servant:</b> Mefiboshet.
Ii Samuel 19:10,"<b>Why are you still speaking:</b> As Alter (1999) notes, this “still” impatiently picks up on Mefiboshet’s words in the last verse."
Ii Samuel 19:11,"<b>Kimham:</b> Pronounced <i>kim-HAHM;</i> trad. English “Chimham.” This gentleman, who has the distinction of being one of the most briefly mentioned characters in the Bible, may have been Barzillai’s son."
Ii Samuel 19:12,<b>Gilgal:</b> Site of Sha’ul’s official coronation (Alter 1999).
Ii Samuel 19:13,"<b>the men of Judah answered:</b> And the king does not, a sign of his breakdown (Fokkelman 1981)."
Ii Samuel 19:14,<b>ten shares:</b> Representing one for each of the northern tribes. 
Ii Samuel 19:15,"<b>rougher:</b> Or “more stubborn” (McCarter 1984), so they prevail."
Ii Samuel 20:1,"<b>Sheva:</b> Trad. English “Sheba.” The name echoes an earlier trouble-ridden story, that of David and Bat-Sheva (II 11–12). "
Ii Samuel 20:2,"<b>Binyaminite:</b> Like Shim’i, and, of course, Sha’ul."
Ii Samuel 20:3,"<b>tied off … living widowhood:</b> Some see this as a reminder of Avshalom’s usurpation, but it may also be another indication that David is not the man he once was."
Ii Samuel 20:4,"<b>delayed:</b> Heb. <i>va-yoher</i> echoes <i>ahar, aharei</i>, “after,” a theme word in this chapter, tied to the pursuit of the rebel Sheva. "
Ii Samuel 20:5,<b>he had appointed:</b> Referring to the king.
Ii Samuel 20:6,<b>cast-shadows over our eye:</b> Heb. difficult; it seems to imply Sheva’s escape. This translation presupposes different vowels than MT.
Ii Samuel 20:7,<b>Giv’on:</b> The rebellion narrative ends where the conflict between the houses of David and Sha’ul had its bloody beginning in II 2:13 (Exum 1996). The assassination here plays out like scenes from the <i>Godfather</i> movies.
Ii Samuel 20:8,<b>took hold … to kiss him:</b> Parallel to Avshalom’s approach to his legal supplicants in 15:5.
Ii Samuel 20:9,"<b>Yoav … David:</b> Yoav’s servant in a sense restores his master’s standing by mentioning David in the same breath, even though Yoav has technically been replaced (Alter 1999). "
Ii Samuel 20:10,<b>he said:</b> Yoav’s man.
Ii Samuel 20:11,<b>Avel of Bet-Maakha:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-VAYL bayt mah-ah-KHAH;</i> trad. English “Abel of Beth Maacah.” 
Ii Samuel 20:12,<b>Bikhrites:</b> So LXX; MT reads “Be’eirites.”
Ii Samuel 20:13,"<b>bringing-ruin:</b> Others, “battering.” Alter (1999) connects this with 14:11 above, “too much might the blood redeemer bring ruin”; similarly, he sees v.19’s “Why would you swallow Y<small>HWH</small>’s inheritance?” as echoing 14:16, “from destroying me and my son together, [away] from God’s inheritance.”"
Ii Samuel 20:14,"<b>When they inquired … :</b> That is, one received a good answer in Avel."
Ii Samuel 20:15,<b><i>I</i> [am of] those … :</b> The woman appears to be speaking for the whole town. 
Ii Samuel 20:16,"<b>a town, a mother-city:</b> Lit., “town and mother.”"
Ii Samuel 21:1,<b>the House of Bloodguilt:</b> Sha’ul’s house. 
Ii Samuel 21:2,"<b>the death of the Giv’onites:</b> Trad. English “Gibeonites.” God’s words refer to an event not previously mentioned in the Bible. Apparently Sha’ul, in contravention of the treaty between Israel and the Giv’onites recorded in Josh. 9:15, had killed some of them."
Ii Samuel 21:3,"<b>remnant of the Amorites:</b> Left over from the conquest of Canaan, again in violation of divine injunction."
Ii Samuel 21:4,"<b>impale them to Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> In open court, as it were; see v.9. "
Ii Samuel 21:5,<b>the chosen one:</b> The phrase suggests a sarcastic tone (Alter 1999).
Ii Samuel 21:6,"<b>Aya:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-YAH</i>, the name of a bird of prey, perhaps a kind of falcon, mentioned in Lev. 11:14 (and Deut. 14:13). It is appropriate to the action here (Garsiel 1991). "
Ii Samuel 21:7,<b>Merav:</b> So ancient versions; MT has “Mikhal.”
Ii Samuel 21:8,<b>the start of the barley harvest:</b> The beginning of spring.
Ii Samuel 21:9,"<b>until water poured out:</b> In the fall, when the rainy season in Israel begins."
Ii Samuel 21:10,<b>God let-himself-be-entreated:</b> And the famine ended.
Ii Samuel 21:11,<b>battles:</b> Or “war.”
Ii Samuel 21:12,"<b>and he was taken captive:</b> Following B-R. Others read, with the <i>Qere</i>, the name Yishbi here. "
Ii Samuel 21:13,"<b>Benov:</b> McCarter (1984) and others suggest that this difficult text has lost the correct name of the hero, Dodo."
Ii Samuel 21:14,"<b>Gov:</b> I Chron. 20:4 has “Gezer”; perhaps “Gov” was anticipating the next verse. In any event, its location is unknown."
Ii Samuel 21:15,"<b>weavers’:</b> Earlier in the verse, “Oregim” is a homonym (perhaps the result of a scribal error)."
Ii Samuel 21:16,"<b>toes:</b> The text uses the same word as the one for “fingers,” as is customary in biblical Hebrew."
Ii Samuel 22:1,"<b>And David spoke forth to Y<small>HWH</small> … :</b> In this chapter I have been guided by the work of Cross/Freedman, with advice from Greenstein (written communication)."
Ii Samuel 22:2,<b>horn of my deliverance:</b> See note to I 2:1. 
Ii Samuel 22:3,<b>place-of-retreat:</b> Following Goldman.
Ii Samuel 22:4,<b>Belial:</b> Another term (Heb. <i>beliyyaal</i>) for the underworld or the powers thereof.
Ii Samuel 22:5,"<b>darted:</b> Reading, as is customary, <i>va-yid’eh</i> for <i>va-yera</i>."
Ii Samuel 22:6,<b>from the brightness … coals:</b> The text is quite problematic here; perhaps “coals” has dropped down from v.9.
Ii Samuel 22:7,"<b>his voice:</b> Often in the Bible, thunder is imagined as “Y<small>HWH</small>’s voice” (see, for a powerful example, Ps. 29)."
Ii Samuel 22:8,"<b>your:</b> Missing here, but in Ps. 18:."
Ii Samuel 22:9,<b>my innocence:</b> In the legal sense.
Ii Samuel 22:10,"<b>you are devious:</b> Following McCarter’s (1984) suggestion, based again on Ps. 18."
Ii Samuel 22:11,"<b>the haughty-eyed:</b> Cross/Freedman’s reading, derived from combining this verse and Ps. 18."
Ii Samuel 22:12,<b>my God:</b> Suggested by manuscripts; MT has “Y<small>HWH</small>.”
Ii Samuel 22:13,"<b>troop:</b> JPS, on the basis of later Hebrew, reads “barrier,” paralleling “wall.”"
Ii Samuel 22:14,"<b>he makes:</b> Heb. <i>va-yittein</i>, from Ps. 18: and LXX, as opposed to MT’s <i>va-yatteir</i>."
Ii Samuel 22:15,<b>He sets my feet like [those of] deer:</b> Able to leap from hill to hill.
Ii Samuel 22:16,<b>my arms to stretch a bow:</b> Cross/Freedman emend to “together with the javelin and the bow of bronze.”
Ii Samuel 22:17,"<b>your battle-cry:</b> Heb. <i>’annotekha;</i> some emend, following 4QSam<sup>a</sup>, to <i>’ezratekha</i>, “your help.”"
Ii Samuel 22:18,<b>I batter them and shatter them:</b> Heb. <i>va-akhalleim va-emtza’eim</i>.
Ii Samuel 22:19,"<b>their necks:</b> In a classic pose of subjugation; see Gen. 49:8 for another poetic use of the image, which specifically refers to the back of the neck."
Ii Samuel 22:20,"<b>I pulverize them, I pound them:</b> Heb. <i>adikkeim erka’eim</i>."
Ii Samuel 22:21,<b>my people’s strife:</b> LXX has “strife of peoples.”
Ii Samuel 22:22,<b>hearken:</b> With the connotation of obedience.
Ii Samuel 22:23,<b>from the man of violence:</b> Cross/Freedman and others find this line strange and out of place.
Ii Samuel 22:24,"<b>who magnifies:</b> Heb. <i>magdil</i>, following the written text (<i>ketiv</i>) of MT and Ps. 18:. "
Ii Samuel 22:25,<b>for the ages!:</b> repeating the important refrain from II Sam. 7:13ff.
Ii Samuel 23:1,"<b>Utterance … :</b> The tone resembles that of Bil’am in Num. 24, using the vocabulary of prophecy. "
Ii Samuel 23:2,"<b>favored one of Israel’s Strength:</b> Understanding <i>zimra</i> (here in the plural) as in Exod. 15:2. Others, famously, “the sweet singer of Israel.”"
Ii Samuel 23:3,<b>Yashav’am the Tahkemonite:</b> The text is in difficult shape; I Chron. 11:11 reads the name as “Yashov’am son of Hakhmoni.” 
Ii Samuel 23:4,<b>the Three:</b> Some understand as “the officers.” 
Ii Samuel 23:5,<b>slain:</b> Or “wounded.”
Ii Samuel 23:6,<b>is it the blood … :</b> The Hebrew text seems to be missing a few words.

It would typically be located on a flat, hard outdoor surface, where the grain would be broken down by heavy weights such as stone rollers or even oxen. The site in the present story lay higher than David’s palace at the top of Mount Zion, and eventually became the location of Solomon’s Temple. It appears to be identical to the site of the Dome of the Rock, the Muslim monument that has stood atop the Temple Mount for more than thirteen centuries. "
Ii Samuel 24:10,"<b>Aravna:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-RAHV-nah;</i> trad.

Aravna has also been thought to have been a priest, further indicating that the Temple Mount may have been a long-standing holy site."
