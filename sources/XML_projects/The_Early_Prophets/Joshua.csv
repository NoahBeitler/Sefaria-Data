Joshua 1:1,"Now it was, after the death of Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>,
that Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua son of Nun, the attendant of Moshe, saying:"
Joshua 1:2,"Moshe my servant is dead.
So-now, arise, cross this Jordan,
you and all this people,
into the land that I am giving to them, to the Children of Israel."
Joshua 1:3,"Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread,
to you I have given it,
as I promised Moshe;"
Joshua 1:4,"from the Wilderness and this Levanon up to the Great River, the River Euphrates,
all the land of the Hittites as far as the Great Sea, toward the coming in of the sun,
shall be your territory."
Joshua 1:5,"No man will stand up before you, all the days of your life;
as I was with Moshe, I will be with you,
I will not desert you, I will not abandon you!"
Joshua 1:6,"Be strong and courageous,
for you yourself will cause this people to inherit the land
that I swore to your fathers to give them."
Joshua 1:7,"Only: be exceedingly strong and courageous
to take care to observe exactly the Instruction that Moshe my servant commanded you;
do not turn aside from it, right or left,
in order that you may prosper wherever you go."
Joshua 1:8,"This Record of the Instruction is not to depart from your mouth—
you are to recite it day and night,
in order that you may take care to observe
exactly what is written in it;
for then you will make your way prosper,
then you will excel."
Joshua 1:9,"Have I not commanded you:
be strong and courageous!?
Do not be terrified, do not be dismayed,
for with you is Y<small>HWH</small> your God, wherever you go!"
Joshua 1:10,"So Yehoshua commanded the officials of the people, saying:"
Joshua 1:11,"Cross through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying:
Prepare yourselves provisions,
for in another three days, you will be crossing this Jordan
to come to take possession of the land that Y<small>HWH</small> your God is giving you to possess."
Joshua 1:12,"Now to the Re’uvenites and to the Gadites and to the half tribe of Menashe, Yehoshua said, saying:"
Joshua 1:13,"Be mindful of the word that Moshe the servant of Y<small>HWH</small> commanded you, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> your God is granting you rest, and will give you this land;"
Joshua 1:14,"your wives, your little-ones, and your livestock will stay
in the land that Moshe gave them across the Jordan,
while you cross over, fully-armed, before your brothers,
all the mighty-men of valor,
and help them"
Joshua 1:15,"until Y<small>HWH</small> grants rest to your brothers like you,
and they too take possession of the land
that Y<small>HWH</small> your God is giving them,
and you return to the land of your possession and possess it,
which Moshe the servant of Y<small>HWH</small> gave you across the Jordan,
at the rising-place of the sun."
Joshua 1:16,"They answered Yehoshua, saying:
Everything that you have commanded us, we will do,
everywhere that you send us, we will go—"
Joshua 1:17,"just as we hearkened to Moshe, so we will hearken to you!
Only: may Y<small>HWH</small> your God be with you, as he was with Moshe!"
Joshua 1:18,"Every man who defies your orders, and does not hearken to your words exactly as you command him, shall be put to death.
Only: be strong and courageous!"
Joshua 2:1,"Yehoshua son of Nun sent twelve men, spies, from Shittim secretly, saying:
Go, look over the land, especially Jericho!
They went and they came to the house of a whore woman—her name was Rahav—
and they lay down there."
Joshua 2:2,"The king of Jericho was told, saying:
Here, some men have come here tonight from the Children of Israel to search out the land!"
Joshua 2:3,"So the king of Jericho sent to Rahav, saying:
Bring out the men who came to you, who came to your house,
for it is to search out the entire land that they have come!"
Joshua 2:4,"But the woman took the two men and concealed them;
then she said:
Certainly, the men came to me,
but I do not know where they were from."
Joshua 2:5,"And it was, as the gate was about to be closed at dark, that the men went out
—I do not know where the men went.
Pursue quickly after them,
for you may overtake them!"
Joshua 2:6,"Now she had brought them up to the roof
and had hidden them in the stalks of flax, the ones arranged by her on the roof."
Joshua 2:7,"Now the men pursued after them by way of the Jordan at the river-crossings,
and they closed the gate, after the pursuers had gone out after them."
Joshua 2:8,"As for them, scarcely had they lay down when <i>she</i> came up to them on the roof."
Joshua 2:9,"She said to the men:
I know
that Y<small>HWH</small> has given you the land,
and that the dread of you has fallen upon us;
all the settled-folk of the land are quivering before you!"
Joshua 2:10,"For we heard about [how] Y<small>HWH</small> dried up the waters of the Sea of Reeds before you when you went out of Egypt,
and what you did to the two Amorite kings who were across the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og,
whom you devoted-to-destruction."
Joshua 2:11,"We heard, and our hearts melted [in fear],
and no life-breath rose within anyone because of you,
for Y<small>HWH</small> your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath!"
Joshua 2:12,"So-now, pray swear to me by Y<small>HWH</small>, that since I have acted toward you with loyalty,
you also will act toward my Father’s House with loyalty
and will give me a trustworthy sign;"
Joshua 2:13,"you will keep alive my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters, and all those belonging to them,
and save our lives from death!"
Joshua 2:14,"The men said to her:
Our life [shall be] in place of yours, to die, as long as you do not tell this business of ours!
And it will be, at Y<small>HWH</small>’s giving the land to us,
that we will act toward you in loyalty and faithfulness."
Joshua 2:15,"Then she let them down by a rope through the window
—for her house was on the outer-part of the wall, and in the wall she dwelt—"
Joshua 2:16,"and she said to them:
To the highlands go, lest the pursuers encounter you,
and hide yourselves there for three days, until the pursuers’ return;
afterward you may go on your way."
Joshua 2:17,"The men said to her:
We are clear of this your sworn-oath which you have had us swear:"
Joshua 2:18,"here, when we come to the land,
this cord of scarlet thread you are to tie in the window through which you let us down,
while your father and your mother and your brothers and all your Father’s Household you are to gather to yourself into the house;"
Joshua 2:19,"and it shall be: whoever goes out of the doors of your house, outside,
his blood will be on his head,
and we will be clear,
while whoever will be with you in the house,
his blood will be on our head, if [any] hand be against him!"
Joshua 2:20,"Now if you tell this business of ours, we will be clear from your sworn-oath that you have had us swear."
Joshua 2:21,"She said:
In accordance with your words, so be it!
So she sent them off, and they went,
and she tied the scarlet cord through the window."
Joshua 2:22,"They went off and came to the highlands, and stayed there for three days,
until the pursuers returned;
the pursuers sought them all along the way, but did not find [them]."
Joshua 2:23,"The two men came down again from the highlands;
they crossed over and came to Yehoshua son of Nun, and recounted to him all that had befallen them:"
Joshua 2:24,"they said to Yehoshua:
Indeed, Y<small>HWH</small> has given the entire land into our hand,
and also all the settled-folk of the land are quivering before us!"
Joshua 3:1,"Yehoshua started-early in the morning;
they marched on from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the Children of Israel,
and they spent the night there, before they crossed over."
Joshua 3:2,"Now it was at the end of three days
that the officials crossed into the midst of the camp"
Joshua 3:3,"and commanded the people, saying:
When you see the Coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> your God
with the priests and the Levites carrying it,
you yourselves are to march on from your place
and walk behind it."
Joshua 3:4,"However—let it be far between you and it, about two thousand cubits in measure;
do not come near it,
in order that you may know the way that you are to go,
for you have not crossed that way yesterday [or] the day-before."
Joshua 3:5,"Yehoshua said to the people:
Make yourselves holy,
for tomorrow Y<small>HWH</small> will perform wonders in your midst!"
Joshua 3:6,"And Yehoshua said to the priests, saying:
Carry the Coffer of the Covenant
and cross over before the people!
So they carried the Coffer of the Covenant
and walked before the people."
Joshua 3:7,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Today I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel,
that they may know
that as I was with Moshe, I will be with you!"
Joshua 3:8,"And you, command the priests, those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant, saying:
When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan,
in the Jordan you are to stand-still."
Joshua 3:9,"Yehoshua said to the Children of Israel:
Approach here and hearken to the words of Y<small>HWH</small> your God."
Joshua 3:10,"Then Yehoshua said:
By this you shall know
that the Living God is in your midst,
and that he will dispossess, yes, dispossess from before you
the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivvite,
the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Yevusite:"
Joshua 3:11,"here is the Coffer of the Covenant;
the Lord of All the Earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan!"
Joshua 3:12,"So-now, take yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel,
one man, one man [apiece] per tribe."
Joshua 3:13,"It will be, when the soles of the feet of the priests, those
carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>, the Lord of All the Earth, come to rest in the waters of the Jordan,
the waters of the Jordan will be cut off;
as for the waters coming down from above—
they will stand as one heap!"
Joshua 3:14,"So it was, at the people’s marching from their tents to cross the Jordan,
with the priests, those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant, before the people:"
Joshua 3:15,"that when those carrying the Coffer came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests, those carrying the Coffer, dipped in the edge of the water
—the Jordan being full to its banks, all the days of the harvest-cutting—"
Joshua 3:16,"the waters stood still, those coming down from above;
they rose as one heap, very far away, at Adam, the town that is beside Tzaretan,
while those going down to the Sea of the Plain, the Sea of Salt, were completely cut off,
and the people crossed over, opposite Jericho."
Joshua 3:17,"And the priests, those carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant, stood fast on dry-ground, in the middle of the Jordan,
while all Israel crossed over onto dry-ground,
until the entire nation had completed crossing over the Jordan."
Joshua 4:1,"Now it was, when the entire nation had completely crossed over the Jordan,
that Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua, saying:"
Joshua 4:2,"Take yourselves from the people twelve men: one man, one man [apiece] per tribe,"
Joshua 4:3,"and command them, saying:
Lift you up from here, from the middle of the Jordan, from the firmstanding-spot of the priests’ feet,
twelve stones;
have them cross over with you
and place them at the night-lodging where you will lodge tonight."
Joshua 4:4,"So Yehoshua called for twelve men whom he had confirmed, from the Children of Israel,
one man, one man [apiece] per tribe,"
Joshua 4:5,"and Yehoshua said to them:
Cross over before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> your God, into the middle of the Jordan,
and raise yourselves, each one, a stone onto his shoulder,
corresponding to the number of tribes of the Children of Israel,"
Joshua 4:6,"in order that this may be a sign in your midst:
when your children ask you on the morrow, saying:
What are these stones to you?"
Joshua 4:7,"you are to say to them
that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small>;
when it crossed into the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.
And these stones are to be a reminder to the Children of Israel, into the ages!"
Joshua 4:8,"The Children of Israel did thus, as Yehoshua had commanded:
they lifted up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken to Yehoshua,
corresponding to the number of tribes of the Children of Israel,
and had them cross over with them to the lodging-place, and deposited them there."
Joshua 4:9,"And the twelve stones Yehoshua erected in the middle of the Jordan, beneath the firmstanding-spot of the priests’ feet, those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant;
they are there until this day."
Joshua 4:10,"Now the priests, those carrying the Coffer, were standing fast in the middle of the Jordan,
until all the matter that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Yehoshua to speak to the people was completed,
exactly as Moshe had commanded Yehoshua;
the people went quickly, and they crossed over."
Joshua 4:11,"And it was, when all the people had completed crossing over,
that the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> and the priests crossed over before the people."
Joshua 4:12,"And the Children of Re’uven, the Children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menashe crossed over, armed, before the Children of Israel,
as Moshe had spoken to them;"
Joshua 4:13,"about forty units of specially-drafted [men] from the armed-forces crossed over in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> to battle,
to the Plains of Jericho."
Joshua 4:14,"On that day Y<small>HWH</small> made Yehoshua great in the eyes of all Israel;
they held him in awe, just as they had held Moshe in awe,
all the days of his life."
Joshua 4:15,"Then Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua, saying:"
Joshua 4:16,"Command the priests, those carrying the Coffer of the Testimony,
that they should come up from the Jordan."
Joshua 4:17,"So Yehoshua commanded the priests, saying:
Come up from the Jordan!"
Joshua 4:18,"And it was, upon the coming up of the priests, those carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant, from the middle of the Jordan,
—the soles of the priests’ feet were drawn up onto the dry-ground—
that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place
and went on as yesterday [and] the day-before, to all their banks."
Joshua 4:19,"Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month,
and encamped at Gilgal/Circle, at the sunrise edge of Jericho."
Joshua 4:20,"And these twelve stones that they had taken from the Jordan, Yehoshua erected at Gilgal."
Joshua 4:21,"He said to the Children of Israel, saying:
When your children ask their fathers on the morrow, saying:
What are these stones?"
Joshua 4:22,"You are to make known to your children, saying:
On dry-land did Israel cross this Jordan,"
Joshua 4:23,"when Y<small>HWH</small> your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until your crossing over,
just as Y<small>HWH</small> your God had done at the Sea of Reeds, which he dried up before us, until our crossing over—"
Joshua 4:24,"in order that all the peoples of the earth might have knowledge of the hand of Y<small>HWH</small>, how strong it is,
in order that you might hold Y<small>HWH</small> your God in awe, all the days [to come],"
Joshua 5:1,"Now it was, when they heard—all the Amorite kings who were across the Jordan seaward,
and all the Canaanite kings who were by the Sea,
that Y<small>HWH</small> had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Children of Israel, until they had crossed over,
their heart melted [in fear],
and they were left breathless before the Children of Israel."
Joshua 5:2,"At that time, Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Make yourself knives of flint
and again circumcise the Children of Israel, a second time."
Joshua 5:3,"So Yehoshua made himself knives of flint
and circumcised the Children of Israel, at the Hill of Foreskins."
Joshua 5:4,"And this is the matter concerning which Yehoshua circumcised them:
all the people coming out of Egypt, the males, all the men of battle,
had died in the wilderness, on the way,
upon their going out of Egypt."
Joshua 5:5,"For they had been circumcised, all the people who had gone out,
while all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way, upon their going out of Egypt, had not been circumcised."
Joshua 5:6,"For the Children of Israel had traveled forty years in the wilderness,
until the entire nation was gone, the men of battle, who had come out of Egypt,
who had not hearkened to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>,
those to whom Y<small>HWH</small> swore that he would not let them see the land
that Y<small>HWH</small> had sworn to their fathers to give them,
a land flowing with milk and honey."
Joshua 5:7,"But their children whom he had raised up in their place,
<i>them</i> Yehoshua circumcised, for they were foreskinned,
since they had not been circumcised on the way."
Joshua 5:8,"Now it was, when the entire nation was done being circumcised,
that they stayed in their place in the camp, until their recovery."
Joshua 5:9,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Today I have rolled the disgrace of Egypt from off you!
So the name of that place has been called Gilgal/Rolling, until this day."
Joshua 5:10,"The Children of Israel encamped at Gilgal,
and they performed the Passover offering on the fourteenth day of the month, at sunset,
in the Plains of Jericho."
Joshua 5:11,"They ate from the yield of the land on the morrow of Passover: unleavened cakes and parched grain,
on this very day."
Joshua 5:12,"And the <i>mahn</i> ceased on the morrow, when they ate the yield of the land;
there was no more <i>mahn</i> for the Children of Israel,
and they ate from the produce of the land of Canaan in that year."
Joshua 5:13,"Now it was, when Yehoshua was at Jericho,
that he lifted up his eyes and saw:
now here, a man standing opposite him,
with his sword drawn in his hand!
Yehoshua went toward him and said to him:
Are you for us or for our foes?"
Joshua 5:14,"He said: No,
rather, I am the commander of Y<small>HWH</small>’s forces.
Now I have come!
Yehoshua flung himself on his face to the ground and bowed low,
and said to him:
What does my lord have to speak to his servant?"
Joshua 5:15,"The commander of Y<small>HWH</small>’s forces said to Yehoshua:
Put off your sandal from your foot,
for the place on which you are standing—it is holy!
And Yehoshua did thus."
Joshua 6:1,"Now Jericho closed up and was closed-up-tight before the Children of Israel;
no one went out and no one came in."
Joshua 6:2,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
See, I have given into your hand
Jericho and her king, [and] the mighty-men of valor."
Joshua 6:3,"You are to go around the city, all the men of battle,
circling the city one time;
thus you are to do for six days,"
Joshua 6:4,"while seven priests are to carry seven <i>shofars</i> of rams ahead of the Coffer.
But on the seventh day, you are to go around the city seven times,
while the priests sound blasts on the <i>shofars</i>."
Joshua 6:5,"And it shall be, at the drawing out of the ram’s horn:
when you hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i>,
that all the fighting-people are to shout a great shout,
and the wall of the city will fall down from below;
then the fighting-people are to go up, each one [straight] in front of him!"
Joshua 6:6,"Yehoshua son of Nun called for the priests
and said to them:
Carry the Coffer of the Covenant,
while seven priests carry seven <i>shofars</i> of rams ahead of the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Joshua 6:7,"And he said to the fighting-people:
Cross over and go around the city;
as for the vanguard, it shall cross over ahead of the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Joshua 6:8,"And it was, as soon as Yehoshua talked to the fighting-people,
with the seven priests carrying the seven <i>shofars of</i> rams in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
that they crossed over
and sounded blasts on the <i>shofars</i>,
with the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant going after them."
Joshua 6:9,"Now the vanguard was going ahead of the priests, those sounding blasts [on] the <i>shofars</i>,
while the gathering-up [unit] was going after the Coffer, going and sounding blasts on the <i>shofars</i>."
Joshua 6:10,"As for the fighting-people, Yehoshua commanded them, saying:
You are not to shout, you are not to make your voice heard,
not a word is to go out of your mouth
until the time of my saying to you: Shout!
Then you are to shout."
Joshua 6:11,"He had the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> go around the city,
circling one time;
then they came back to the camp
and spent the night in the camp."
Joshua 6:12,"Yehoshua started early in the morning,
and the priests carried up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Joshua 6:13,"while the seven priests carrying the seven <i>shofars</i> of rams ahead of the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>
were going, going along and sounding blasts on the <i>shofars</i>,
with the vanguard going ahead of them
and with the gathering-up [unit] going ahead of the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>,
going along and sounding blasts on the <i>shofars</i>."
Joshua 6:14,"They went around the city on the second day, one time,
and then they returned to the camp.
Thus they did for six days."
Joshua 6:15,"Now it was, on the seventh day,
that they started early, at the coming up of dawn;
they went around the city in this manner seven times—
only on this day did they go around the city seven times."
Joshua 6:16,"And it was, at the seventh time,
that the priests sounded blasts on the <i>shofars</i>,
and Yehoshua said to the fighting-people:
Shout!
For Y<small>HWH</small> has given you the city!"
Joshua 6:17,"The city will be devoted-to-destruction,
it and all who are in it, for Y<small>HWH</small>;
only Rahav the whore shall live,
she and all who are with her in the house,
for she hid the messengers whom we sent."
Joshua 6:18,"And you, only be careful regarding the devoted-things,
lest you feel desire and take from the devoted-things
and render the camp of Israel devoted-to-destruction,
and bring disaster upon it."
Joshua 6:19,"For all silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron—
they are holy to Y<small>HWH</small>;
into the treasury of Y<small>HWH</small> they are to come!"
Joshua 6:20,"So the fighting-people shouted and sounded blasts on the <i>shofars;</i>
and it was, at the people’s hearing the <i>shofar</i> sound,
that the people shouted a great shout,
and the wall fell down from below,
and the people went up to the city, each one [straight] in front of him,
and captured the city."
Joshua 6:21,"And they devoted-to-destruction everyone who was in the city,
from man to woman, from young lad to old man,
to ox and sheep and donkey,
with the mouth of the sword."
Joshua 6:22,"But to the two men, those spying out the land, Yehoshua said:
Go to the house of the whore woman
and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her,
as you swore to her."
Joshua 6:23,"So the lads, the spies, went
and brought out Rahav and her father and her mother and her brothers and all who belonged to her
—all her clan they brought out—
and they placed them outside the camp of Israel."
Joshua 6:24,"As for the city, they burned it with fire, along with everything that was in it;
only the silver and the gold and the vessels of bronze and iron did they place in the treasury of the house of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Joshua 6:25,"As for Rahav the whore, and her Father’s House, and all who belonged to her, Yehoshua let [them] live;
she settled in the midst of Israel, until this day,
for she had hid the messengers whom Yehoshua had sent to spy out Jericho."
Joshua 6:26,"And Yehoshua had [an oath] sworn at that time, saying:
Doomed be the man before Y<small>HWH</small>
who arises and rebuilds this city, Jericho:
with his firstborn he will found it,
and with his youngest he will set up its doors!"
Joshua 6:27,"And Y<small>HWH</small> was with Yehoshua,
and report of him went throughout all the land."
Joshua 7:1,"But the Children of Israel committed sacrilege, yes, sacrilege regarding the devoted-things:
Akhan son of Carmi son of Zavdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took from the devoted-things,
and the anger of Y<small>HWH</small> flared up against the Children of Israel."
Joshua 7:2,"Meanwhile, Yehoshua sent men from Jericho to Ai/The Ruin, which is beside Bet-Aven, east of Bet-El,
and said to them, saying:
Go up and spy out the land.
So the men went up and spied out Ai;"
Joshua 7:3,"then they returned to Yehoshua and said to him:
Not all the fighting-people need go up.
Let about two thousand men or three thousand men go up and strike Ai—
do not exhaust all the fighting-people there, for they are few."
Joshua 7:4,"So there went up there, from the fighting-people, about three thousand men,
but they fled from before the men of Ai:"
Joshua 7:5,"the men of Ai struck down of them about thirty-six men
and pursued them in front of the gate, to the Broken-Places;
they struck them at the descent,
and the heart of the fighting-people melted [in fear] and turned to water."
Joshua 7:6,"Yehoshua tore his clothes
and flung himself on his face on the ground before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>, until sunset, he and the elders of Israel,
and they tossed earth on their heads."
Joshua 7:7,"Yehoshua said:
Alas, Y<small>HWH</small> God,
why did you bring this people across, yes, across the Jordan,
to give us into the hand of the Amorite, to have us perish?
Would that we had resolved that we should stay across the Jordan!"
Joshua 7:8,"Please, O my Lord,
what can I say after Israel has turned the back-of-its-neck to its enemies?"
Joshua 7:9,"When the Cannanites hear, along with all the settled-folk of the land,
they will reverse course against us and cut off our name from the earth—
then what will you do about your great name?"
Joshua 7:10,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Arise;
now why are you fallen on your face?"
Joshua 7:11,"Israel has sinned:
yes, they have crossed my covenant that I commanded them,
yes, they have taken from the devoted-things,
yes, they have stolen,
yes, they have lied,
yes, they have put it among their vessels!"
Joshua 7:12,"So the Children of Israel will not be able to rise before their enemies;
the back-of-the-neck they will turn to their enemies,
for they have become liable-to-destruction—
I will not continue to be with you
if you do not wipe out the devoted-things from your midst!"
Joshua 7:13,"Arise, hallow the people—
you are to say:
Hallow yourselves for tomorrow,
for thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Devoted-things are in your midst, O Israel;
you will not be able to stand before your enemies
until your removing the devoted-things from your midst!"
Joshua 7:14,"You are to come near in the morning by your tribes,
and it shall be: the tribe that Y<small>HWH</small> captures-by-lot
shall come near by clans;
and the clan that Y<small>HWH</small> captures
shall come near by houses;
and the house that Y<small>HWH</small> captures
shall come near by the males."
Joshua 7:15,"And it shall be: the one captured-by-lot regarding the devoted-things is to be burned with fire,
he and all who belong to him,
because he crossed the covenant of Y<small>HWH</small>,
because he did a vile-thing in Israel!"
Joshua 7:16,"So Yehoshua started early in the morning;
he brought Israel near, by their tribes,
and the tribe of Judah was captured-by-lot."
Joshua 7:17,"He brought near the clans of Judah,
and the Zarhite clan was captured;
he brought near the Zarhite clans, by the males, and Zavdi was captured;"
Joshua 7:18,"he brought near his house, by the males,
and Akhan son of Carmi son of Zavdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was captured."
Joshua 7:19,"Yehoshua said to Akhan:
My son, now give glory to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
and make confession to him;
now tell me: What have you done?
Do not conceal it from me!"
Joshua 7:20,"Akhan answered Yehoshua and said:
In truth, I did sin against Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel;
like this and like that I did:"
Joshua 7:21,"I saw among the spoils a goodly Shin’ar mantle, and two hundred weights of silver,
and an ingot of gold, fifty weights its weight;
I desired them and I took them—
and here they are, hidden in the ground, within my tent, along with the silver beneath it."
Joshua 7:22,"Yehoshua sent messengers;
they ran to the tent,
and here, [it was] hidden in his tent, with the silver beneath it!"
Joshua 7:23,"They took them from amid the tent and brought them to Yehoshua and to all the Children of Israel,
and they emptied them out in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Joshua 7:24,"Then Yehoshua took Akhan son of Zerah
and the silver, and the mantle, and the ingot of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his ox, and his donkey, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that belonged to him,
—all Israel was with him—
and they brought them up to the Valley of Akhor/Disaster."
Joshua 7:25,"Yehoshua said:
How you have brought-disaster-on us!
Y<small>HWH</small> will bring-disaster-on you this day!
And all Israel pelted him with stones;
they burned them with fire
and stone-heaped them with stones,"
Joshua 7:26,"and erected over him a large mound of stones, until this day.
So Y<small>HWH</small> turned back from his flaming anger.
Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Disaster, until this day."
Joshua 8:1,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Do not be frightened, do not be dismayed;
take all the people of battle with you
and arise, go up to Ai.
See: I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land!"
Joshua 8:2,"You are to do to Ai and to its king
as you did to Jericho and to its king;
only its spoils and its animals may you plunder for yourselves.
Set yourself an ambush for the city, behind it."
Joshua 8:3,"So Yehoshua arose, along with all the people of battle, to go up against Ai.
And Yehoshua chose thirty thousand men, mighty-men of valor,
and sent them off at night;"
Joshua 8:4,"he charged them, saying:
See: you are setting an ambush for the city, behind the city;
do not go exceedingly far from the city,
but all of you be ready."
Joshua 8:5,"As for me and all the fighting-people who are with me,
we will come near to the city,
and it shall be:
when they come out to meet us, as at the beginning,
we will flee before them."
Joshua 8:6,"But when they come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city,
—for they will think: They are fleeing before us as at the beginning!
and we flee before them—"
Joshua 8:7,"then <i>you</i> are to arise from the ambush
and take possession of the city;
Y<small>HWH</small> your God will give it into your hand!"
Joshua 8:8,"And it will be, when you seize the city,
that you are to ignite the city with fire;
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> you are to do.
See: I have charged you!"
Joshua 8:9,"Yehoshua sent them off, and they went to the [place of] ambush
and stayed between Bet-El and Ai, seaward from Ai,
and Yehoshua spent the night on that night amid the fighting-people."
Joshua 8:10,"Yehoshua started early in the morning and mustered the fighting-people;
then he went up, he and the elders of Israel, ahead of the fighting-people to Ai,"
Joshua 8:11,"while all the people for battle who were with him went up and approached, coming opposite the city,
and encamped north of Ai,
with a ravine between them and Ai."
Joshua 8:12,"He took about five thousand men
and set them in ambush between Bet-El and Ai, seaward of the city,"
Joshua 8:13,"while the fighting-people set up the entire camp that was north of the city,
as well as its rearguard, seaward of the city.
And Yehoshua lodged that night in the middle of the valley."
Joshua 8:14,"Now it was, when the king of Ai saw,
that they went quickly and started-early, and the men of the city came out to meet Israel in battle,
he and all his fighting-people, to the appointed place in front of the plain
—but he did not know that there was an ambush for him behind the city."
Joshua 8:15,"And Yehoshua and all the fighting-people acted as if beaten before them;
they fled by way of the wilderness."
Joshua 8:16,"Then all the fighting-people who were in the city were summoned to pursue after them,
and they pursued after Yehoshua and let themselves be torn away from the city,"
Joshua 8:17,"so that not a man remained in Ai or in Bet-El who had not gone out after Israel;
they left the city open
and pursued after Israel."
Joshua 8:18,"Then Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Stretch out the scimitar that is in your hand toward Ai,
for into your hand I give it!
So Yehoshua stretched out the scimitar that was in his hand toward the city,"
Joshua 8:19,"and the ambush quickly arose from its place
and ran, at the stretching out of his hand;
they came to the city and captured it,
and quickly ignited the city with fire."
Joshua 8:20,"The men of Ai faced about behind them and saw:
now here, the smoke of the city went up to the heavens!
But they had no [place] at hand to flee to here or to there.
And the fighting-people who had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers."
Joshua 8:21,"Now Yehoshua and all Israel saw
that the ambush had taken the city,
and that the smoke of the city was going up,
so they returned and struck down the men of Ai."
Joshua 8:22,"These went out of the city to meet them,
and they were, regarding Israel, in the middle: these were on this-side and those were on that-side,
and they struck them down
until they left them no survivor or fugitive."
Joshua 8:23,"As for the king of Ai, they seized [him] alive
and brought him near to Yehoshua."
Joshua 8:24,"Now it was, when Israel had finished killing all of the settled-folk of Ai, in the open-field and in the wilderness where they had pursued them,
—all of them fell by the mouth of the sword, until they were gone—
that all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the mouth of the sword."
Joshua 8:25,"And all those falling on that day, from man to woman,
were twelve thousand, all the inhabitants of Ai."
Joshua 8:26,"Now Yehoshua did not turn back his hand with which he had stretched out the scimitar
until he had devoted-to-destruction all the settled-folk of Ai."
Joshua 8:27,"Only the animals and the spoils of that city did Israel plunder for themselves,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had commanded Yehoshua."
Joshua 8:28,"And Yehoshua burned down Ai;
he made it into an everlasting mound, a wasteland, until this day."
Joshua 8:29,"As for the king of Ai, he hung him on a wooden-stake, until the time of sunset,
and when the sun came in, Yehoshua commanded that they take his corpse down from the stake,
and they threw it by the entrance to the city gate
and erected over it a large mound of stones, until this day."
Joshua 8:30,"Then Yehoshua built a sacrificial-altar to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, on Mount Eval,"
Joshua 8:31,"as Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had commanded the Children of Israel,
as is written in the Record of the Instruction of Moshe,
an altar of complete stones, upon which no iron had been raised,
and they sent up upon it offerings-up to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and sacrificed <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
Joshua 8:32,"And he wrote there upon the stones
a copy of the Instruction of Moshe,
which he had written before the Children of Israel."
Joshua 8:33,"Now all Israel and its elders and its officials and its judges were standing on this-side and on that-side,
by the Coffer, opposite the Levitical priests, those carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant:
as the sojourner, so the citizen,
half of them opposite Mount Gerizim and half of them opposite Mount Eval,
as Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had commanded [them] to bless the people of Israel at the beginning."
Joshua 8:34,"After that, he read aloud all the words of the Instruction, the blessing and the curse,
exactly as was written in the Record of the Instruction."
Joshua 8:35,"There was not a word from all that Moshe had commanded
that Yehoshua did not read aloud opposite the entire assembly of Israel,
and the women, and the little-ones, and the sojourner who was going in their midst."
Joshua 9:1,"Now it was, when all the kings who were across the Jordan heard
—in the highlands and in the lowlands, and on all the shore of the Great Sea, opposite the Levanon,
the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivvites, and the Yevusites—,"
Joshua 9:2,"that they gathered together to do battle with Yehoshua and with Israel, [under] one command."
Joshua 9:3,"But the settled-folk of Giv’on heard about what Yehoshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,"
Joshua 9:4,"so they acted, for their part, with cunning, and went and supplied themselves:
they took worn-out sacks on their donkeys,
and worn-out wineskins, split and sewn up,"
Joshua 9:5,"with worn-out and patched sandals on their feet,
and worn-out clothes upon themselves,
while all the bread of their supplies was dry [and] had become crumbs."
Joshua 9:6,"And they went to Yehoshua, to the camp at Gilgal,
and said to him and to the men of Israel:
From a far-off land we have come;
so-now, cut a covenant with us!"
Joshua 9:7,"The men of Israel said to the Hivvites:
Perhaps you are settled in my midst,
so how can I cut a covenant with you?"
Joshua 9:8,"They said to Yehoshua:
We are your servants!
Yehoshua said to them:
Who are you, and from where have you come?"
Joshua 9:9,"They said to him:
From a land exceedingly far off your servants have come,
because of the fame of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
for we have heard the heard-report of him
and of all that he did in Egypt,"
Joshua 9:10,"and of all that he did to the two Amorite kings who were across the Jordan,
to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtarot."
Joshua 9:11,"So our elders and all the settled-folk of our land said to us, saying:
Take in your hand supplies for the way,
and go meet them
and say to them:
We are your servants.
So-now, cut a covenant with us!"
Joshua 9:12,"This our bread—[while it was] warm, we supplied ourselves with it, from our houses,
on the day of our setting out to go to you,
but now, here, it is dry [and] has become crumbs!"
Joshua 9:13,"And these wineskins that we filled new:
here, they have split open;
and these our clothes and our sandals have worn out
from this very great journey"
Joshua 9:14,"The men took from their supplies, but did not inquire of Y<small>HWH</small>’s mouth."
Joshua 9:15,"And Yehoshua made peace with them:
he cut a covenant with them, letting them live,
and the exalted-leaders of the community swore [an oath] to them."
Joshua 9:16,"But it was, at the end of three days after they had cut a covenant with them,
that they heard that they [dwelt] near to them,
and that it was in their midst that they were settled!"
Joshua 9:17,"So the Children of Israel marched out and came to their towns on the third day
—now their towns were Giv’on and Kefira and Be’erot and Kiryat-Ye’arim."
Joshua 9:18,"But the Children of Israel did not strike them down, since the leaders of the community had sworn to them by Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
so the entire community grumbled against the leaders."
Joshua 9:19,"And all the leaders said to the entire community:
We ourselves swore to them by Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
so now we are not able to harm them!"
Joshua 9:20,"This [is how] we must act toward them:
let them live,
that there not be fury against us regarding the sworn-oath that we swore to them!"
Joshua 9:21,"And the leaders said to them:
They may live.
So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the entire community,
as the leaders had spoken concerning them."
Joshua 9:22,"But Yehoshua called for them and spoke to them, saying:
Why did you deceive us, saying:
We are exceedingly far from you,
when you are settled in our midst?"
Joshua 9:23,"So-now, doomed are you:
never shall a servant be cut off from you
either as hewers of wood or drawers of water for the house of my God!"
Joshua 9:24,"They answered Yehoshua and said:
It was because it was told, yes, told to your servants
that Y<small>HWH</small> your God had commanded Moshe his servant
to give you all the land
and to wipe out all the settled-folk of the land before you—
so we were very afraid for our lives before you,
and we did this thing."
Joshua 9:25,"But now, here we are in your hand;
as is good, as is right in your eyes to do with us, do."
Joshua 9:26,"So he did thus with them:
he rescued them from the hand of the Children of Israel, so that they did not kill them,"
Joshua 9:27,"but Yehoshua made them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the community,
and for the sacrificial-altar of Y<small>HWH</small>, until this day,
at the place that he chooses."
Joshua 10:1,"Now it was, when Adoni-Tzedek, king of Jerusalem, heard
that Yehoshua had captured Ai, and had devoted-it-to-destruction,
—as he had done to Jericho and to its king, so he had done to Ai and to its king—
and that the settled-folk of Giv’on had made peace with Israel
and were remaining in their midst,"
Joshua 10:2,"he was exceedingly afraid,
for Giv’on was a large city, like one of the royal cities
—indeed, it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty ones."
Joshua 10:3,"So Adoni-Tzedek king of Jerusalem sent [word]
to Hoham king of Hevron, and to Pir’am king of Yarmut, and to Yafia king of Lakhish, and to Devir king of Eglon, saying:"
Joshua 10:4,"Come up to me and help me,
that we may strike Giv’on,
for they have made peace with Yehoshua and with the Children of Israel!"
Joshua 10:5,"They gathered together and went up, the five Amorite kings—
the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hevron, the king of Yarmut, the king of Lakhish, and the king of Eglon,
they and all their camps,
and they encamped against Giv’on, and did battle with it."
Joshua 10:6,"The men of Giv’on sent [word] to Yehoshua, to the camp at Gilgal, saying:
Do not let your hand slacken from your servants;
come up to us quickly
and deliver us, help us,
for all the kings of the Amorites, the settled-folk of the highlands, have gathered against us!"
Joshua 10:7,"So Yehoshua went up from Gilgal,
he and all the people of battle with him,
and all the mighty-men of valor."
Joshua 10:8,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Do not be afraid of them,
for into your hand I have given them;
no man among them will be able to stand up before you!"
Joshua 10:9,"Yehoshua came against them, suddenly,
having gone up all night from Gilgal."
Joshua 10:10,"And Y<small>HWH</small> panicked them before Israel,
so that they struck them, a great striking-down, at Giv’on,
and pursued them by way of the Bet-Horon Pass;
they struck at them as far as Azeka and as far as Makkeda."
Joshua 10:11,"Now it was, when they were fleeing before Israel,
—they were at the descent of Bet-Horon—
that Y<small>HWH</small> threw down upon them large stones from the heavens, as far as Azeka, and they died;
[there were] more who died by the stones
than those whom the Children of Israel killed with the sword."
Joshua 10:12,"Then Yehoshua spoke to Y<small>HWH</small>
on the day of Y<small>HWH</small>’s giving the Amorites before the Children of Israel;
he said before the eyes of Israel:
O sun, at Giv’on be still,
O moon, in the Valley of Ayyalon!"
Joshua 10:13,"So the sun was still, and the moon stood fast,
until a nation was avenged on its enemies.
—Is it not written in the Record of the Upright:
The sun stood fast in the midst of the heavens;
it did not hasten to come in as on a whole day?"
Joshua 10:14,"There has been none like that day before it or after it,
for Y<small>HWH</small> to hearken to a man’s voice,
since Y<small>HWH</small> was fighting for Israel."
Joshua 10:15,Then Yehoshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua 10:16,"And these five kings fled
and hid themselves in a cave at Makkeda."
Joshua 10:17,"And Yehoshua was told, saying:
The five kings have been found hiding in a cave at Makkeda!"
Joshua 10:18,"Yehoshua said:
Roll large stones over the mouth of the cave,
and assign men over it to watch them."
Joshua 10:19,"As for you, do not stand around—
pursue after your enemies, attack-their-tail;
do not allow them to come back to their cities,
for Y<small>HWH</small> your God has given them into your hand!"
Joshua 10:20,"So it was, when Yehoshua and the Children of Israel had finished striking them, a very great striking-down, until they were gone,
while the survivors had escaped from them and had come back to the fortified towns—"
Joshua 10:21,"that all the fighting-people returned to the camp, to Yehoshua at Makkeda, safely;
not a man wagged his tongue against the Children of Israel."
Joshua 10:22,"And Yehoshua said:
Open the mouth of the cave
and bring out these five kings to me from the cave!"
Joshua 10:23,"They did thus:
they brought out these five kings to him from the cave,
the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hevron, the king of Yarmut, the king of Lakhish, the king of Eglon;"
Joshua 10:24,"and it was, upon their bringing out the kings to Yehoshua,
that Yehoshua called for all the fighting-men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of battle who had gone with him:
Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings!
So they came near and put their feet on their necks."
Joshua 10:25,"Yehoshua said to them:
Do not be frightened, do not be dismayed;
be strong and courageous,
for thus will Y<small>HWH</small> do to all your enemies with whom you do battle!"
Joshua 10:26,"And Yehoshua struck them down after that, and put them to death;
he hung them on five stakes,
and they were hung on the stakes until sunset."
Joshua 10:27,"Now it was, at the time of the sun coming in,
that Yehoshua commanded [them] and they took them down from the stakes,
and they threw them into the cave where they had hidden.
Then they put large stones over the mouth of the cave,
[there] until this very day."
Joshua 10:28,"As for Makkeda, Yehoshua captured [it] on that day;
he struck it with the mouth of the sword, along with its king,
and he devoted-it-to-destruction, along with every person that was in it—
he left no survivor.
And he did to the king of Makkeda as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua 10:29,"Yehoshua and all Israel with him crossed over from Makkeda to Livna
and did battle with Livna."
Joshua 10:30,"And Y<small>HWH</small> gave it too into the hand of Israel, along with its king;
he struck it with the mouth of the sword,
along with every person that was in it—
he left in it no survivor.
And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua 10:31,"Yehoshua and all Israel crossed over from Livna to Lakhish;
they encamped against it and did battle against it."
Joshua 10:32,"And Y<small>HWH</small> gave Lakhish into the hand of Israel,
so that he captured it on the second day;
he struck it with the mouth of the sword,
along with every person who was in it,
exactly as he had done to Livna."
Joshua 10:33,"Then Horam king of Gezer went up to help Lakhish,
but Yehoshua and his fighting-people struck him,
until he left him no survivor."
Joshua 10:34,"Yehoshua and all Israel with him crossed over from Lakhish to Eglon;
they encamped against it and did battle with it"
Joshua 10:35,"and captured it on that day.
They struck it with the mouth of the sword,
while every person who was in it on that day devoted-to-destruction,
exactly as he had done to Lakhish."
Joshua 10:36,"Yehoshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to
Hevron, and did battle with it;"
Joshua 10:37,"they captured it
and struck it with the mouth of the sword,
along with its king and all its towns and every person that was in it—
he left no survivor,
exactly as he had done to Eglon:
he devoted-it-to-destruction, and every person who was in it."
Joshua 10:38,"Yehoshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Devir, and did battle with it;"
Joshua 10:39,"he captured it along with its king and all its towns,
and struck them with the mouth of the sword and devoted-to-destruction every person that was in it—
he left no survivor;
as he had done to Hevron, thus he did to Devir and to its king,
as they had done to Livna and to its king."
Joshua 10:40,"So Yehoshua struck the entire land:
the highlands, the Negev, the lowlands, and the slopes,
along with all of their kings—
he left no survivor,
while all those breathing he devoted-to-destruction,
as Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, had commanded."
Joshua 10:41,"Yehoshua struck them from Kadesh-Barne’a to Gaza,
and all the region of Goshen and as far as Giv’on."
Joshua 10:42,"All these kings and their land, Yehoshua captured at one time,
since Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, was doing battle for Israel."
Joshua 10:43,"Then Yehoshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal."
Joshua 11:1,"Now it was,
when Yavin king of Hatzor heard,
that he sent to Yovav king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Akhshaf,"
Joshua 11:2,"and to the [other] kings that were in the north,
in the highlands and in the plain south of the Kinneret and in the lowlands
and in the Heights of Dor, toward the Sea,"
Joshua 11:3,"the Canaanites toward sunrise and toward the Sea,
and the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Yevusites in the highlands,
and the Hivvites beneath Hermon, in the region of Mitzpa."
Joshua 11:4,"They went out, they and all their camps with them,
an abundance of fighting-people, like the sand that is on the seashore in abundance,
and horse and chariot, an exceedingly abundant [number]."
Joshua 11:5,"All these kings met;
they came and encamped together at the Waters of Merom, to do battle with Israel."
Joshua 11:6,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Do not be afraid before them,
for tomorrow at this same time I myself will make all of them slain-ones before Israel;
their horses you will maim,
and their chariots you will burn with fire!"
Joshua 11:7,"So Yehoshua came, and all the people of battle with him, against them by the Waters of Merom, suddenly,
and they fell upon them."
Joshua 11:8,"Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them
and pursued them as far as Greater Sidon and up to Misrefot-Mayim and as far as the Cleft of Mitzpe, toward sunrise—
they struck them until they had left them no survivor."
Joshua 11:9,"Yehoshua did to them as Y<small>HWH</small> had said to him:
their horses he maimed, and their chariots he burned with fire."
Joshua 11:10,"And Yehoshua turned back at that time and captured Hatzor,
while its king he struck down with the sword,
for Hatzor in former-times was the head [city] of all of these kingdoms."
Joshua 11:11,"They struck down every person who was in it, with the mouth of the sword;
he devoted-them-to-destruction
—no one breathing remained—
while Hatzor he burned with fire."
Joshua 11:12,"And all the towns of these kings, along with all their kings, Yehoshua captured and struck them with the mouth of the sword;
he devoted-them-to-destruction,
as Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had commanded."
Joshua 11:13,"However: all the towns that were standing on their mounds, Israel did not burn;
only Hatzor alone did Yehoshua burn."
Joshua 11:14,"Now all the spoils of these towns, and all the cattle, the Children of Israel plundered for themselves;
only all the humans did they strike down with the mouth of the sword, until they had wiped them out—
they left no one breathing."
Joshua 11:15,"As Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe his servant,
thus had Moshe commanded Yehoshua,
and thus Yehoshua did;
he did not omit a thing of all that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Joshua 11:16,"So Yehoshua took all this land:
the highlands, all the Negev, and all the region of Goshen,
the lowlands, and the Plain,
the highlands of Israel and its lowlands,"
Joshua 11:17,"from Mount Halak that goes up toward Se’ir
as far as Baal-Gad in the Cleft of the Levanon, beneath Mount Hermon.
All their kings he captured;
he struck them down and put them to death."
Joshua 11:18,For many years Yehoshua engaged all these kings in battle.
Joshua 11:19,"There was not a town which had concluded peace with the Children of Israel
except for the Hivvites, the settled-folk of Giv’on;
all were taken in battle."
Joshua 11:20,"For it was from Y<small>HWH</small>, to make their heart strong-willed toward battle with Israel,
in order to devote-them-to-destruction,
without there being any compassion toward them;
indeed, it was to wipe them out,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Joshua 11:21,"Yehoshua came at that time
and cut off the Anakites from the highlands, from Hevron, from Devir, from Anav—
from all the highlands of Judah and from all the highlands of Israel;
along with their towns, Yehoshua devoted-them-to-destruction."
Joshua 11:22,"There were no Anakites remaining in the land of the Children of Israel—
only in Gaza, in Gat, and in Ashdod were they left."
Joshua 11:23,"So Yehoshua took all the land,
exactly as Y<small>HWH</small> had promised to Moshe,
and Yehoshua gave it as hereditary-property to Israel, according to their divisions by their tribes.
And the land was quiet from war."
Joshua 12:1,"Now these are the kings of the land
whom the Children of Israel struck down and of whose land they took possession,
across the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,
from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Plain toward sunrise:"
Joshua 12:2,"Sihon king of the Amorites, who sat [enthroned] at Heshbon,
ruling from Aro’er—which is by the bank of Wadi Arnon—and the middle of the wadi, and half of Gil’ad to Yabbok the Wadi, the border of the Children of Ammon,"
Joshua 12:3,"and the Plain as far as the Sea of Kinneret, toward sunrise, and as far as the Sea of the Plain, the Sea of Salt, toward sunrise, by way of Bet-Yeshimmot,
and southward, beneath the slopes <i>of</i> Pisga,"
Joshua 12:4,"as border-territory,
[and] the territory of Og king of Bashan, from the remnant of the Refa’im/Shades, who sat [enthroned] at Ashtarot and at Edre’i,"
Joshua 12:5,"ruling over Mount Hermon and over Salkha and over all of Bashan,
as far as the border of the Geshurites and of the Maakhatites,
and half of Gil’ad, [to] the border of Sihon king of Heshbon."
Joshua 12:6,"Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, and the Children of Israel had struck them down,
and Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had given it as a possession to the Re’uvenites, to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Menashe."
Joshua 12:7,"Now these are the kings of the land whom Yehoshua and the Children of Israel struck down across the Jordan, seaward,
from Baal-Gad in the Levanon Cleft as far as Mount Halak that goes up toward Se’ir;
Yehoshua gave it to the tribes of Israel as a possession, in accordance with their divisions,"
Joshua 12:8,"in the highlands and in the lowlands, in the Plain and in the slopes-region, in the wilderness and in the Negev—
the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
the Perizzites, the Hivvites, and the Yevusites:"
Joshua 12:9,"the king of Jericho, one,
the king of Ai, which is beside Bet-El, one,"
Joshua 12:10,"the king of Jerusalem, one,
the king of Hevron, one,"
Joshua 12:11,"the king of Yarmut, one,
the king of Lakhish, one,"
Joshua 12:12,"the king of Eglon, one,
the king of Gezer, one,"
Joshua 12:13,"the king of Devir, one,
the king of Geder, one,"
Joshua 12:14,"the king of Horma, one,
the king of Arad, one,"
Joshua 12:15,"the king of Livna, one,
the king of Adullam, one,"
Joshua 12:16,"the king of Makkeda, one,
the king of Bet-El, one,"
Joshua 12:17,"the king of Tappu’ah, one,
the king of Heyfer, one,"
Joshua 12:18,"the king of Afek, one,
the king of Lasharon, one,"
Joshua 12:19,"the king of Madon, one,
the king of Hatzor, one,"
Joshua 12:20,"the king of Shimron Meron, one,
the king of Akhshaf, one,"
Joshua 12:21,"the king of Ta’nakh, one,
the king of Megiddo, one,"
Joshua 12:22,"the king of Kedesh, one,
the king of Yokne’am at the Carmel, one,"
Joshua 12:23,"the king of Dor in the Height of Dor, one,
the king of Goyim in Gilgal, one,"
Joshua 12:24,"the king of Tirtza, one;
all the kings, thirty-one."
Joshua 13:1,"Now Yehoshua was old, advanced in years,
and Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
You, you are old, advanced in years,
but the land is left with exceedingly much to possess."
Joshua 13:2,"This is the land that is left:
all the districts of the Philistines and all the Geshurite [region],"
Joshua 13:3,"—from the Shihor, that is facing Egypt, as far as the territory of Ekron northward, reckoned to the Canaanites—
five Philistine overlords: the Gazite and the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite, and the Avvites, in the south;"
Joshua 13:4,"all the land of the Canaanites
including from ’Ara, which belongs to the Sidonians, to Afek, to the territory of the Amorites,"
Joshua 13:5,"the Giblite region and all of the Levanon, toward the rising of the sun,
from Baal-Gad beneath Mount Hermon to Levo-Hamat."
Joshua 13:6,"As for all of the settled-folk of the highlands, from the Levanon to Misrefot-Mayim—all of the Sidonians,
I myself will dispossess them before the Children of Israel.
Only: have it fall to Israel as hereditary-property, as I have commanded you."
Joshua 13:7,"So-now, divide up this land as hereditary-property to the nine tribes and to the half tribe of Menashe."
Joshua 13:8,"Along with it, the Re’uvenites and the Gadites had taken their hereditary-property
that Moshe had given them across the Jordan, toward sunrise,
just as Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had given them:"
Joshua 13:9,"from Aro’er which is at the shore of Wadi Arnon, and the town that is in the middle of the wadi [valley], and all the plateau of Medeva, as far as Divon,"
Joshua 13:10,"and all the towns of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned as king in Heshbon,
as far as the territory of the Children of Ammon,"
Joshua 13:11,"and Gil’ad, and the territory of the Geshurites and the Maakhatites,
and all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan, as far as Salkha,"
Joshua 13:12,"and all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned as king in Ashtarot and in Edre’i
—he was the one left of the remnant of the Shades—:
Moshe had struck them and had dispossessed them,"
Joshua 13:13,"but the Children of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites and the Maakhatites;
Geshur and Maakha have remained settled in the midst of Israel, until this day."
Joshua 13:14,"Only to the tribe of Levi did he not give hereditary-property;
the fire-offerings of Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, are its hereditary-property, as he promised it."
Joshua 13:15,"Moshe had given to the tribe of Re’uven, according to their clans:"
Joshua 13:16,"now the territory for them was
from Aro’er which is at the shore of the Wadi Arnon, and the town that is in the middle of the wadi [valley], and all the plateau around Medeva,"
Joshua 13:17,"Heshbon and all its towns that are on the plateau:
Divon, Bamot-Baal, and Bet-Baal Me’on,"
Joshua 13:18,"Yahtza, Kedemot, and Mefaat,"
Joshua 13:19,"Kiryatayim, Sivma, and Tzeret-Shahar on the mountain of the valley,"
Joshua 13:20,"Bet-Pe’or, the Pisga Slopes, and Bet-Ha-Yeshimmot:"
Joshua 13:21,"including all the towns of the plateau, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned as king in Heshbon,
whom Moshe had struck along with the leaders of Midyan:
Evi, Rekem, Tzur, Hur, and Reva, the chiefs of Sihon, those settled in the land,"
Joshua 13:22,"while Bil’am son of Be’or, the soothsayer, the Children of Israel
killed with the sword, in addition to their slain."
Joshua 13:23,"And the border of the Children of Re’uven was the Jordan, and the bordering-territory.
This was the hereditary-property of the Children of Re’uven for their clans,
the towns and their farmsteads."
Joshua 13:24,"Moshe had given to the tribe of Gad, for the Children of Gad, for their clans:"
Joshua 13:25,"now the territory for them was:
Ya’zer and all the towns of Gil’ad, half the land of the Children of Ammon, as far as Aro’er, which faces Rabba,"
Joshua 13:26,"and from Heshbon as far as Ramat Ha-Mitzpe and Betonim, and from Mahanayim as far as the territory of Lo-Devar,"
Joshua 13:27,"and in the Valley, Bet-Haram, Bet-Nimra, Sukkot, and Tzafon,
the remnant of the kingdoms of Sihon king of Heshbon,
the Jordan and the bordering-territory, as far as the edge of the Sea of Kinneret,
across the Jordan toward sunrise."
Joshua 13:28,"This was the hereditary-property of the Children of Gad, for their clans,
the towns and their farmsteads."
Joshua 13:29,"Moshe had given to the half tribe of Menashe,
for the half group of the Children of Menashe, according to their clans:"
Joshua 13:30,"now their territory was
from Mahanayim, all of Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan,
and all the tent-villages of Ya’ir that were in Bashan, sixty towns;"
Joshua 13:31,"half of Gil’ad,
Ashtarot and Edre’i, towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan,
to the Children of Makhir son of Menashe—to half the Children of Makhir—for their clans."
Joshua 13:32,"These it was that Moshe had given-as-hereditary-property in the Plains of Moav, across the Jordan [at] Jericho, toward sunrise."
Joshua 13:33,"But to the tribe of Levi, Moshe had given no hereditary-property;
Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel—he is their hereditary-property,
as he promised them."
Joshua 14:1,"Now these were what the Children of Israel received-as-hereditary-property in the land of Canaan,
which El’azar the priest and Yehoshua son of Nun and the heads of the Fathers of the tribes among the Children of Israel distributed-as-property to them"
Joshua 14:2,"by the lot as their hereditary-property,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded by the hand of Moshe
for the nine tribes and the half tribe."
Joshua 14:3,"For Moshe had given the hereditary-property of the two tribes and the half tribe across the Jordan,
but to the Levites he had not given hereditary-property in their midst."
Joshua 14:4,"For the Children of Yosef were two tribes, Menashe and Efrayim,
but they had not given a portion to the Levites in the land,
except for some towns to settle in and their pasture-lands for their cattle and their acquisitions."
Joshua 14:5,"As Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe, thus the Children of Israel did;
so they divided up the land."
Joshua 14:6,"The Children of Yehuda approached Yehoshua at Gilgal,
and Calev son of Yefunneh the Kenizzite said to him:
You yourself know the word that Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe the man of God
regarding me and regarding you, at Kadesh-Barne’a."
Joshua 14:7,"Forty years old was I when Moshe the servant of Y<small>HWH</small> sent me from Kadesh- Barne’a to spy out the land,
and I brought him back word, just as was in my heart."
Joshua 14:8,"But my brothers who went up with me melted the heart of the people [with fear],
while I fully-followed after Y<small>HWH</small> my God."
Joshua 14:9,"So Moshe swore on that day, saying:
If the land on which your foot has tread does not become hereditary-property for you and for your children, into the ages … !
since you have fully-followed after Y<small>HWH</small> your God."
Joshua 14:10,"So-now, here, Y<small>HWH</small> has kept me alive, as he promised, these forty-five years,
from when Y<small>HWH</small> spoke this word to Moshe,
when Israel was going through the wilderness.
And now, here, today I am eighty-five years old;"
Joshua 14:11,"I am still as strong today
as on the day of Moshe’s sending me—
as my might was then, so my might is now for battle,
for going out and for coming in."
Joshua 14:12,"So-now, give me these highlands, which Y<small>HWH</small> promised me on that day,
—for you yourself heard on that day—
though Anakites are there, and great and fortified towns;
perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will be with me, and I will dispossess them,
as Y<small>HWH</small> promised."
Joshua 14:13,"So Yehoshua blessed him
and gave Hevron to Calev son of Yefunneh as hereditary-property."
Joshua 14:14,"Therefore Hevron is hereditary-property for Calev son of Yefunneh the Kenizzite, until this day,
because he was fully-true to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel."
Joshua 14:15,"Now the name of Hevron formerly was Kiryat-Arba;
he was the greatest man among the Anakites.
And the land was quiet from war."
Joshua 15:1,"Now the allotment for the tribe of the Children of Yehuda, for their clans, was:
to the border of Edom, at the Wilderness of Tzyn, toward the south, as the rightmost edge."
Joshua 15:2,"The border for them, on the south, was from the edge of the Sea of Salt, from the “tongue” that faces the south."
Joshua 15:3,"Then it goes out south of Scorpions’ Pass, and crosses over to Tzyn.
Then it goes up south of Kadesh-Barne’a
and crosses over to Hetzron and went up to Addar, swinging around to Karka."
Joshua 15:4,"Then it crosses over to Atzmon and goes out to the Wadi of Egypt;
and the outer-reaches of the border are at the Sea
… this will be the border for you on the south."
Joshua 15:5,"And the border on the east: the Sea of Salt, as far as the edge of the Jordan;
and the border on the north side:
from the “tongue” of the Sea, from the edge of the Jordan."
Joshua 15:6,"Then the border goes up to Bet-Hogla, and crosses north of Bet-Arava.
Then the border goes up to the Stone of Bohan son of Re’uven."
Joshua 15:7,"Then the border goes up to Devir from the Valley of Disaster and faces toward Gilgal,
which is opposite Red Pass, which is south of the wadi.
Then the border crosses over to the waters of the Sun Spring;
its outer-reaches are at Rogel Spring."
Joshua 15:8,"Then the border goes up the Ravine of the Son of Hinnom, along the shoulder of the Yevusite, on the south—that is Jerusalem.
Then the border goes up to the top of the hill that faces the Ravine of Ben Hinnom, seaward,
which is at the edge of the Valley of the Shades, northward."
Joshua 15:9,"Then the border diverges from the top of the hill at the Spring of the Waters of Neftoah and goes out to the towns of Mount Efron.
Then the border diverges toward Baala—that is Kiryat-Ye’arim."
Joshua 15:10,"Then the border swings around from Baala seaward to Mount Se’ir,
and crosses to the shoulder of Mount Ye’arim, northward—that is Kesalon—
and goes down to Bet-Shemesh and crosses over by Timna."
Joshua 15:11,"Then the border goes out to the shoulder of Ekron, northward.
Then the border diverges toward Shikkeron and crosses to Mount Baala.
Then it goes out to Yavne’el;
the outer-reaches of the border are at the Sea."
Joshua 15:12,"And the seaward border
is the Great Sea, and the [adjacent] territory.
This is the border of the Children of Yehuda, all around, for their clans."
Joshua 15:13,"Now to Calev son of Yefunneh he gave a portion amid the Children of Yehuda, at Y<small>HWH</small>’s order to Yehoshua:
Kiryat-Arba, the father of the Anakites—that is Hevron."
Joshua 15:14,"And Calev dispossessed from there the three sons of Anak—Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, those born of Anak."
Joshua 15:15,"He went up from there against the settled-folk of Devir
—now the name of Devir formerly was Kiryat-Sefer."
Joshua 15:16,"And Calev said:
The one who strikes Kiryat-Sefer and captures it,
I will give him Akhsa my daughter as a wife!"
Joshua 15:17,"Otniel son of Kenaz, Calev’s brother, captured it,
so he gave him Akhsa his daughter as a wife."
Joshua 15:18,"And it was when she came, that she induced him to request a field from her father.
When she alighted from the donkey, Calev said to her:
What [ails] you?"
Joshua 15:19,"She said:
Give me a gift-of-blessing!
Indeed, you have given me arid land;
you should give me pools of water!
So he gave her the Upper Pools and the Lower Pools."
Joshua 15:20,"This is the hereditary-property of the tribe of the Children of Yehuda, for their clans:"
Joshua 15:21,"the towns at the edge of the tribe of the Children of Yehuda
toward the border of Edom, in the Negev:
Kavtze’el, Eider, and Yagur,"
Joshua 15:22,"Kina, Dimona, and Ad’ada,"
Joshua 15:23,"Kedesh and Hatzar-Yitnan,"
Joshua 15:24,"Zif, Telem, and Be’alot,"
Joshua 15:25,"Hatzor-Hadatta and the hamlets of Hetzron—that is Hatzor,"
Joshua 15:26,"Amam, Shema, and Molada,"
Joshua 15:27,"Hatzar-Gadda, Heshmon, and Bet-Pelet,"
Joshua 15:28,"Hatzar-Shual, Be’er-Sheva, and Bizyotya,"

Joshua 15:30,"Eltolad, Kesil, and Horma,"
Joshua 15:31,"Tziklag, Madmanna, and Sansanna,"
Joshua 15:32,"Levaot, Shilhim, and Rimmon Spring—
all the towns: twenty-nine, and their farmsteads."
Joshua 15:33,"In the lowlands:
Eshtaol, Tzor’a, and Ashna,"
Joshua 15:34,"Zanoah and Gannim Spring,
Tappu’ah and Enam,"
Joshua 15:35,"Yarmut and Adullam,
Sokho and Azeka,"
Joshua 15:36,"Shaarayim and Aditayim,
Gedera and Gederotayim—
towns, fourteen, and their farmsteads;"

Joshua 15:44,"Ke’ila, Akhziv, and Maresha—
towns, nine, and their farmsteads;"
Joshua 15:45,"Ekron and its daughter-towns, and its farmsteads,"
Joshua 15:46,"from Ekron seaward
all those near Ashdod, and their farmsteads,"
Joshua 15:47,"Ashdod, its daughter-towns and its farmsteads,
Gaza, its daughter-towns and its farmsteads,
as far as the Wadi of Egypt, up to the Great Sea and the border-territory;"
Joshua 15:48,"in the highlands:
Shamir, Yattir, and Sokho,"
Joshua 15:49,"Danna, Kiryat-Sanna—that is Devir,"
Joshua 15:50,"Anav, Eshtemo, and Anim,"
Joshua 15:51,"Goshen, Holon, and Gilo—
towns, eleven, and their farmsteads;"
Joshua 15:52,"Arav, Duma, and Esh’an,"
Joshua 15:53,"Yanum, Bet-Tappuah, and Afeka,"
Joshua 15:54,"Humta, Kiryat-Arba—that is Hevron—and Tzi’or—

towns, ten, and their farmsteads;"
Joshua 15:58,"Halhul, Bet-Tzur, and Gedor,"
Joshua 15:59,"Maarat, Bet-Anot, and Eltekon—
towns, six, and their farmsteads;"

towns, two, and their farmsteads;"
Joshua 15:61,"in the wilderness:
Bet-Arava, Middin, and Sekhakha,"
Joshua 15:62,"Nivshan, Salt City, and En-Gedi—
towns, six, and their farmsteads."
Joshua 15:63,"Now as for the Yevusites, the settled-folk of Jerusalem,
the Children of Yehuda were not able to dispossess them,
so the Yevusites are settled with the Children of Yehuda in Jerusalem, until this day."
Joshua 16:1,"And the allotment for the Children of Yosef went out from Jordan [at] Jericho, to the waters of Jericho, toward sunrise, into the wilderness,
going up from Jericho through the highlands to Bet-El."
Joshua 16:2,"Then it goes out from Bet-El to Luz,
and crosses to the border of the Arkites at Atarot."
Joshua 16:3,"Then it goes down seaward to the border of the Yafletites, as far as the border of Lower Bet-Horon and as far as Gezer;
its outer-reaches are at the Sea."
Joshua 16:4,"Thus were the Children of Yosef, Menashe and Efrayim, given hereditary-property."
Joshua 16:5,"Now the boundary of the Children of Efrayim, according to their clans, was:
the border of their hereditary-property was, toward sunrise, from Atarot-Addar as far as Upper Bet-Horon."
Joshua 16:6,"Then the border goes out seaward to Mikhmetat on the north.
Then the border swings around toward sunrise to Taanat Shilo,
and crosses by it, sunrise to Yanoah."
Joshua 16:7,"Then it goes down from Yanoah to Atarot and to Naara and touches Jericho, and goes out to the Jordan;"
Joshua 16:8,"from Tappuah the border goes seaward, to the Wadi Kama,
and its outer-reaches are at the Sea.
This is the hereditary-property of the Children of Efrayim, for their clans,"
Joshua 16:9,"with the towns set apart for the Children of Efrayim amid the hereditary-property of the Children of Menashe,
all the towns and their farmsteads."
Joshua 16:10,"But they were not able to dispossess the Canaanites, those settled in Gezer,
so the Canaanites remained settled amid Efrayim, to this day;
they became laboring serfs."
Joshua 17:1,"And the allotment for the tribe of Menashe was—since he was the firstborn of Yosef—
for Makhir firstborn of Menashe, father of Gil’ad, since he was a man of battle,
and Gil’ad and Bashan belonged to him [already]."
Joshua 17:2,"So it was for the rest of the Children of Menashe, according to their clans:
for the Children of Avi’ezer, for the Children of Helek, for the Children of Asriel, for the Children of Shekhem, for the Children of Heyfer, for the Children of Shemida—
these were the Children of Menashe son of Yosef, the males for their clans."
Joshua 17:3,"Now Tzelofhad son of Heyfer son of Gil’ad son of Makhir son of Menashe—he had no sons, but rather daughters,
and these were his daughters’ names:
Mahla, No’a, Hogla, Milka, and Tirtza."
Joshua 17:4,"They came before El’azar the priest and before Yehoshua son of Nun and before the exalted-leaders, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe to give us hereditary-property amid our brothers!
And they were given, by the order of Y<small>HWH</small>, hereditary-property amid their father’s brothers."
Joshua 17:5,"The measured-areas falling to Menashe [were] ten,
aside from the land of Gil’ad and Bashan, which are across the Jordan,"
Joshua 17:6,"for the daughters of Menashe inherited hereditary-property amid their brothers,
while the land of Gil’ad was for the rest of the Children of Menashe."
Joshua 17:7,"And the border of Menashe was:
from Asher to Mikhmetat, which faces Shekhem,
then the border goes to the right/the south, toward Yashuv [and] En Tappuah,"
Joshua 17:8,"—belonging to Menashe was the region of Tappuah, but Tappuah is on the border of Menashe, belonging to the Children of Efrayim—"
Joshua 17:9,"then the border goes down to the Wadi Kana.
South of the wadi, these towns belonged to Efrayim amid the towns of Menashe;
the border of Menashe was north of the wadi,
and all their outer-reaches are at the Sea."
Joshua 17:10,"The southland belongs to Efrayim and the north belongs to Menashe, and the Sea is its border;
Asher they touch on the north, and Yissakhar toward sunrise."
Joshua 17:11,"There belonged to Menashe in Yissakhar and Asher:
Bet-She’an and its daughter-towns, Yivle’am and its daughter-towns,
along with the settled-folk of Dor and its daughter-towns,
the settled-folk of En Dor and its daughter-towns, the settled-folk of Ta’nakh and its daughter-towns, and the settled-folk of Megiddo and its daughter-towns, the Three Heights."
Joshua 17:12,"But the Children of Menashe were not able to dispossess these towns;
the Canaanites persisted in remaining-settled in this land."
Joshua 17:13,"It was, when the Children of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites into forced-labor,
but dispossess, they could not dispossess them."
Joshua 17:14,"Now the Children of Yosef spoke to Yehoshua, saying:
For-what-reason have you given me as hereditary-property [only] one allotment, one area?
For I am a numerous people,
since until now Y<small>HWH</small> has blessed me greatly!"
Joshua 17:15,"Yehoshua said to them:
If you are [such] a numerous people,
go you up into the forest
and clear [ground] for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Refaites,
since the highlands of Efrayim are too confining for you!"
Joshua 17:16,"The Children of Yosef said:
There is not [enough] for us in the highlands,
but iron chariots are everywhere among the Canaanites who are settled in the valley region,
those in Bet-She’an and its daughter-towns and those in the Valley of Yizre’el."
Joshua 17:17,"Yehoshua said to the House of Yosef, to Efrayim and to Menashe, saying:
You are a numerous people,
and you have great might;
you shall not have [just] one allotment,"
Joshua 17:18,"for the highlands shall be yours, since it is forest—
you are to clear it, and its outer-reaches will be yours,
for you will dispossess the Canaanites,
though they have iron chariots,
though they are strong."
Joshua 18:1,"Now the entire community of the Children of Israel assembled at Shilo
and they set up there the Tent of Appointment,
since the land was subdued before them."
Joshua 18:2,"And there remained among the Children of Israel, whose hereditary-property had not been divided up, seven tribes."
Joshua 18:3,"So Yehoshua said to the Children of Israel:
Until when will you show yourselves slack
in coming, in settling the land that Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of your Fathers, has given you?"
Joshua 18:4,"Provide yourselves three men per tribe, that I may send them out
Let them arise and walk about in the land,
that they may write it up according to their hereditary-property;
then let them come back to me."
Joshua 18:5,"They are to divide it among themselves into seven divisions:
Judah will be situated on his territory in the Negev,
while the House of Yosef will be situated on their territory in the north."
Joshua 18:6,"As for you, you are to write up the land as seven portions and have it come to me here,
that I may cast the lot for you here, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> our God."
Joshua 18:7,"For the Levites have no portion in your midst,
since the priesthood of Y<small>HWH</small> is their hereditary-property,
and Gad, Re’uven, and the half tribe of Menashe have taken their hereditary-property across the Jordan, toward sunrise,
which Moshe, the servant of God, gave them."
Joshua 18:8,"The men arose and were about to go,
and Yehoshua commanded those who were going to write up the land, saying:
Go, go about through the land and write it up, and return to me;
it is here that I shall cast lots for you in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> at Shilo."
Joshua 18:9,"The men went and crossed through the land,
and they wrote it up, regarding the towns, as seven portions, in a record;
then they came back to Yehoshua in the camp at Shilo."
Joshua 18:10,"And Yehoshua cast lots for them at Shilo, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and Yehoshua divided up the land there for the Children of Israel, according to their divisions."
Joshua 18:11,"The lot came up of the tribe of the Children of Binyamin, for their clans:
the territory of their allotment went out between the Children of Judah and the Children of Yosef;"
Joshua 18:12,"the border for them, on the northern side, [starting] from the Jordan.
Then the border goes up to the shoulder of Jericho on the north and goes up into the highlands, seaward;
its outer-reaches are at the Wilderness of Bet-Aven."
Joshua 18:13,"Then the border crosses from there to Luz, on the shoulder of Luz, toward the Negev
—that is Bet-El.
Then the border goes down toward Atarot-Addar,
on the hill that faces Lower Bet-Horon."
Joshua 18:14,"Then the border diverges and swings around on the seaward side, toward the Negev, from the hill that faces Bet-Horon, toward the Negev;
its outer-reaches are at Kiryat-Baal—that is Kiryat-Ye’arim, a town of the Children of Yehuda—
that is the seaward side."
Joshua 18:15,"And on the Negev side, from the edge of Kiryat-Ye’arim,
the border goes seaward, and then goes out to the Spring of the Waters of Neftoah."
Joshua 18:16,"Then the border goes down to the edge of the hill that faces the Ravine of the Son of Hinnom, that is in the Valley of the Shades, northward.
Then it goes down in the Ravine of Hinnom to the Yevusite shoulder, toward the Negev,
and goes down to Rogel Spring."
Joshua 18:17,"Then it diverges from the north
and comes out at the Spring of the Sun.
Then it goes out Gelilot, that is opposite Red Pass.
Then it goes down to the Stone of Bohan son of Re’uven."
Joshua 18:18,"Then it crosses to the shoulder opposite the Plain, northward,
and goes down to the Plain."
Joshua 18:19,"Then the border crosses to the shoulder of Bet-Hogla, on the north;
the outer-reaches of the border are at the tongue of the Sea of Salt, on the north,
at the edge of the Jordan, on the south-side
—that is the border on the south."
Joshua 18:20,"And the Jordan borders it on the eastern side.
This is the hereditary-property of the Children of Binyamin, for their clans, according to its borders all around, for their clans."
Joshua 18:21,"And the towns that were the tribe of the Children of Binyamin’s, for their clans, are:
Jericho, Bet-Hogla, and Emek Ketzitz,"
Joshua 18:22,"Bet-Arava, Tzemarayim, and Bet-El,"
Joshua 18:23,"Avvim, Para, and Ofra,"
Joshua 18:24,"Kefar-Ammona, Ofni, and Geva—
towns, twelve, and their farmsteads;"
Joshua 18:25,"Giv’on, Rama, and Be’erot,"
Joshua 18:26,"Mitzpe, Kefira, and Motza,"
Joshua 18:27,"Rekem, Yirpael, and Tar’ala,"
Joshua 18:28,"Tzela, Elef, the Yevusite—that is Jerusalem,
Giv’at and Kiryat__—
towns, fourteen, and their farmsteads.
This was the hereditary-property of Binyamin, for their clans."
Joshua 19:1,"The second lot came out for Shim’on, for the tribe of the Children of Shim’on, for their clans;
their hereditary-property was amid the hereditary-property of the Children of Yehuda."
Joshua 19:2,"They had in their hereditary-property:
Be’er-Sheva, Sheva, and Molada,"
Joshua 19:3,"Hatzar-Shual, Bala, and Etzem,"

towns, four, and their farmsteads;"
Joshua 19:8,"and all the farmsteads that are around these towns, as far as Baalat-Be’er, [and] Ramat Negev.
This is the hereditary-property of the tribe of Shim’on, for their clans."
Joshua 19:9,"From the area of the Children of Yehuda was the hereditary-property of the Children of Shim’on,
for the portion of the Children of Yehuda was too large for them,
so the Children of Shim’on received hereditary-property amid their hereditary-property."
Joshua 19:10,"The third lot came up for the Children of Zevulun for their clans;
the border of their hereditary-property is as far as Sarid."
Joshua 19:11,"Their border goes up toward the Sea and Mar’ala, touching Dabbeshet,
and touches the wadi that faces Yokne’am."
Joshua 19:12,"Then it turns from Sarid eastward, toward the rising of the sun, to the border of Kislot-Tavor,
and goes out at Dav’rat, going up to Yafi’a;"
Joshua 19:13,"from there it crosses eastward, toward sunrise, to Gat-Heyfer and to Et-Katzin.
Then it goes out to Rimmon, diverging to Nei’a."
Joshua 19:14,"Then the border swings around it, north to Hannaton;
its outer-reaches are the Ravine of Yiftah-El,"
Joshua 19:15,"with Kattat, Nahalal, Shimron, Yid’ala, and Bet-Lehem—
towns, twelve, and their farmsteads."
Joshua 19:16,"This is the hereditary-property of the Children of Zevulun, for their clans,
these towns and their farmsteads."
Joshua 19:17,"For Yissakhar the fourth lot came out,
for the Children of Yissakhar, for their clans;"

Joshua 19:21,"Remet, En-Gannim, En-Hadda, and Bet-Patzetz."
Joshua 19:22,"The border touches Tavor, Shahatim, and Bet-Shemesh;
the outer-reaches of their border are at the Jordan—
towns, sixteen, and their farmsteads."
Joshua 19:23,"This is the hereditary-property of the tribe of the Children of Yissakhar, for their clans,
the towns and their farmsteads."
Joshua 19:24,"The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the Children of Asher, for their clans."
Joshua 19:25,"Their border was
[along] Helkat, Hali, Beten, and Akhshaf,"
Joshua 19:26,"Alamelekh, Am’ad, and Mish’al;
it touches Carmel seaward, and Shihor Livnat."
Joshua 19:27,"Then it returns toward the rising of the sun, to Bet-Dagon, and touches Zevulun and the Ravine of Yiftah-El, northward, to Bet-Emek and Ne’iel,
and goes out toward Cavul on the left/the west,"
Joshua 19:28,"and Evron, Rehov, Hammon, Kana, as far as Greater Sidon."
Joshua 19:29,"Then the border turns to Rama, and as far as the fortified city of Tyre.
Then the border turns to Hosa;
and its outer-reaches are at the Sea, Mahalav, Akhziv,"
Joshua 19:30,"and Umma, Afek, and Rehov—
towns, twenty-two, and their farmsteads."
Joshua 19:31,"This is the hereditary-property of the tribe of the Children of Asher, for their clans,
these towns and their farmsteads."
Joshua 19:32,"For the Children of Naftali the sixth lot came out,
for the tribe of Naftali, for their clans;"
Joshua 19:33,"their border was
from Helef, from the Oak in Tzaananim, Adami-Nekev and Yavne’el, as far as Lakkum;
its outer-reaches are at the Jordan."
Joshua 19:34,"The border turns seaward to Aznot-Tavor, and goes out from there to Hukkok.
Then it touches Zevulun on the south and touches Asher seaward, and Yehuda, [with] the Jordan toward the rising of the sun,"
Joshua 19:35,"along with the fortified towns—
Tziddim, Tzer, Hammat, Rakkat, and Kinneret,"

Joshua 19:37,"Kedesh, Edre’i, and En Hatzor,"
Joshua 19:38,"Yir’on and Migdal-El,

towns, nineteen, and their farmsteads."
Joshua 19:39,"This is the hereditary-property of the tribe of the Children of Naftali, for their clans,
the towns and their farmsteads."
Joshua 19:40,"For the tribe of the Children of Dan, according to their clans,
the seventh lot came out;"
Joshua 19:41,"and the territory of their hereditary-property was:
Tzor’a, Eshtaol, and the city of Shemesh,"
Joshua 19:42,"Shaalabin, Ayyalon, and Yitla,"
Joshua 19:43,"Eilon, Timna, and Ekron,"
Joshua 19:44,"Eltekei, Gibbeton, and Baalat,"
Joshua 19:45,"Yehud, Benei Berak, and Gat-Rimmon,"
Joshua 19:46,"Mei Yarkon and Rakkon, with the territory opposite Yafo."
Joshua 19:47,"But the territory of the Children of Dan got away from them,
so the Children of Dan went up and did battle with Leshem, and took it,
they struck it with the mouth of the sword
and dispossessed it and settled in it.
And they called Leshem: Dan, in accordance with the name of Dan, their ancestral-father."
Joshua 19:48,"This was the hereditary-property of the tribe of the Children of Dan, for their clans,
these towns and their farmsteads."
Joshua 19:49,"So they had finished providing-inheritance in the land, according to its borders.
Then the Children of Israel gave hereditary-property to Yehoshua son of Nun in their midst—"
Joshua 19:50,"in accordance with the order of Y<small>HWH</small>, they gave him the town he had requested, Timnat-Serah in the highlands of Efrayim;
he built up the town and settled in it."
Joshua 19:51,"These are the hereditary-properties that El’azar the priest and Yehoshua son of Nun and the heads of the Fathers of the tribes distributed-as-hereditary-property to the Children of Israel by lot,
at Shilo, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.
Thus they finished dividing up the land."
Joshua 20:1,"And Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Yehoshua, saying:"
Joshua 20:2,"Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:
Provide for yourselves the Towns of Asylum of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moshe,"
Joshua 20:3,"for fleeing to by an [accidental] murderer, one who strikes down a life in error, without forethought,
that they may be asylum for you from the blood redeemer."
Joshua 20:4,"He shall flee to one of these towns
and stand at the entrance to the town gate
and speak his words in the hearing of the elders of that town.
They shall receive him into the town, to themselves,
and give him a place, that he may settle beside them."
Joshua 20:5,"And if the blood redeemer pursues after him,
they are not to hand over the murderer—
for without foreknowledge did he strike down his neighbor;
he did not hate him from yesterday [or] the day-before."
Joshua 20:6,"Let him stay in that town until he stands before the community in judgment,
until the death of the Great Priest that is there in those days;
then the murderer may return and come into his town and into his house, to the town from which he fled."
Joshua 20:7,"So they hallowed Kedesh in the Galilee, in the highlands of Naftali,
and Shekhem in the highlands of Efrayim,
and Kiryat-Arba—that is Hevron—in the highlands of Judah;"
Joshua 20:8,"and across from the Jordan [at] Jericho, toward the rising of the sun,
they provided Betzer in the wilderness, on the Plateau, from the tribe of Re’uven,
and Ramot in Gil’ad, from the tribe of Gad,
and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Menashe."
Joshua 20:9,"These were the Towns of Appointment for all the Children of Israel and for the sojourner who sojourns among them,
to which might flee anyone striking down a person in error,
so that he might not die at the hands of the blood redeemer,
until his standing before the community."
Joshua 21:1,"The heads of the Levite Father’s [Houses] approached El’azar the priest and Yehoshua son of Nun
and the heads of the tribal Father’s [Houses] of the Children of Israel"
Joshua 21:2,"and spoke to them at Shilo, in the land of Canaan, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> commanded by the hand of Moshe to give us towns to settle in, and their pasture-lands for our animals!"
Joshua 21:3,"So the Children of Israel gave the Levites [land] from their hereditary-property, by order of Y<small>HWH</small>,
these towns and their pasture-lands."
Joshua 21:4,"The lot came out for the Kehatite clans;
for the Children of Aharon the Priest, from the Levites were:
from the tribe of Yehuda, from the Shim’onite tribe, and from the tribe of Binyamin, by lot—
towns, thirteen;"
Joshua 21:5,"and for the Children of Kehat who remained from the clans of the tribe of Efrayim and from the tribe of Dan and from the half tribe of Menashe, by the lot—
towns, ten;"
Joshua 21:6,"and for the Children of Gershon:
from the clans of the tribe of Yissakhar and from the tribe of Asher and from the tribe of Naftali and from the half tribe of Menashe, in Bashan, by lot—
towns, thirteen;"
Joshua 21:7,"and for the Children of Merari, for their clans:
from the tribe of Re’uven and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zevulun—
towns, twelve."
Joshua 21:8,"The Children of Israel gave the Levites these towns and their pasture-lands,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded by the hand of Moshe, by lot."
Joshua 21:9,"They gave, from the tribe of the Children of Yehuda and from the tribe of the Children of Shim’on, these towns which they called by name;"
Joshua 21:10,"it was for the Children of Aharon, from the Kehatite clans from the Children of Levi,
for theirs was the first lot:"
Joshua 21:11,"they gave them Kiryat-Arba, the father of Anak—that is Hevron, in the highlands of Judah, with its pasture-lands all around it,"
Joshua 21:12,while the open-field of the city and its farmsteads they gave to Calev son of Yefunneh as his holding;
Joshua 21:13,"to the Children of Aharon the Priest they gave a town of asylum for the [accidental] murderer—
Hevron and its pasture-lands,"
Joshua 21:14,"Livna and its pasture-lands,
Yattir and its pasture-lands,"
Joshua 21:15,"Eshtemoa and its pasture-lands,
Holon and its pasture-lands,"
Joshua 21:16,"Devir and its pasture-lands,

Geva and its pasture-lands,"
Joshua 21:18,"Anatot and its pasture-lands,
and Almon and its pasture-lands—
towns, four;"

thirteen towns and their pasture-lands."
Joshua 21:20,"Now for the clans of the Children of Kehat, the Levites who remained from the Children of Kehat,
the towns of their allotment were from the tribe of Efrayim."
Joshua 21:21,"They gave them a town of asylum for the murderer—
Shekhem and its pasture-lands, in the highlands of Efrayim,"
Joshua 21:22,"Gezer and its pasture-lands,
Kivtzayim and its pasture-lands,

and Yivle’am and its pasture-lands—
towns, two;"
Joshua 21:26,"all the towns were ten, and their pasture-lands, according to the clans of the Children of Kehat who remained."
Joshua 21:27,"And for the Children of Gershon, from the Levite clans:

and Kartan and its pasture-lands—
towns, three."
Joshua 21:33,"All the towns of the Gershonites were, according to their clans—

Joshua 21:38,"All the towns for the Children of Merari, according to their remaining clans from the Levite clans,
their allotment was towns, twelve."
Joshua 21:39,"All the towns of the Levites amid the holdings of the Children of Israel,
[were] towns, forty-eight, and their pasture-lands;"
Joshua 21:40,"these towns were, town by town, [considered] along with its pasture-lands all around it,
thus for all these towns."
Joshua 21:41,"So Y<small>HWH</small> gave to Israel all the land that he had sworn to give to their fathers;
they took possession of it and settled in it."
Joshua 21:42,"And Y<small>HWH</small> gave rest to them round about,
just as he had sworn to their fathers,
so that no man was able to stand up before them among all their enemies—
all their enemies, Y<small>HWH</small> gave into their hand."
Joshua 21:43,"There did not fail one thing of all the good things
that Y<small>HWH</small> had promised to the House of Israel;
all of it came-to-pass."
Joshua 22:1,"Then Yehoshua called the Re’uvenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menashe"
Joshua 22:2,"and said to them:
You yourselves have kept all that Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, commanded you,
and you have hearkened to my voice in all that I have commanded you:"
Joshua 22:3,"you have not abandoned your brothers these many years, until this day,
but you have kept the keeping
of the commandment of Y<small>HWH</small> your God."
Joshua 22:4,"But now, Y<small>HWH</small> your God has given rest to your brothers, as he promised them.
So-now, face about and go you forth to your tents, to the land of your holdings
which Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, gave to you across the Jordan."
Joshua 22:5,"Only: be very careful to observe the commandment and the Instruction that Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, commanded you:
to love Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to cleave to him
and to serve him
with all your heart and with all your being!"
Joshua 22:6,"So Yehoshua blessed them and sent them off, and they went back to their tents."
Joshua 22:7,"Now to the half tribe of Menashe, Moshe had given [a share] in Bashan,
and to its [other] half Yehoshua had given-share beside their brothers, across the Jordan, seaward.
And also, when he had sent them off to their tents, he had blessed them"
Joshua 22:8,"and had said to them, saying:
With much wealth return to your tents, and with exceedingly many livestock,
and with silver and with gold and with bronze and with iron and with clothing, exceedingly much;
portion out your enemies’ spoils with your brothers!"
Joshua 22:9,"So they returned and went, the Children of Re’uven, the Children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menashe, from among the Children of Israel,
from Shilo which is in the land of Canaan,
to go to the land of Gil’ad, to the land of their holding which they had made-as-their-holding
in accordance with the order of Y<small>HWH</small>, by the hand of Moshe."
Joshua 22:10,"They came to the districts of the Jordan which are in the land of Canaan,
and the Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad and the half tribe of Menashe built a sacrificial-altar there, by the Jordan,
an altar large to see."
Joshua 22:11,"Now the Children of Israel heard it said:
Here, the Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad and the half tribe of Menashe have built an altar opposite the land of Canaan,
in the districts of the Jordan, across from the Children of Israel—"
Joshua 22:12,"the Children of Israel heard [it], and so they assembled, the entire community of the Children of Israel, at Shilo,
to go up against them in force."
Joshua 22:13,"And the Children of Israel sent Pin’has son of El’azar the priest
to the Children of Re’uven, to the Children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Menashe, in the land of Gil’ad,"
Joshua 22:14,"and ten exalted-leaders with him—one leader, one leader [apiece] per Father’s House among all the tribes of Israel,
each one a head of his Father’s House were they, among the thousands of Israel."
Joshua 22:15,"They came to the Children of Re’uven, to the Children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Menashe, in the land of Gil’ad
and spoke to them, saying:"
Joshua 22:16,"Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>’s entire community:
What is this sacrilege by which you have committed sacrilege against the God of Israel,
by turning today from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>
by building yourselves an altar
for transgressing today against Y<small>HWH</small>?!"
Joshua 22:17,"Was the iniquity of Pe’or too little for us
from which we have not become purified until this day,
—a plague was upon the community of Y<small>HWH</small>!—"
Joshua 22:18,"that you turn today from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>?
It will be:
should you revolt today against Y<small>HWH</small>,
tomorrow, he will be furious against the entire community of Israel!"
Joshua 22:19,"Surely, if the land of your holdings is polluted, cross you over to the land of Y<small>HWH</small>’s holding, where the Dwelling of Y<small>HWH</small> dwells, and get holdings in our midst—
but against Y<small>HWH</small>, do not revolt!
And against us, do not revolt by building yourselves an altar
apart from the altar for Y<small>HWH</small> our God!"
Joshua 22:20,"Did not Akhan son of Zerah commit sacrilege, yes, sacrilege regarding the devoted-things,
so that there was fury against the entire community of Israel?
And he did not perish as [just] one man for his iniquity?"
Joshua 22:21,"The Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad and the half tribe of Menashe answered;
they spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel:"
Joshua 22:22,"God of gods is Y<small>HWH</small>!
God of gods is Y<small>HWH</small>!
He knows, and Israel itself will know:
if [it was] in revolting or in committing sacrilege against Y<small>HWH</small>
—do not deliver us on this day!—"
Joshua 22:23,"by building ourselves an altar to turn from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>,
or if by offering up offerings-up and grain-gifts,
or if by performing on it sacrifices of <i>shalom</i>,
may Y<small>HWH</small> himself examine it!"
Joshua 22:24,"… if it was not out of deep-concern over a matter that we have done this, saying:
On the morrow your children might say to our children, saying:
What is between you and Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel?"
Joshua 22:25,"As a border between us and you, O Children of Re’uven and Children of Gad, Y<small>HWH</small> made the Jordan;
you have no portion in Y<small>HWH</small>!—
Your children would cause our children to cease holding Y<small>HWH</small> in awe!"
Joshua 22:26,"So we said:
Let us act for ourselves to build an altar,
not for offerings-up, not for sacrifices,"
Joshua 22:27,"but rather as a witness let it be between us and you, and between our generations after us,
[for us] to serve the service of Y<small>HWH</small> in his presence,
through our offerings-up, through our sacrifices, and through our <i>shalom</i>-offerings,
so that your children will not say on the morrow to our children: You have no portion in Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Joshua 22:28,"And we said:
It will be,
if they say [thus] to us and to our generations on the morrow,
then we will say:
See the replica of the altar of Y<small>HWH</small> that our fathers made,
neither for offering-up nor for sacrifice;
rather, it is a witness between us and you!"
Joshua 22:29,"[Heaven] forbid for us to revolt against Y<small>HWH</small>, to turn today from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>
by building an altar for offering-up, for grain-gift, and for sacrifice
aside from the altar of Y<small>HWH</small> our God that is in front of his Dwelling!"
Joshua 22:30,"Pin’has the priest and the leaders of the community and the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him heard
the words that the Children of Re’uven, the Children of Gad, and the Children of Menashe spoke,
and it was good in their eyes;"
Joshua 22:31,"so Pin’has son of El’azar the priest said to the Children of Re’uven, to the Children of Gad, and to the Children of Menashe:
Today we know that Y<small>HWH</small> is in our midst,
in that you did not commit sacrilege against Y<small>HWH</small> with this act-of-sacrilege;
so then, you have rescued the Children of Israel from the hand of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Joshua 22:32,"So Pin’has son of El’azar the priest and the leaders returned from the Children of Re’uven and from the Children of Gad,
from the land of Gil’ad, to the land of Canaan, to the Children of Israel,
and returned word to them."
Joshua 22:33,"The word was good in the eyes of the Children of Israel,
so the Children of Israel blessed God,
and they decided not to go up against them in force,
to wreak ruin on the land in which the Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad were settled."
Joshua 22:34,"And the Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad called the altar [:Witness],
for it is a witness between us
that Y<small>HWH</small> is God!
41–43 <b>all:</b> As previously in 11:16–23, the translation retains the use of the Hebrew term <i>kol</i>, emphasizing the strong (if historically dubious) view that the conquest was total (Meyers 2004). In this usage, it echoes the first chapter of the book."
Joshua 23:1,"It was, many years after Y<small>HWH</small> had given Israel rest from all their enemies round about
—now Yehoshua was old, advanced in years—"
Joshua 23:2,"that Yehoshua called all Israel: its elders, its heads, its judges, and its officials,
and said to them:
I have become old, I am advanced in years."
Joshua 23:3,"Now you yourselves have seen
all that Y<small>HWH</small> your God did to all the nations before you,
for Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
he is the one who does battle for you!"
Joshua 23:4,"See, I cast [lots] for you from these nations that were left, as hereditary-property for your tribes, from the Jordan
—including all the nations that I cut down—and [from] the Great Sea, toward the coming in of the sun."
Joshua 23:5,"Y<small>HWH</small> your God, he will push them out before you
and will dispossess them from before you,
so that you will possess their land,
as Y<small>HWH</small> your God promised you."
Joshua 23:6,"You are to be very strong,
in keeping and in observing all that is written in the Record of the Instruction of Moshe,
so as not to turn aside from it, right or left,"
Joshua 23:7,"so as not to come in among these nations that are left beside you;
the name of their gods you are not to invoke, you are not to swear [by them],
you are not to serve them, you are not to bow down to them."
Joshua 23:8,"Rather, to Y<small>HWH</small> your God you are to cleave, as you have done, to this day!"
Joshua 23:9,"Y<small>HWH</small> your God has dispossessed before you nations great and numerous,
while as for you, no man has stood up before you, to this day."
Joshua 23:10,"One man among you pursues a thousand,
for Y<small>HWH</small> your God, he is the one who does battle for you, as he promised you."
Joshua 23:11,"Take care with your very being
to love Y<small>HWH</small> your God,"
Joshua 23:12,"for if you should turn, yes, turn away and cleave to the rest of these nations, the ones left alongside you,
and marry among them, so that they come among you and you among them,"
Joshua 23:13,"you must know, yes, know that Y<small>HWH</small> your God will not continue to dispossess these nations from before you;
they will become for you a trapping-net and a snare,
a whip in your sides and barbs in your eyes,
until your perishing from off this good ground that Y<small>HWH</small> your God has given you."
Joshua 23:14,"Here, I am going today the way of all the earth;
you know with all your heart and with all your being
that not one thing has failed of all the good things that Y<small>HWH</small> your God promised you;
everything has come-to-pass for you—
not one thing of it has failed!"
Joshua 23:15,"But it shall be,
just as there has come upon you every good thing that Y<small>HWH</small> your God promised you,
so can Y<small>HWH</small> your God cause to come upon you every evil thing,
until he has wiped you from off this good ground that Y<small>HWH</small> your God has given you:"
Joshua 23:16,"if you cross the covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> your God which he commanded you,
and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them,
Y<small>HWH</small>’s anger will flare against you
and you will perish quickly from off the good land that he has given you!"
Joshua 24:1,"Yehoshua gathered all the tribes of Israel at Shekhem;
he called together all the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officials,
and they stationed themselves in the presence of God."
Joshua 24:2,"And Yehoshua said to all the people:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Across the River were your fathers settled in former ages
—Terah father of Avraham and father of Nahor—
and they served other gods."
Joshua 24:3,"But I took your father Avraham from Across the River
and I had him go throughout all the land of Canaan;
I made his seed many and gave him Yitzhak."
Joshua 24:4,"And I gave to Yitzhak—Yaakov and Esav,
I gave to Esav Mount Se’ir for him to possess,
while Yaakov and his children went down to Egypt."
Joshua 24:5,"Then I sent Moshe and Aharon,
and I dealt blows to Egypt, with what I did in its midst,
and afterward I brought you out."
Joshua 24:6,"I brought your fathers out from Egypt, and you came to the Sea,
and Egypt pursued after your fathers with chariots and riders at the Sea of Reeds."
Joshua 24:7,"They cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and he put deep-darkness between you and the Egyptians,
and brought down the Sea upon them, so that it covered them.
Your [own] eyes saw what I did in Egypt!
And you stayed in the wilderness for many years;"
Joshua 24:8,"then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who were settled across the Jordan, and they did battle with you,
but I gave them into your hand, so that you took possession of their land,
and I wiped them out from before you."
Joshua 24:9,"Then Balak son of Tzippor arose, king of Moav, and he waged battle against Israel:
he sent and called for Bil’am son of Be’or to curse you,"
Joshua 24:10,"but I was not willing to hearken to Bil’am,
so he blessed, yes, blessed you,
and I rescued you from his hand."
Joshua 24:11,"Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho,
and they waged battle against you, the landowners of Jericho,
the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivvites, and the Yevusites,
but I gave them into your hand."
Joshua 24:12,"I sent the hornet before you
and it drove them out before you,
[like the] two Amorite kings—not with your sword and not with your bow."
Joshua 24:13,"And I gave you a land for which you did not labor,
towns which you did not build, in which you settled,
vineyards and olive-groves which you did not plant, [and from which] you are eating!"
Joshua 24:14,"So-now,
hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe and serve him in integrity and trust;
remove the gods whom your fathers had served across the River and in Egypt
and serve Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Joshua 24:15,"But if it be evil in your eyes to serve Y<small>HWH</small>,
choose yourselves today whom you wish to serve—
whether the gods whom your fathers who were Across the River served
or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are settled.
But as for me and my household, we will serve Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Joshua 24:16,"The people answered and said:
[Heaven] forbid for us, from abandoning Y<small>HWH</small>
to serve other gods!"
Joshua 24:17,"Rather, Y<small>HWH</small> our God,
<i>he</i> is the one who brought up us and our fathers from the land of Egypt, from a house of serfs,
and who performed before our eyes these great signs
and kept-us-safe on all the way that we went
and among all the peoples through whose midst we crossed—"
Joshua 24:18,"Y<small>HWH</small> has driven out all the peoples, the Amorites, the settled-folk of the land, before us.
We too will serve Y<small>HWH</small>,
indeed, he is our God!"
Joshua 24:19,"And Yehoshua said to the people:
You will not be able to serve Y<small>HWH</small>,
for he is a holy godhead;
he is a zealous God,
and will not bear your transgression and your sins!"
Joshua 24:20,"When you abandon Y<small>HWH</small> and serve foreign gods,
he will turn and do evil to you and will finish you off,
after having done good to you."
Joshua 24:21,"But the people said to Yehoshua:
No, rather, it is Y<small>HWH</small> we will serve!"
Joshua 24:22,"So Yehoshua said to the people:
You are witnesses against yourselves
that you on your part have chosen Y<small>HWH</small> for yourselves, to serve him.
They said:
Witnesses!—"
Joshua 24:23,"So-now, remove the foreign gods that are in your midst,
and incline your heart to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel!"
Joshua 24:24,"The people said to Yehoshua:
It is Y<small>HWH</small> our God we will serve;
to his voice we will hearken!"
Joshua 24:25,"So Yehoshua cut a covenant with the people on that day;
he made them a law and a judgment at Shekhem."
Joshua 24:26,"And Yehoshua wrote down these words in the Record of God’s Instruction.
Then he took a large stone and erected it there,
beneath the tamarisk that was in the Holy-Place of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Joshua 24:27,"And Yehoshua said to all the people:
Here, this stone shall be against us as a witness,
for it has heard all the statements of Y<small>HWH</small> which he spoke with us;
it will be against you as a witness, lest you deny your God!"
Joshua 24:28,"Then Yehoshua sent the people away, each one to his hereditary-property."
Joshua 24:29,"Now it was some time afterward
that Yehoshua son of Nun, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, died, a hundred and ten years old;"
Joshua 24:30,"they buried him in the territory of his hereditary-property, at Timnat-Serah that is in the highlands of Efrayim, north of Mount Gaash."
Joshua 24:31,"And Israel served Y<small>HWH</small> all the days of Yehoshua
and all the days of the elders who [lived] long years after Yehoshua,
who had known all the deeds of Y<small>HWH</small> that he had done for Israel."
Joshua 24:32,"And the bones of Yosef, which the Children of Israel had brought up from Egypt,
they buried in Shekhem, in the portion of open-ground that Yaakov had acquired from the Children of Hamor father of Shekhem, for a hundred <i>kesitas;</i>
it had become hereditary-property for the Children of Yosef."
Joshua 24:33,"And El’azar son of Aharon died;
they buried him on the hill of Pin’has his son, which had been given to him in the highlands of Efrayim."
