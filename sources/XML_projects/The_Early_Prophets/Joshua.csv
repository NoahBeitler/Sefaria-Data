Joshua 2:1,"<b>Moshe:</b> Pronounced <i>mo-SHEH;</i> traditional English “Moses.” <b>Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> As explained above in “On Using This Book,” the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, whose pronunciation is not precisely known, is traditionally transcribed as “the Lord.” Here it is printed according to the way it appears in the Hebrew text, and the reader may choose how to say it (other possibilities include “the Eternal,” <i>“Adonai,”</i> etc.). <b>the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The use of this title links the beginning of Joshua to the conclusion of Deuteronomy (34:5), emphasizing the unbroken continuity between Moshe and his successor. The term is also attached to David and some of the kings of Judah who followed him, indicating the concept of the sacred task of the biblical leader (Gray 986). Regarding Moshe it is used fourteen times in the book of Joshua, a significant patterned number (two times seven). <b>Yehoshua:</b> Pronounced <i>yeho-SHOO-ah;</i> trad. English “Joshua.” <b>the attendant of Moshe:</b> Yehoshua’s title already when we first meet him in Exod. 24:3."
Joshua 2:2,"<b>arise, cross:</b> Kimhi understands this (starting with Heb. <i>q-y-m</i>) in the spirit of “go cross,” or “go ahead and cross.”"
Joshua 2:3,"<b>Every place … to you I have given it:</b> This probably reflects an ancient legal practice of walking out a boundary to establish ownership of territory; see also Gen. 1:14–17, where God has Avraham do the same (Fishbane). The repetition of “give” in the chapter emphasizes that, in ancient legal language, this is a land grant."
Joshua 2:4,"<b>this Levanon:</b> Pronounced <i>leh-vah-NOHN;</i> trad. English “Lebanon,” the “white” mountain range to the north of Israel, from which the present-day country derives its name. <b>the land of the Hittites:</b> Most of the references to “Hittites” in the Bible, and Assyrian documents, seem to refer to a localized Canaanite group, which may or may not be related to the more prominent Hittite kingdoms farther north. <b>the Great Sea:</b> The Mediterranean. <b>territory:</b> Heb. <i>gevul</i> can also, as often throughout the book, mean “border, boundary.”"
Joshua 2:5,"<b>No man will stand up before you:</b> No one will be able to stand against you. <b>not desert you … not abandon you:</b> A new expression of God’s reassurance; Moshe had been told on several occasions that “I will be with you.”
The Spies and Their Hostess: Instead of launching into details about the beginning of a military campaign, as ancient Near Eastern battle accounts conventionally do, the Bible here presents a dramatic story with multiple interests. By focusing on a central character, the prostitute Rahav, who is the only named personality in the narrative (Nelson), the text is able to convey the fear in which the citizens of Jericho hold the Israelites, the practical problems and tensions of conquest, and, above all, the hand of God in what is to come. Rahav’s humanity, unexpected as it is, moves the narrative from a dry reconnaissance account to one of emotional depth.
The story also introduces a key theme in Joshua: trying to explain why some Canaanites are still living among the Israelites in the audience’s time. And since loyalty to God is to be a major factor in the Israelites’ coming military actions, it makes sense to start with a story about Rahav’s and the soldiers’ loyalty to one another.
Fishbane draws attention to the repetition of “send” in the narrative, which marks both “principal actions … and the main spatial units.” But there is more. The repeating vocabulary of the chapter emphasizes, on the one hand, what one would expect—“spies,” “look over,” “search out,” and “seek”—but also the aforementioned “loyalty” (<i>hesed</i>), and, most notably, a verb which in the Torah is often connected to acknowledgment of God’s power by foreigners: “know” (see v.9). In addition, as McCarthy has shown, the vocabulary of fear in vv.9 and 11—“dread,” “quivering,” and “our hearts melted”—recalls phraseology used in the ancient Near East of a common and potent image, the Divine Warrior.
The Israelites achieve their first, and perhaps most stunning, victory, then, not through advanced strategy but via the hand of God, and it is typically manifested through an actor of low social status, Rahav. Liberation from bondage in the book of Exodus began with decisive action taken by women (the midwives, Moshe’s mother and sister, and Pharaoh’s daughter); the conquest of the Promised Land opens similarly."
Joshua 2:6,"Be strong and courageous,
for you yourself will cause this people to inherit the land
that I swore to your fathers to give them."
Joshua 2:7,"Only: be exceedingly strong and courageous
to take care to observe exactly the Instruction that Moshe my servant commanded you;
do not turn aside from it, right or left,
in order that you may prosper wherever you go."
Joshua 2:8,"This Record of the Instruction is not to depart from your mouth—
you are to recite it day and night,
in order that you may take care to observe
exactly what is written in it;
for then you will make your way prosper,
then you will excel."
Joshua 2:9,"Have I not commanded you:
be strong and courageous!?
Do not be terrified, do not be dismayed,
for with you is Y<small>HWH</small> your God, wherever you go!"
Joshua 2:10,"So Yehoshua commanded the officials of the people, saying:"
Joshua 2:11,"Cross through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying:
Prepare yourselves provisions,
for in another three days, you will be crossing this Jordan
to come to take possession of the land that Y<small>HWH</small> your God is giving you to possess."
Joshua 2:12,"Now to the Re’uvenites and to the Gadites and to the half tribe of Menashe, Yehoshua said, saying:"
Joshua 2:13,"Be mindful of the word that Moshe the servant of Y<small>HWH</small> commanded you, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> your God is granting you rest, and will give you this land;"
Joshua 2:14,"your wives, your little-ones, and your livestock will stay
in the land that Moshe gave them across the Jordan,
while you cross over, fully-armed, before your brothers,
all the mighty-men of valor,
and help them"
Joshua 2:15,"until Y<small>HWH</small> grants rest to your brothers like you,
and they too take possession of the land
that Y<small>HWH</small> your God is giving them,
and you return to the land of your possession and possess it,
which Moshe the servant of Y<small>HWH</small> gave you across the Jordan,
at the rising-place of the sun."
Joshua 2:16,"They answered Yehoshua, saying:
Everything that you have commanded us, we will do,
everywhere that you send us, we will go—"
Joshua 2:17,"just as we hearkened to Moshe, so we will hearken to you!
Only: may Y<small>HWH</small> your God be with you, as he was with Moshe!"
Joshua 2:18,"Every man who defies your orders, and does not hearken to your words exactly as you command him, shall be put to death.
Only: be strong and courageous!"
Joshua 3:1,"Yehoshua son of Nun sent twelve men, spies, from Shittim secretly, saying:
Go, look over the land, especially Jericho!
They went and they came to the house of a whore woman—her name was Rahav—
and they lay down there."
Joshua 3:2,"The king of Jericho was told, saying:
Here, some men have come here tonight from the Children of Israel to search out the land!"
Joshua 3:3,"So the king of Jericho sent to Rahav, saying:
Bring out the men who came to you, who came to your house,
for it is to search out the entire land that they have come!"
Joshua 3:4,"But the woman took the two men and concealed them;
then she said:
Certainly, the men came to me,
but I do not know where they were from."
Joshua 3:5,"And it was, as the gate was about to be closed at dark, that the men went out
—I do not know where the men went.
Pursue quickly after them,
for you may overtake them!"
Joshua 3:6,"Now she had brought them up to the roof
and had hidden them in the stalks of flax, the ones arranged by her on the roof."
Joshua 3:7,"Now the men pursued after them by way of the Jordan at the river-crossings,
and they closed the gate, after the pursuers had gone out after them."
Joshua 3:8,"As for them, scarcely had they lay down when <i>she</i> came up to them on the roof."
Joshua 3:9,"She said to the men:
I know
that Y<small>HWH</small> has given you the land,
and that the dread of you has fallen upon us;
all the settled-folk of the land are quivering before you!"
Joshua 3:10,"For we heard about [how] Y<small>HWH</small> dried up the waters of the Sea of Reeds before you when you went out of Egypt,
and what you did to the two Amorite kings who were across the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og,
whom you devoted-to-destruction."
Joshua 3:11,"We heard, and our hearts melted [in fear],
and no life-breath rose within anyone because of you,
for Y<small>HWH</small> your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath!"
Joshua 3:12,"So-now, pray swear to me by Y<small>HWH</small>, that since I have acted toward you with loyalty,
you also will act toward my Father’s House with loyalty
and will give me a trustworthy sign;"
Joshua 3:13,"you will keep alive my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters, and all those belonging to them,
and save our lives from death!"
Joshua 3:14,"The men said to her:
Our life [shall be] in place of yours, to die, as long as you do not tell this business of ours!
And it will be, at Y<small>HWH</small>’s giving the land to us,
that we will act toward you in loyalty and faithfulness."
Joshua 3:15,"Then she let them down by a rope through the window
—for her house was on the outer-part of the wall, and in the wall she dwelt—"
Joshua 3:16,"and she said to them:
To the highlands go, lest the pursuers encounter you,
and hide yourselves there for three days, until the pursuers’ return;
afterward you may go on your way."
Joshua 3:17,"The men said to her:
We are clear of this your sworn-oath which you have had us swear:"
Joshua 3:18,"here, when we come to the land,
this cord of scarlet thread you are to tie in the window through which you let us down,
while your father and your mother and your brothers and all your Father’s Household you are to gather to yourself into the house;"
Joshua 3:19,"and it shall be: whoever goes out of the doors of your house, outside,
his blood will be on his head,
and we will be clear,
while whoever will be with you in the house,
his blood will be on our head, if [any] hand be against him!"
Joshua 3:20,"Now if you tell this business of ours, we will be clear from your sworn-oath that you have had us swear."
Joshua 3:21,"She said:
In accordance with your words, so be it!
So she sent them off, and they went,
and she tied the scarlet cord through the window."
Joshua 3:22,"They went off and came to the highlands, and stayed there for three days,
until the pursuers returned;
the pursuers sought them all along the way, but did not find [them]."
Joshua 3:23,"The two men came down again from the highlands;
they crossed over and came to Yehoshua son of Nun, and recounted to him all that had befallen them:"
Joshua 3:24,"they said to Yehoshua:
Indeed, Y<small>HWH</small> has given the entire land into our hand,
and also all the settled-folk of the land are quivering before us!

Joshua 3:25,"<b>Be strong and courageous:</b> Heb. <i>hazak ve-ematz</i>. As God has already said to Moshe in Deut. 31:; Moshe, in turn, similarly exhorts both people and Yehoshua in 31:7 and 23."
Joshua 3:26,"<b>to take care to observe:</b> Another phrase which echoes Deuteronomy (for example, in 31:6)."
Joshua 3:27,"<b>Record of the Instruction:</b> Heb. <i>sefer ha-tora</i>. It is not clear what is meant here; at this point in the Bible, the phrase does not refer to the Five Books of Moses, as it commonly does later. The word <i>sefer</i>, used to mean “book” in later centuries, in the Bible can cover all kinds of written documents. <b>recite:</b> Heb. <i>h-g-h</i> indicates a low murmur, in the oral style of ancient study (see also Ps. 1:2)."
Joshua 3:28,<b>be dismayed:</b> Or “be shattered.”
Joshua 3:29,"<b>three days:</b> The same period of preparation, known in Canaanite texts, preceded the meeting between God and Israel at Mount Sinai in Exod. 19. <b>take possession:</b> This verb (Heb. <i>y-r-sh</i>), which can sometimes mean “dispossess,” weaves throughout the book. In simplest form, it underlines “the juridical right to land by virtue of conquest” (Mitchell)."
Joshua 3:30,"<b>Re’uvenites … Gadites … half tribe of Menashe:</b> “Re’uven” (pronounced <i>re-oo-VANE</i>) is trad. English “Reuben,” while “Menashe” (pronounced <i>me-nah-SHEH</i>) is “Manasseh.” These three groups, back in Num. 32, had requested that they be permitted to settle on the east bank of the Jordan. There they agreed to participate with their fellow Israelites in the conquest of Canaan (on the West Bank)."
Joshua 3:31,"<b>the word:</b> Although the text reflects the gist of Num. 32, the words attributed to Moshe here do not appear verbatim in Numbers."
Joshua 3:32,"<b>wives … little-ones … livestock:</b> The usual components taken as the spoils of war; see Deut. 20:. “Little-ones,” Heb. <i>taf</i>, may also have the wider connotation of “stragglers,” thus including the infirm and the aged."
Joshua 3:33,<b>at the rising-place of the sun:</b> A common biblical idiom for “in/toward the east.”
Joshua 3:34,"<b>we will do:</b> Echoing, once again, the scene at Sinai in Exod. 19:8. Note the portrayal of Israel as a unified nation."
Joshua 3:35,"<b>your orders:</b> Literally, “your mouth.”"

One of the oldest cities in the world, it lies near the Dead Sea, with the surrounding hills rising several thousand feet toward the central plateau of Judah. <b>whore:</b> Traditional commentaries, following the Targum, have sought to soften this word, understanding it as “innkeeper,” but its usual meaning in the Bible is indeed “prostitute,” and that interpretation is more in keeping with the common motif of God working through less-than-heroic types (see Commentary). In the real world of the ancient Near East, as recorded in the much earlier Hammurabi Code, the location of an inn/brothel in a defensive wall was mentioned as a security risk (Weinfeld 993). <b>Rahav:</b> Pronounced <i>rah-HAV</i>); trad. English “Rahab.” The name resembles a verb that means “to widen.”"
Joshua 4:2,"<b>The king … was told:</b> Possibly by guards, who would be observing the traffic in and out of the city, or else by one of Rahav’s customers."

Joshua 4:5,<b>the men:</b> The king’s men. <b>they closed:</b> The townspeople.
Joshua 4:6,<b><i>she:</i></b> The emphasis points out her energy (Hawk 2000).
Joshua 4:7,"<b>dread of you:</b> Foreigners’ fear of the Israelites is a favorite motif in the Five Books of Moses; see, for example, Exod. 15:14–16."
Joshua 4:8,"<b>Amorite:</b> Used here to denote Israel’s neighbors east of the Jordan, but more often referring to the inhabitants of Canaan in general, or occasionally to those dwelling in the highlands. <b>Sihon … Og:</b> Pronounced <i>see-HONE</i> and <i>OG</i> (with “o” as in “old”). See Num. 21:21–35, where the Israelites encounter and defeat these two kings east of the Jordan. They are subsequently used as examples in narrating God’s great deeds on Israel’s behalf. <b>devoted-to-destruction:</b> This term (Hebrew root <i>h-r-m</i>), used frequently in Joshua, indicates people, animals, or objects set aside exclusively for God, often meaning wholesale destruction or death. Israel’s Moabite neighbors also spoke of <i>herem</i> in respect to their national god Kemosh, in the Mesha Stele (“Moabite Stone,” discovered in Jordan in 1868). The word appears in Arabic and has entered English as “harem,” signifying a group of women set apart for one man."

Joshua 4:11,"<b>in the wall she dwelt:</b> The location of Rahav’s house made it the perfect entry and escape spot for the spies. A casemate structure, featuring double walls (note the two different words for “wall” in the text) that allowed soldiers to be posted inside, was an architectural feature known to generations of Israelites in biblical times."
Joshua 4:12,"<b>We are clear:</b> Meaning, “We will be guiltless if you violate the terms of our agreement, and you’ll die like all the other inhabitants of Jericho.”"
Joshua 4:13,"<b>cord:</b> As Hawk (2000) notes, Heb. <i>tikva</i> also means “hope.” <b>scarlet thread:</b> Clearly noticeable from a distance, this is analogous to the blood marking the Israelites’ doors in the Exodus story. It is used elsewhere in purification rituals (see Lev. 14:4, 6, and Num. 19:6)."
Joshua 4:14,"<b>In accordance with your words, so be it!:</b> Her words seal the deal."
Joshua 4:15,"<b>Yehoshua son of Nun:</b> His full name had appeared in v.1, and thus brackets the whole story nicely (Meyers 2004).
The Crossing: Now comes the crucial moment of transition from one state of being (wandering) to another (conquest). Not surprisingly, the chapter contains a strong sense of boundaries, as if to foreshadow the entire second half of the book (Hess).
If we had any doubts as to Yehoshua’s leadership capabilities, they are dispelled by his Moshe-like act of splitting the waters of the Jordan—although Yehoshua himself does not stretch out a staff as Moshe and Aharon had done; this time, the act of cleaving the river is portrayed as coming directly from God. Only once will such a splitting of waters occur again, with Eliyyahu (Elijah) in II Kings 2. He too is presented as a kind of second Moshe, in acknowledgment of another great crisis in Israel’s history.
The motif of a religious object such as the Coffer (Ark) leading troops into battle is known all over the ancient and medieval world. Although the present chapter involves no fighting per se, it seems wholly appropriate that the Coffer, borne by priests, spearheads the long-awaited fording of the Jordan and thus inaugurates the conquest of Canaan.
Despite the dramatic moment in our text, the narrative is confusing at points. This has already been the case in previous accounts, such as the description of the revelation at Sinai (Exod. 19), and such confusion will also occur in Chaps. 4 and 6 below, as Nelson notes. This lack of clarity may stem from a complicated history of writing or transmitting the text, or from the desire to include all relevant traditions, no matter how inconsistent or contradictory.
Key words in the chapter include, not surprisingly, “cross” and “people,” with clusters of “carry,” “Coffer,” and “priests,” and “waters” and “stand.” In the end, the crossing of the Jordan, in contrast to the cosmic upheaval at the Sea of Reeds in Exodus, is orderly and hierarchical. Once again, ceremony and what it stands for—bonding the social unit together—trump historical reporting.
Those who seek a “scientific” explanation for the events of this chapter have noted the existence of clay riverbanks in the area, a soil composition that could lead to a temporary blockage (Rainey, following Aharoni). The text itself is wholly uninterested in such an approach."
Joshua 5:1,"Yehoshua started-early in the morning;
they marched on from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the Children of Israel,
and they spent the night there, before they crossed over."
Joshua 5:2,"Now it was at the end of three days
that the officials crossed into the midst of the camp"
Joshua 5:3,"and commanded the people, saying:
When you see the Coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small> your God
with the priests and the Levites carrying it,
you yourselves are to march on from your place
and walk behind it."
Joshua 5:4,"However—let it be far between you and it, about two thousand cubits in measure;
do not come near it,
in order that you may know the way that you are to go,
for you have not crossed that way yesterday [or] the day-before."
Joshua 5:5,"Yehoshua said to the people:
Make yourselves holy,
for tomorrow Y<small>HWH</small> will perform wonders in your midst!"
Joshua 5:6,"And Yehoshua said to the priests, saying:
Carry the Coffer of the Covenant
and cross over before the people!
So they carried the Coffer of the Covenant
and walked before the people."
Joshua 5:7,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Today I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel,
that they may know
that as I was with Moshe, I will be with you!

3:3 <b>Coffer of the Covenant:</b> Ancient Israel’s central cultic object, this chest (trad. English “Ark”) contained the tablets on which the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20) were written. See Exod. 25:1–22 for a full description. <b>the priests and the Levites:</b> Others, “the Levitical priests.” The term is problematic; given that it is hardly used in the subsequent books of the Early Prophets, it may indicate a southern (Jerusalem) writer’s bias against Levites (Boling 1982)."
Joshua 5:8,"<b>let it be far:</b> Proper distance from holy objects must be observed, lest one incur divine wrath. <b>two thousand cubits:</b> Biblical cubits measured from eighteen to twenty-two inches, so the distance in question would have been half a mile or more. <b>go:</b> Or “walk.” <b>yesterday [or] the day-before:</b> An idiom meaning “the past.”"
Joshua 5:9,"<b>Make yourselves holy:</b> That is, put yourselves in a state of ritual purity, by washing yourselves and abstaining from sexual relations. The same had been required of the people at Sinai (Exod. 19)."
Joshua 5:10,"<b>Carry … Coffer … Covenant:</b> The Hebrew is not alliterative.
Memorializing the Crossing: Here, as Nelson notes, recounting the act of “crossing” (once again a key word in the narrative) attains the identity-forming position suggested in the last chapter. In his words, the “act of retelling … would perform the function of reinforcing peoplehood.” The account of river fording described in the text is thus as much a rite of passage for Israelite audiences, as well as for Jewish and Christian ones of later periods, as it is a dramatic moment in the text itself. As typically laid out in Deuteronomy, historical events are prized mainly for their later meaning; here, all-important is the issue of children asking their parents, “What are these stones?” Only when we get to v.12 is there finally a mention of war. But even this does not overshadow the elevation of Yehoshua’s status as leader, despite the fact that no swords have yet been drawn and no arrows have yet flown.
In v.24 there is a reiteration of the verb “know,” which had been so meaningfully used in Chap. 2."
Joshua 5:11,"And you, command the priests, those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant, saying:
When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan,
in the Jordan you are to stand-still."
Joshua 5:12,"Yehoshua said to the Children of Israel:
Approach here and hearken to the words of Y<small>HWH</small> your God."
Joshua 5:13,"Then Yehoshua said:
By this you shall know
that the Living God is in your midst,
and that he will dispossess, yes, dispossess from before you
the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivvite,
the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Yevusite:"
Joshua 5:14,"here is the Coffer of the Covenant;
the Lord of All the Earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan!"
Joshua 5:15,"So-now, take yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel,
one man, one man [apiece] per tribe."
Joshua 5:16,"It will be, when the soles of the feet of the priests, those
carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>, the Lord of All the Earth, come to rest in the waters of the Jordan,
the waters of the Jordan will be cut off;
as for the waters coming down from above—
they will stand as one heap!"
Joshua 5:17,"So it was, at the people’s marching from their tents to cross the Jordan,
with the priests, those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant, before the people:"
Joshua 5:18,"that when those carrying the Coffer came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests, those carrying the Coffer, dipped in the edge of the water
—the Jordan being full to its banks, all the days of the harvest-cutting—"
Joshua 5:19,"the waters stood still, those coming down from above;
they rose as one heap, very far away, at Adam, the town that is beside Tzaretan,
while those going down to the Sea of the Plain, the Sea of Salt, were completely cut off,
and the people crossed over, opposite Jericho."
Joshua 5:20,"And the priests, those carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant, stood fast on dry-ground, in the middle of the Jordan,
while all Israel crossed over onto dry-ground,
until the entire nation had completed crossing over the Jordan."
Joshua 6:1,"Now it was, when the entire nation had completely crossed over the Jordan,
that Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua, saying:"
Joshua 6:2,"Take yourselves from the people twelve men: one man, one man [apiece] per tribe,"
Joshua 6:3,"and command them, saying:
Lift you up from here, from the middle of the Jordan, from the firmstanding-spot of the priests’ feet,
twelve stones;
have them cross over with you
and place them at the night-lodging where you will lodge tonight."
Joshua 6:4,"So Yehoshua called for twelve men whom he had confirmed, from the Children of Israel,
one man, one man [apiece] per tribe,"
Joshua 6:5,"and Yehoshua said to them:
Cross over before the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> your God, into the middle of the Jordan,
and raise yourselves, each one, a stone onto his shoulder,
corresponding to the number of tribes of the Children of Israel,"
Joshua 6:6,"in order that this may be a sign in your midst:
when your children ask you on the morrow, saying:
What are these stones to you?"
Joshua 6:7,"you are to say to them
that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Coffer of the Covenant of Y<small>HWH</small>;
when it crossed into the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.
And these stones are to be a reminder to the Children of Israel, into the ages!"
Joshua 6:8,"The Children of Israel did thus, as Yehoshua had commanded:
they lifted up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had spoken to Yehoshua,
corresponding to the number of tribes of the Children of Israel,
and had them cross over with them to the lodging-place, and deposited them there."
Joshua 6:9,"And the twelve stones Yehoshua erected in the middle of the Jordan, beneath the firmstanding-spot of the priests’ feet, those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant;
they are there until this day."
Joshua 6:10,"Now the priests, those carrying the Coffer, were standing fast in the middle of the Jordan,
until all the matter that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Yehoshua to speak to the people was completed,
exactly as Moshe had commanded Yehoshua;
the people went quickly, and they crossed over."
Joshua 6:11,"And it was, when all the people had completed crossing over,
that the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> and the priests crossed over before the people.

The Transition to Canaan: The saga of passage across the Jordan now comes to its completion. The river itself has been crossed, but the people are somehow not yet fully Israelite. To accomplish this, the text first recounts the circumcision of the new, non-slave generation of males, which in biblical terms must now slough off its desert persona and become “civilized” as Israelites. The other ethnic marker described in the chapter is the observance of Passover, not so much as a holiday that recalls the dramatic events of deliverance from Egypt, but as a primarily agricultural festival, tied inextricably to the land, with the noticeable substitution of the “yield of the land” for the manna that had sustained the people in the wilderness. Israel is thus initiated into its full identity at the very moment that it physically sets foot on the soil of Canaan. The pairing of circumcision and Passover had already occurred at a parallel moment in Exod. 12, as Fishbane notes; and Hamilton nicely observes that “it is vital at this point to demonstrate that Israel belongs to Yahweh and not to Egypt. They are not Pharaoh’s property.”
Finally, just as Moshe was addressed by God at the start of Israel’s earlier nation-becoming, Yehoshua encounters a divine messenger, at least briefly. The appearance of the mysterious figure, sword drawn in hand, recalls the victorious divine stance often portrayed in ancient Near Eastern iconography. At this point, the path to war has been properly paved. A people and its leader are ready.
In sum, the conquest reiterates the “prototype” of earlier days, as “the great paradigms of the past are renewed for future generations” (Fishbane). This statement could apply to the entire four-book collection that has come down to us as the Early Prophets."
Joshua 6:21,"And the Children of Re’uven, the Children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menashe crossed over, armed, before the Children of Israel,
as Moshe had spoken to them;"
Joshua 6:22,"about forty units of specially-drafted [men] from the armed-forces crossed over in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> to battle,
to the Plains of Jericho."
Joshua 6:23,"On that day Y<small>HWH</small> made Yehoshua great in the eyes of all Israel;
they held him in awe, just as they had held Moshe in awe,
all the days of his life."
Joshua 6:24,"Then Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua, saying:"
Joshua 6:25,"Command the priests, those carrying the Coffer of the Testimony,
that they should come up from the Jordan."
Joshua 6:26,"So Yehoshua commanded the priests, saying:
Come up from the Jordan!"
Joshua 6:27,"And it was, upon the coming up of the priests, those carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant, from the middle of the Jordan,
—the soles of the priests’ feet were drawn up onto the dry-ground—
that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place
and went on as yesterday [and] the day-before, to all their banks."
Joshua 6:28,"Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month,
and encamped at Gilgal/Circle, at the sunrise edge of Jericho."
Joshua 6:29,"And these twelve stones that they had taken from the Jordan, Yehoshua erected at Gilgal."
Joshua 6:30,"He said to the Children of Israel, saying:
When your children ask their fathers on the morrow, saying:
What are these stones?"
Joshua 6:31,"You are to make known to your children, saying:
On dry-land did Israel cross this Jordan,"
Joshua 6:32,"when Y<small>HWH</small> your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until your crossing over,
just as Y<small>HWH</small> your God had done at the Sea of Reeds, which he dried up before us, until our crossing over—"
Joshua 6:33,"in order that all the peoples of the earth might have knowledge of the hand of Y<small>HWH</small>, how strong it is,
in order that you might hold Y<small>HWH</small> your God in awe, all the days [to come],"
Joshua 7:1,"Now it was, when they heard—all the Amorite kings who were across the Jordan seaward,
and all the Canaanite kings who were by the Sea,
that Y<small>HWH</small> had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Children of Israel, until they had crossed over,
their heart melted [in fear],
and they were left breathless before the Children of Israel."
Joshua 7:2,"At that time, Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Make yourself knives of flint
and again circumcise the Children of Israel, a second time."
Joshua 7:3,"So Yehoshua made himself knives of flint
and circumcised the Children of Israel, at the Hill of Foreskins."
Joshua 7:4,"And this is the matter concerning which Yehoshua circumcised them:
all the people coming out of Egypt, the males, all the men of battle,
had died in the wilderness, on the way,
upon their going out of Egypt."
Joshua 7:5,"For they had been circumcised, all the people who had gone out,
while all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way, upon their going out of Egypt, had not been circumcised."
Joshua 7:6,"For the Children of Israel had traveled forty years in the wilderness,
until the entire nation was gone, the men of battle, who had come out of Egypt,
who had not hearkened to the voice of Y<small>HWH</small>,
those to whom Y<small>HWH</small> swore that he would not let them see the land
that Y<small>HWH</small> had sworn to their fathers to give them,
a land flowing with milk and honey."
Joshua 7:7,"But their children whom he had raised up in their place,
<i>them</i> Yehoshua circumcised, for they were foreskinned,
since they had not been circumcised on the way."
Joshua 7:8,"Now it was, when the entire nation was done being circumcised,
that they stayed in their place in the camp, until their recovery."
Joshua 7:9,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Today I have rolled the disgrace of Egypt from off you!
So the name of that place has been called Gilgal/Rolling, until this day."
Joshua 7:10,"The Children of Israel encamped at Gilgal,
and they performed the Passover offering on the fourteenth day of the month, at sunset,
in the Plains of Jericho."
Joshua 7:11,"They ate from the yield of the land on the morrow of Passover: unleavened cakes and parched grain,
on this very day."
Joshua 7:12,"And the <i>mahn</i> ceased on the morrow, when they ate the yield of the land;
there was no more <i>mahn</i> for the Children of Israel,
and they ate from the produce of the land of Canaan in that year."
Joshua 7:13,"Now it was, when Yehoshua was at Jericho,
that he lifted up his eyes and saw:
now here, a man standing opposite him,
with his sword drawn in his hand!
Yehoshua went toward him and said to him:
Are you for us or for our foes?"
Joshua 7:14,"He said: No,
rather, I am the commander of Y<small>HWH</small>’s forces.
Now I have come!
Yehoshua flung himself on his face to the ground and bowed low,
and said to him:
What does my lord have to speak to his servant?"
Joshua 7:15,"The commander of Y<small>HWH</small>’s forces said to Yehoshua:
Put off your sandal from your foot,
for the place on which you are standing—it is holy!
And Yehoshua did thus.

Joshua 7:17,"<b>units:</b> Agreeing with a number of scholars, Boling (1982) included, who understand the word <i>elef</i> as a military “contingent,” thus reducing the numbers drastically in these stories. The same reduction may be true for the Torah’s enumeration of those who left Egypt, which at first blush indicates over six hundred thousand warriors. <b>specially-drafted:</b> Possibly, selected (Heb. <i>h-l-tz</i>, “removed”) from among the normal soldiers."
Joshua 7:18,<b>Testimony:</b> Another word for the covenant.
Joshua 7:19,"<b>on the tenth:</b> This seems to be an intentional allusion to the fact that the Israelites in Exodus had been commanded to take a lamb on the tenth day of the same month, in celebrating the first Passover (Fishbane). <b>the first month:</b> Corresponding to March or April. <b>Gilgal:</b> Likely located not far from Jericho (although a number of biblical towns have the same name), this was an important cultic center in early biblical times."
Joshua 7:20,"<b>hold … in awe:</b> Trad. “fear.” Boling (1982) posits a more political meaning to the phrase: “give allegiance.” See v.14 above.
5:2 <b>knives:</b> The Hebrew word usually means “swords.” Flint may be used here because of its primitive, i.e., nontechnological, associations. It may be more precisely identified as obsidian, a stone known for smoothness and sharpness (Hess). <b>a second time:</b> Meaning the new generation, as explained in the subsequent verses."
Joshua 7:21,<b>matter:</b> JPS (following Kimhi): “reason.”
Joshua 7:22,"<b>them:</b> So several manuscripts; MT (the standard Hebrew text) reads “us.” <b>flowing with milk and honey:</b> The land’s richness is so described for the first time in Exod. 3:8. The milk is likely that of goats; while it was long considered that the “honey” referred to the syrup of dates, recent discoveries point to some domestication of bees in ancient Israel. In Canaanite poetry, the parallel phrase is “fatness and honey.”"
Joshua 7:23,"<b>recovery:</b> Lit., “living [again],” “reviving.”"
Joshua 7:24,"<b>the disgrace of Egypt:</b> Usually understood as the stigma of slavery; Hess sees it as symbolizing the disobedience of the slave generation.

Joshua 7:26,"<b><i>mahn:</i></b> The miraculous food sent by God in Exod. 16:14, which sustained the Israelites in the wilderness. Trad. English “manna.”"
Joshua 7:27,<b>at:</b> Or “by.”
Joshua 7:28,"<b>No:</b> Boling (1982) understands the Hebrew as “Neither one.” Another possibility is “[He said] to him,” as Heb. <i>lo’</i> and <i>lo</i> are homonyms. <b>bowed low:</b> Here, as often, biblical characters prostrate themselves “nostrils to the ground.”"
Joshua 7:29,"<b>Put off your sandal … holy:</b> Echoing God’s words to Moshe at the burning bush (Exod. 3:5).
The Fall of Jericho: The first military action recorded in the book of Joshua is also the most memorable. While a historian of warfare might remark on the strategic genius of the siege of Jericho—troops silently marching around a city for six days might well be completely unnerving and demoralizing to its captive population—tactics and psychology are probably not the point of the narrative. Once again we have what looks like a ritual procession, almost as if an audience, by being receptive to the story, is experiencing the events as part of a communal festival of some sort (and Hawk 2000 notes the use of both shofar and shouting, integral to the story, in other biblical ritual contexts). In addition, there is a magical element, given that many ancient and later stories speak of a taking-possession by means of drawing a circle. In the present context, these devices, including the famous blowing of the shofars, have the effect of moving the credit for the victory away from the armies and squarely toward God. The way is cleared for the Israelite troops, and the actual conquest is easily accomplished.
The vocabulary of the chapter naturally centers around circling, sounding blasts on the <i>shofars</i>, and shouting; at the same time, a major theme in the book, that of “devoting-to-destruction,” a holy war concept, makes its first pointed appearance here. Notably, the Coffer also makes its last appearance (Auld 1998), suggesting once again that the present version of the story is ritually based.
Nelson points out that vv.18–19 foreshadow the next story, about Akhan, in their use of “desire,” “silver and gold,” and “disaster.” But as Chap. 4 did, this one chapter at least ends with a notice about Yehoshua’s greatness."
Joshua 8:1,"Now Jericho closed up and was closed-up-tight before the Children of Israel;
no one went out and no one came in."
Joshua 8:2,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
See, I have given into your hand
Jericho and her king, [and] the mighty-men of valor."
Joshua 8:3,"You are to go around the city, all the men of battle,
circling the city one time;
thus you are to do for six days,"
Joshua 8:4,"while seven priests are to carry seven <i>shofars</i> of rams ahead of the Coffer.
But on the seventh day, you are to go around the city seven times,
while the priests sound blasts on the <i>shofars</i>."
Joshua 8:5,"And it shall be, at the drawing out of the ram’s horn:
when you hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i>,
that all the fighting-people are to shout a great shout,
and the wall of the city will fall down from below;
then the fighting-people are to go up, each one [straight] in front of him!"
Joshua 8:6,"Yehoshua son of Nun called for the priests
and said to them:
Carry the Coffer of the Covenant,
while seven priests carry seven <i>shofars</i> of rams ahead of the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Joshua 8:7,"And he said to the fighting-people:
Cross over and go around the city;
as for the vanguard, it shall cross over ahead of the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Joshua 8:8,"And it was, as soon as Yehoshua talked to the fighting-people,
with the seven priests carrying the seven <i>shofars of</i> rams in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
that they crossed over
and sounded blasts on the <i>shofars</i>,
with the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant going after them."
Joshua 8:9,"Now the vanguard was going ahead of the priests, those sounding blasts [on] the <i>shofars</i>,
while the gathering-up [unit] was going after the Coffer, going and sounding blasts on the <i>shofars</i>."
Joshua 8:10,"As for the fighting-people, Yehoshua commanded them, saying:
You are not to shout, you are not to make your voice heard,
not a word is to go out of your mouth
until the time of my saying to you: Shout!
Then you are to shout."
Joshua 8:11,"He had the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small> go around the city,
circling one time;
then they came back to the camp
and spent the night in the camp."
Joshua 8:12,"Yehoshua started early in the morning,
and the priests carried up the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>,"
Joshua 8:13,"while the seven priests carrying the seven <i>shofars</i> of rams ahead of the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>

with the vanguard going ahead of them
and with the gathering-up [unit] going ahead of the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>,
going along and sounding blasts on the <i>shofars</i>."
Joshua 8:14,"They went around the city on the second day, one time,
and then they returned to the camp.
Thus they did for six days."
Joshua 8:15,"Now it was, on the seventh day,
that they started early, at the coming up of dawn;
they went around the city in this manner seven times—
only on this day did they go around the city seven times."
Joshua 8:16,"And it was, at the seventh time,
that the priests sounded blasts on the <i>shofars</i>,
and Yehoshua said to the fighting-people:
Shout!
For Y<small>HWH</small> has given you the city!"
Joshua 8:17,"The city will be devoted-to-destruction,
it and all who are in it, for Y<small>HWH</small>;
only Rahav the whore shall live,
she and all who are with her in the house,
for she hid the messengers whom we sent."
Joshua 8:18,"And you, only be careful regarding the devoted-things,
lest you feel desire and take from the devoted-things
and render the camp of Israel devoted-to-destruction,
and bring disaster upon it."
Joshua 8:19,"For all silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron—
they are holy to Y<small>HWH</small>;
into the treasury of Y<small>HWH</small> they are to come!"
Joshua 8:20,"So the fighting-people shouted and sounded blasts on the <i>shofars;</i>
and it was, at the people’s hearing the <i>shofar</i> sound,
that the people shouted a great shout,
and the wall fell down from below,
and the people went up to the city, each one [straight] in front of him,
and captured the city."
Joshua 8:21,"And they devoted-to-destruction everyone who was in the city,
from man to woman, from young lad to old man,
to ox and sheep and donkey,
with the mouth of the sword."
Joshua 8:22,"But to the two men, those spying out the land, Yehoshua said:
Go to the house of the whore woman
and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her,
as you swore to her.

Breaking Faith; The Valley of Disaster: All has gone well so far. The Israelites, led by a pious and faithful general, have crossed the boundary into the Promised Land, secured the memory of the event for future generations, and recovered and renewed some of the most significant and symbolic ritual practices of their ancestors. Crowning this sequence, they have witnessed and participated in the miraculous destruction of an ancient and heavily fortified city. Now, however, disaster strikes, not for lack of effort or strategy, but for one reason only: the committing of sacrilege against God. One of the troops that took Jericho is unable to suppress the common soldier’s craving for plunder and tries to conceal his theft. The seriousness of the offense is indicated by the repeated use of the verb “take,” which will later (I Sam. 8) be highlighted in the text’s warning about the perils of kingship. Interestingly, the perpetrator Akhan stems from Yehuda (Judah), the southern tribe and region so often preferred in The Early Prophets. This might further support a northern authorship for the story.
The drama of the narrative is heightened by the drawing of lots, with the confession coming only after their “capture,” as Hebrew usage has it. Akhan’s fate is execution by stoning, and, as in the case of Korah in Num. 16, includes all of his family and possessions. This serves to emphasize the seriousness of violating the rule of <i>herem</i>, plunder which is to be set aside (“devoted”) for God. In general it reinforces the book’s concept that ownership, of land as well as of movable goods, is ultimately God’s. To forget this is to incur a wrath so great that it results in unexpected military defeat, and thus the episode is a helpful reminder in the text that the conquest is a privilege, not a foregone conclusion."
Joshua 9:10,"So the lads, the spies, went

Joshua 10:2,"Meanwhile, Yehoshua sent men from Jericho to Ai/The Ruin, which is beside Bet-Aven, east of Bet-El,
and said to them, saying:
Go up and spy out the land.

Joshua 10:3,"then they returned to Yehoshua and said to him:
Not all the fighting-people need go up.
Let about two thousand men or three thousand men go up and strike Ai—
do not exhaust all the fighting-people there, for they are few."
Joshua 10:4,"So there went up there, from the fighting-people, about three thousand men,
but they fled from before the men of Ai:"
Joshua 10:5,"the men of Ai struck down of them about thirty-six men

The Conquest of Ai: This is the longest battle scene in the book. It mostly concerns the strategy of ambush and its execution; but significantly, the chapter ends (vv.30–35) with a covenant scene in which the divine “Instruction” is renewed in the manner prescribed by Moshe (see Deut. 27). Thus, despite the long description of strategy, which is of great interest to future military minds, and the geographically accurate details of the story, the chapter is really about the resolution of the Akhan debacle and the return to the original state of affairs in which God protects the Israelites in battle. To underscore this, in vv.8 and 27 the Israelites are first commanded to and then described as hearkening to “the word of YHWH”; in v.35, the assembled nation hears the word of Moshe read aloud (Nelson). Thus it is confirmed that the successful battle plan derives not from the general himself, but from the divine word. From now on, there will be no more question about how to defeat the Israelites, and in the very next chapter, a group of fearful Canaanites will have to resort to a ruse in order to simply survive.
Vv.30–35 read like an interruption in the war account, but they seem to have been placed here to reestablish the distinctive relationship between Israel and Y<small>HWH</small>, which had been ruptured. In that sense, this little story is reminiscent of the regiving of the divine tablets in Exod. 34, which occurs after a parallel breach of the covenant. It is also an example of the book of Joshua faithfully carrying out Mosaic law, in this case the requirement of renewing the covenant as set forth in Deut. 27. Indeed, the language in vv.30–35 is constructed from phrases in Deuteronomy (Rösel).
It has often been noted that Ai, “the Ruin,” was almost certainly not inhabited in the time of Yehoshua and that it was perhaps the very ruins that became entwined in popular imagination with the events recorded in our chapters."
Joshua 11:12,"And it shall be: the one captured-by-lot regarding the devoted-things is to be burned with fire,
he and all who belong to him,
because he crossed the covenant of Y<small>HWH</small>,
because he did a vile-thing in Israel!"
Joshua 11:13,"So Yehoshua started early in the morning;
he brought Israel near, by their tribes,
and the tribe of Judah was captured-by-lot."
Joshua 11:14,"He brought near the clans of Judah,
and the Zarhite clan was captured;
he brought near the Zarhite clans, by the males, and Zavdi was captured;"
Joshua 11:15,"he brought near his house, by the males,
and Akhan son of Carmi son of Zavdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was captured."
Joshua 11:16,"Yehoshua said to Akhan:
My son, now give glory to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
and make confession to him;
now tell me: What have you done?
Do not conceal it from me!"
Joshua 11:17,"Akhan answered Yehoshua and said:
In truth, I did sin against Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel;
like this and like that I did:"
Joshua 11:18,"I saw among the spoils a goodly Shin’ar mantle, and two hundred weights of silver,
and an ingot of gold, fifty weights its weight;
I desired them and I took them—
and here they are, hidden in the ground, within my tent, along with the silver beneath it."
Joshua 11:19,"Yehoshua sent messengers;
they ran to the tent,
and here, [it was] hidden in his tent, with the silver beneath it!"
Joshua 11:20,"They took them from amid the tent and brought them to Yehoshua and to all the Children of Israel,
and they emptied them out in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Joshua 11:21,"Then Yehoshua took Akhan son of Zerah
and the silver, and the mantle, and the ingot of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his ox, and his donkey, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that belonged to him,
—all Israel was with him—
and they brought them up to the Valley of Akhor/Disaster."
Joshua 11:22,"Yehoshua said:
How you have brought-disaster-on us!
Y<small>HWH</small> will bring-disaster-on you this day!
And all Israel pelted him with stones;
they burned them with fire
and stone-heaped them with stones,"
Joshua 11:23,"and erected over him a large mound of stones, until this day.
So Y<small>HWH</small> turned back from his flaming anger.
Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Disaster, until this day."
Joshua 12:1,"Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Do not be frightened, do not be dismayed;
take all the people of battle with you
and arise, go up to Ai.
See: I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land!"
Joshua 12:2,"You are to do to Ai and to its king
as you did to Jericho and to its king;
only its spoils and its animals may you plunder for yourselves.
Set yourself an ambush for the city, behind it."
Joshua 12:3,"So Yehoshua arose, along with all the people of battle, to go up against Ai.
And Yehoshua chose thirty thousand men, mighty-men of valor,
and sent them off at night;"
Joshua 12:4,"he charged them, saying:
See: you are setting an ambush for the city, behind the city;
do not go exceedingly far from the city,
but all of you be ready."
Joshua 12:5,"As for me and all the fighting-people who are with me,
we will come near to the city,
and it shall be:
when they come out to meet us, as at the beginning,
we will flee before them."
Joshua 12:6,"But when they come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city,
—for they will think: They are fleeing before us as at the beginning!
and we flee before them—"
Joshua 12:7,"then <i>you</i> are to arise from the ambush
and take possession of the city;
Y<small>HWH</small> your God will give it into your hand!"
Joshua 12:8,"And it will be, when you seize the city,
that you are to ignite the city with fire;
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> you are to do.
See: I have charged you!"
Joshua 12:9,"Yehoshua sent them off, and they went to the [place of] ambush
and stayed between Bet-El and Ai, seaward from Ai,
and Yehoshua spent the night on that night amid the fighting-people."
Joshua 12:10,"Yehoshua started early in the morning and mustered the fighting-people;
then he went up, he and the elders of Israel, ahead of the fighting-people to Ai,"
Joshua 12:11,"while all the people for battle who were with him went up and approached, coming opposite the city,
and encamped north of Ai,
with a ravine between them and Ai."
Joshua 12:12,"He took about five thousand men
and set them in ambush between Bet-El and Ai, seaward of the city,"
Joshua 12:13,"while the fighting-people set up the entire camp that was north of the city,
as well as its rearguard, seaward of the city.
And Yehoshua lodged that night in the middle of the valley."
Joshua 12:14,"Now it was, when the king of Ai saw,
that they went quickly and started-early, and the men of the city came out to meet Israel in battle,
he and all his fighting-people, to the appointed place in front of the plain
—but he did not know that there was an ambush for him behind the city."
Joshua 12:15,"And Yehoshua and all the fighting-people acted as if beaten before them;
they fled by way of the wilderness."
Joshua 12:16,"Then all the fighting-people who were in the city were summoned to pursue after them,
and they pursued after Yehoshua and let themselves be torn away from the city,"
Joshua 12:17,"so that not a man remained in Ai or in Bet-El who had not gone out after Israel;
they left the city open
and pursued after Israel."
Joshua 12:18,"Then Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Stretch out the scimitar that is in your hand toward Ai,
for into your hand I give it!
So Yehoshua stretched out the scimitar that was in his hand toward the city,"
Joshua 12:19,"and the ambush quickly arose from its place
and ran, at the stretching out of his hand;
they came to the city and captured it,
and quickly ignited the city with fire."
Joshua 12:20,"The men of Ai faced about behind them and saw:
now here, the smoke of the city went up to the heavens!
But they had no [place] at hand to flee to here or to there.
And the fighting-people who had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers."
Joshua 12:21,"Now Yehoshua and all Israel saw
that the ambush had taken the city,
and that the smoke of the city was going up,
so they returned and struck down the men of Ai."
Joshua 12:22,"These went out of the city to meet them,
and they were, regarding Israel, in the middle: these were on this-side and those were on that-side,
and they struck them down
until they left them no survivor or fugitive."
Joshua 12:23,"As for the king of Ai, they seized [him] alive
and brought him near to Yehoshua."
Joshua 12:24,"Now it was, when Israel had finished killing all of the settled-folk of Ai, in the open-field and in the wilderness where they had pursued them,
—all of them fell by the mouth of the sword, until they were gone—
that all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the mouth of the sword."
Joshua 12:25,"And all those falling on that day, from man to woman,
were twelve thousand, all the inhabitants of Ai."
Joshua 12:26,"Now Yehoshua did not turn back his hand with which he had stretched out the scimitar
until he had devoted-to-destruction all the settled-folk of Ai."
Joshua 12:27,"Only the animals and the spoils of that city did Israel plunder for themselves,
in accordance with the word of Y<small>HWH</small> which he had commanded Yehoshua.

The Unexpected Treaty: After the long and detailed battle narrative of the previous chapter, this text provides a colorful break. It also serves to demonstrate how the Israelites have returned to following God’s commands. The Giv’onites fulfill the legal role of a city that surrenders in Deut. 20; as a result, they are not destroyed by the invaders but become subject to forced labor.
The text opens with a deception occasioned by fear, just as Rahav in Chap. 2 had begun the account of the Jericho campaign with an acknowledgment of God’s power. It is also the classic treatment of a recurring theme in Joshua and Judges: the conquest was not quite complete.
A key word in the chapter is “far,” an ironic usage here. Giv’on was in fact close to Jerusalem, and also not a great distance from what the text represents as the recently destroyed Ai. More significant is the location of the region on major trade routes to the Mediterranean coast. No wonder that in the next chapter, Jerusalem spearheads a coalition to attack Giv’on (Rainey/Notley).
The scenario of a terror-stricken group surrendering as slaves to an invader rather than being slaughtered has many ancient Near Eastern parallels. In those cases, the purpose of the account seems to be to boost the fame of the conquering king (Younger)."
Joshua 13:14,"And Yehoshua burned down Ai;
he made it into an everlasting mound, a wasteland, until this day."
Joshua 13:15,"As for the king of Ai, he hung him on a wooden-stake, until the time of sunset,
and when the sun came in, Yehoshua commanded that they take his corpse down from the stake,
and they threw it by the entrance to the city gate
and erected over it a large mound of stones, until this day."
Joshua 13:16,"Then Yehoshua built a sacrificial-altar to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, on Mount Eval,"
Joshua 13:17,"as Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had commanded the Children of Israel,
as is written in the Record of the Instruction of Moshe,
an altar of complete stones, upon which no iron had been raised,
and they sent up upon it offerings-up to Y<small>HWH</small>,
and sacrificed <i>shalom</i>-offerings."
Joshua 13:18,"And he wrote there upon the stones
a copy of the Instruction of Moshe,
which he had written before the Children of Israel."
Joshua 13:19,"Now all Israel and its elders and its officials and its judges were standing on this-side and on that-side,
by the Coffer, opposite the Levitical priests, those carrying the Coffer of Y<small>HWH</small>’s Covenant:
as the sojourner, so the citizen,
half of them opposite Mount Gerizim and half of them opposite Mount Eval,
as Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had commanded [them] to bless the people of Israel at the beginning."
Joshua 13:20,"After that, he read aloud all the words of the Instruction, the blessing and the curse,
exactly as was written in the Record of the Instruction."
Joshua 13:21,"There was not a word from all that Moshe had commanded
that Yehoshua did not read aloud opposite the entire assembly of Israel,
and the women, and the little-ones, and the sojourner who was going in their midst."
Joshua 14:1,"Now it was, when all the kings who were across the Jordan heard
—in the highlands and in the lowlands, and on all the shore of the Great Sea, opposite the Levanon,
the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivvites, and the Yevusites—,"
Joshua 14:2,"that they gathered together to do battle with Yehoshua and with Israel, [under] one command."
Joshua 14:3,"But the settled-folk of Giv’on heard about what Yehoshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,"
Joshua 14:4,"so they acted, for their part, with cunning, and went and supplied themselves:
they took worn-out sacks on their donkeys,
and worn-out wineskins, split and sewn up,"
Joshua 14:5,"with worn-out and patched sandals on their feet,
and worn-out clothes upon themselves,
while all the bread of their supplies was dry [and] had become crumbs."
Joshua 14:6,"And they went to Yehoshua, to the camp at Gilgal,
and said to him and to the men of Israel:
From a far-off land we have come;
so-now, cut a covenant with us!"
Joshua 14:7,"The men of Israel said to the Hivvites:
Perhaps you are settled in my midst,
so how can I cut a covenant with you?"
Joshua 14:8,"They said to Yehoshua:
We are your servants!
Yehoshua said to them:
Who are you, and from where have you come?"
Joshua 14:9,"They said to him:
From a land exceedingly far off your servants have come,
because of the fame of Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
for we have heard the heard-report of him
and of all that he did in Egypt,"
Joshua 14:10,"and of all that he did to the two Amorite kings who were across the Jordan,
to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtarot."
Joshua 14:11,"So our elders and all the settled-folk of our land said to us, saying:
Take in your hand supplies for the way,
and go meet them
and say to them:
We are your servants.
So-now, cut a covenant with us!"
Joshua 14:12,"This our bread—[while it was] warm, we supplied ourselves with it, from our houses,
on the day of our setting out to go to you,
but now, here, it is dry [and] has become crumbs!"
Joshua 14:13,"And these wineskins that we filled new:
here, they have split open;
and these our clothes and our sandals have worn out
from this very great journey"
Joshua 14:14,"The men took from their supplies, but did not inquire of Y<small>HWH</small>’s mouth.

Joshua 14:15,"<b>an everlasting mound:</b> Like Jericho, Ai was not to be rebuilt. “Mound” implies a ruined heap."
Joshua 14:16,"<b>hung him on a wooden-stake:</b> This practice, possibly impalement, would take place after the actual killing, and was intended to further humiliate the victim. <b>until … sunset:</b> In accordance with the law in Deut. 21:23, a criminal’s body was not to be left out overnight."
Joshua 14:17,"<b>Then:</b> or “This was when” (Rösel). <b>Mount Eval:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-VAHL;</i> trad. English “Ebal,” the northern of the two large hills which overlook the city of Shekhem (modern Nablus). The other was Mount Gerizim, mentioned in v.33 below."
Joshua 14:18,"<b>complete:</b> Unhewn, not cut by metal. <b>no iron:</b> Continuing the traditional avoidance of iron. <b><i>shalom</i>-offerings:</b> Scholars disagree about the meaning of Heb. <i>shelamim</i>.

I have kept <i>shalom</i> (peace, greeting, wholeness), to leave all of these possibilities open."

Joshua 15:5,"<b>cut a covenant:</b> See Gen. 15:10 for a memorable example of taking the verb literally. In a practice that is attested in the Aramaic Sefire treaty, the parties to such an agreement would walk between cut-up animals, implying a similar fate if one of them were to break the agreement in the future."
Joshua 15:6,"<b>how can I cut … :</b> Given the command to annihilate the locals (Deut. :1–2), such a treaty would be impermissible."
Joshua 15:7,<b>We are:</b> Or “we will be.”

Joshua 15:9,"<b>The men:</b> The Israelites. <b>took from their supplies:</b> There are several possibilities here. Boling (1982) suggests the context of a covenant meal; JPS reads “took [their word] because of their provisions.” <b>did not inquire:</b> Did not consult an oracle.
The Defense of Giv’on; Southern Victories: The peace treaty concluded in the last chapter provokes a strong reaction from the neighboring “kingdoms” (actually city-states). Just as Israel seeks to obliterate the Canaanites, the latter will have no truck with those who attempt to make peace with them. In a war reminiscent of another wide-ranging one in Gen. 14 (“the four kings against the five”), in which Avraham had intervened as warrior, Yehoshua engages the coalition led by the ruler of Jerusalem and defeats them with, of course, the help of God. This time the divine intervention is more directly miraculous. As the stars will later be said to fight on the Israelites’ behalf in Judg. 5:20, so God hurls hailstones down upon the hapless enemy here. Also connected to this event in the final form of our text, though perhaps not originally, is the memorable fragment about the sun and the moon “standing still” for Yehoshua. As Nelson notes, the verb may actually indicate something else (such as “remaining dark” or “being silent”), but in any case, Yehoshua is once again magnified as army commander, one who can enlist even the forces of nature in the cause of victory.
The fate of the vanquished kings in vv.16–28 serves to set the tone for the conquest to follow. By focusing on such details at the beginning of the sequence of conquest, we are not left in any doubt as to the eventual outcome. Thus the passage functions, once again, as a literary rather than as an annalistic introduction.
After v.28, the text proceeds with the blow-by-blow campaign of conquest, with this chapter focusing on the south and thus once again pointing to the eventual primacy of Yehuda. At long last, the book begins to resemble other conquest accounts from the ancient Near East, using a stock vocabulary for each paragraph and town conquered (“battle,” “strike [down],” “capture,” “sword,” “devote-to-destruction,” and “he left no survivor”). As Hess points out, from Chap. 10 on, the conquest will proceed at an ever-quickening pace, heightening the drama.
Notable from this point through 12:1 are multiple occurrences of the word “all”—some forty-five of them, according to Hawk’s (2000) count. He rightly takes this as a sign of “Israelite integrity, comprehensive conquest, and obedience to Y<small>HWH</small> and the commands of Moses.” I have been unable to reproduce the repetition without undue violence to English; the reader will have to be content with noting “all” and “every [person].”"
Joshua 15:10,"And Yehoshua made peace with them:
he cut a covenant with them, letting them live,
and the exalted-leaders of the community swore [an oath] to them."
Joshua 15:11,"But it was, at the end of three days after they had cut a covenant with them,
that they heard that they [dwelt] near to them,
and that it was in their midst that they were settled!"
Joshua 15:12,"So the Children of Israel marched out and came to their towns on the third day
—now their towns were Giv’on and Kefira and Be’erot and Kiryat-Ye’arim."
Joshua 15:13,"But the Children of Israel did not strike them down, since the leaders of the community had sworn to them by Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
so the entire community grumbled against the leaders."
Joshua 15:14,"And all the leaders said to the entire community:
We ourselves swore to them by Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel,
so now we are not able to harm them!"
Joshua 15:15,"This [is how] we must act toward them:
let them live,
that there not be fury against us regarding the sworn-oath that we swore to them!"
Joshua 15:16,"And the leaders said to them:
They may live.
So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the entire community,
as the leaders had spoken concerning them."
Joshua 15:17,"But Yehoshua called for them and spoke to them, saying:
Why did you deceive us, saying:
We are exceedingly far from you,
when you are settled in our midst?"
Joshua 15:18,"So-now, doomed are you:
never shall a servant be cut off from you
either as hewers of wood or drawers of water for the house of my God!"
Joshua 15:19,"They answered Yehoshua and said:
It was because it was told, yes, told to your servants
that Y<small>HWH</small> your God had commanded Moshe his servant
to give you all the land
and to wipe out all the settled-folk of the land before you—
so we were very afraid for our lives before you,
and we did this thing."
Joshua 15:20,"But now, here we are in your hand;
as is good, as is right in your eyes to do with us, do."
Joshua 15:21,"So he did thus with them:
he rescued them from the hand of the Children of Israel, so that they did not kill them,"
Joshua 15:22,"but Yehoshua made them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the community,
and for the sacrificial-altar of Y<small>HWH</small>, until this day,
at the place that he chooses."
Joshua 16:1,"Now it was, when Adoni-Tzedek, king of Jerusalem, heard
that Yehoshua had captured Ai, and had devoted-it-to-destruction,
—as he had done to Jericho and to its king, so he had done to Ai and to its king—
and that the settled-folk of Giv’on had made peace with Israel
and were remaining in their midst,"
Joshua 16:2,"he was exceedingly afraid,
for Giv’on was a large city, like one of the royal cities
—indeed, it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty ones."
Joshua 16:3,"So Adoni-Tzedek king of Jerusalem sent [word]
to Hoham king of Hevron, and to Pir’am king of Yarmut, and to Yafia king of Lakhish, and to Devir king of Eglon, saying:"
Joshua 16:4,"Come up to me and help me,
that we may strike Giv’on,
for they have made peace with Yehoshua and with the Children of Israel!"
Joshua 16:5,"They gathered together and went up, the five Amorite kings—
the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hevron, the king of Yarmut, the king of Lakhish, and the king of Eglon,
they and all their camps,
and they encamped against Giv’on, and did battle with it."
Joshua 16:6,"The men of Giv’on sent [word] to Yehoshua, to the camp at Gilgal, saying:
Do not let your hand slacken from your servants;
come up to us quickly
and deliver us, help us,
for all the kings of the Amorites, the settled-folk of the highlands, have gathered against us!"
Joshua 16:7,"So Yehoshua went up from Gilgal,
he and all the people of battle with him,
and all the mighty-men of valor."
Joshua 16:8,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Do not be afraid of them,
for into your hand I have given them;
no man among them will be able to stand up before you!"
Joshua 16:9,"Yehoshua came against them, suddenly,
having gone up all night from Gilgal."
Joshua 16:10,"And Y<small>HWH</small> panicked them before Israel,
so that they struck them, a great striking-down, at Giv’on,
and pursued them by way of the Bet-Horon Pass;
they struck at them as far as Azeka and as far as Makkeda."
Joshua 16:11,"Now it was, when they were fleeing before Israel,
—they were at the descent of Bet-Horon—
that Y<small>HWH</small> threw down upon them large stones from the heavens, as far as Azeka, and they died;
[there were] more who died by the stones
than those whom the Children of Israel killed with the sword."
Joshua 16:12,"Then Yehoshua spoke to Y<small>HWH</small>
on the day of Y<small>HWH</small>’s giving the Amorites before the Children of Israel;
he said before the eyes of Israel:
O sun, at Giv’on be still,
O moon, in the Valley of Ayyalon!"
Joshua 16:13,"So the sun was still, and the moon stood fast,
until a nation was avenged on its enemies.
—Is it not written in the Record of the Upright:
The sun stood fast in the midst of the heavens;
it did not hasten to come in as on a whole day?"
Joshua 16:14,"There has been none like that day before it or after it,
for Y<small>HWH</small> to hearken to a man’s voice,
since Y<small>HWH</small> was fighting for Israel."
Joshua 16:15,Then Yehoshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua 16:16,"And these five kings fled
and hid themselves in a cave at Makkeda."
Joshua 16:17,"And Yehoshua was told, saying:
The five kings have been found hiding in a cave at Makkeda!"
Joshua 16:18,"Yehoshua said:
Roll large stones over the mouth of the cave,
and assign men over it to watch them."
Joshua 16:19,"As for you, do not stand around—
pursue after your enemies, attack-their-tail;
do not allow them to come back to their cities,
for Y<small>HWH</small> your God has given them into your hand!"
Joshua 16:20,"So it was, when Yehoshua and the Children of Israel had finished striking them, a very great striking-down, until they were gone,
while the survivors had escaped from them and had come back to the fortified towns—"
Joshua 16:21,"that all the fighting-people returned to the camp, to Yehoshua at Makkeda, safely;
not a man wagged his tongue against the Children of Israel."
Joshua 16:22,"And Yehoshua said:
Open the mouth of the cave
and bring out these five kings to me from the cave!"
Joshua 16:23,"They did thus:
they brought out these five kings to him from the cave,
the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hevron, the king of Yarmut, the king of Lakhish, the king of Eglon;"
Joshua 16:24,"and it was, upon their bringing out the kings to Yehoshua,
that Yehoshua called for all the fighting-men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of battle who had gone with him:
Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings!
So they came near and put their feet on their necks."
Joshua 16:25,"Yehoshua said to them:
Do not be frightened, do not be dismayed;
be strong and courageous,
for thus will Y<small>HWH</small> do to all your enemies with whom you do battle!"
Joshua 16:26,"And Yehoshua struck them down after that, and put them to death;
he hung them on five stakes,
and they were hung on the stakes until sunset."
Joshua 16:27,"Now it was, at the time of the sun coming in,
that Yehoshua commanded [them] and they took them down from the stakes,
and they threw them into the cave where they had hidden.
Then they put large stones over the mouth of the cave,
[there] until this very day."
Joshua 16:28,"As for Makkeda, Yehoshua captured [it] on that day;
he struck it with the mouth of the sword, along with its king,
and he devoted-it-to-destruction, along with every person that was in it—
he left no survivor.
And he did to the king of Makkeda as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua 16:29,"Yehoshua and all Israel with him crossed over from Makkeda to Livna
and did battle with Livna."
Joshua 16:30,"And Y<small>HWH</small> gave it too into the hand of Israel, along with its king;
he struck it with the mouth of the sword,
along with every person that was in it—
he left in it no survivor.
And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua 16:31,"Yehoshua and all Israel crossed over from Livna to Lakhish;
they encamped against it and did battle against it."
Joshua 16:32,"And Y<small>HWH</small> gave Lakhish into the hand of Israel,
so that he captured it on the second day;
he struck it with the mouth of the sword,
along with every person who was in it,
exactly as he had done to Livna."
Joshua 16:33,"Then Horam king of Gezer went up to help Lakhish,
but Yehoshua and his fighting-people struck him,
until he left him no survivor."
Joshua 16:34,"Yehoshua and all Israel with him crossed over from Lakhish to Eglon;
they encamped against it and did battle with it"
Joshua 16:35,"and captured it on that day.
They struck it with the mouth of the sword,
while every person who was in it on that day devoted-to-destruction,
exactly as he had done to Lakhish."
Joshua 16:36,"Yehoshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to
Hevron, and did battle with it;"
Joshua 16:37,"they captured it
and struck it with the mouth of the sword,
along with its king and all its towns and every person that was in it—
he left no survivor,
exactly as he had done to Eglon:
he devoted-it-to-destruction, and every person who was in it."
Joshua 16:38,"Yehoshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Devir, and did battle with it;"
Joshua 16:39,"he captured it along with its king and all its towns,
and struck them with the mouth of the sword and devoted-to-destruction every person that was in it—
he left no survivor;
as he had done to Hevron, thus he did to Devir and to its king,
as they had done to Livna and to its king."
Joshua 16:40,"So Yehoshua struck the entire land:
the highlands, the Negev, the lowlands, and the slopes,
along with all of their kings—
he left no survivor,
while all those breathing he devoted-to-destruction,
as Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, had commanded."
Joshua 16:41,"Yehoshua struck them from Kadesh-Barne’a to Gaza,
and all the region of Goshen and as far as Giv’on."
Joshua 16:42,"All these kings and their land, Yehoshua captured at one time,
since Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel, was doing battle for Israel."
Joshua 16:43,"Then Yehoshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.

Joshua 16:50,"<b>at the place that he chooses:</b> A classic Deuteronomic phrase, taken by many to refer to Jerusalem."
Joshua 17:1,"<b>Adoni-Tzedek:</b> The name means “My Lord Is Tzedek” (an Amorite god) or, more literally, “My Lord is Legitimacy,” as opposed to being a usurper. <b>Jerusalem:</b> The original meaning is likely “City of [the god] Shalem.” The name later came to be understood as “City of Peace” or “Safety” (<i>shalom</i>)."
Joshua 17:2,<b>mighty ones:</b> Boling (198): “knights.”
Joshua 17:3,"<b>Hevron:</b> Pronounced <i>hev-RONE</i>. Trad. English “Hebron,” it was located about nineteen miles southwest of Jerusalem. <b>Yarmut:</b> A town located a few miles north of Hevron. It and Eglon later in the verse are not mentioned again in the book. <b>Lakhish:</b> Pronounced <i>lah-KHEESH;</i> trad. English “Lachish,” the important Judean city about fifteen miles west of Hevron. It has been identified with Tell ed-Duweir. <b>Eglon:</b> A town in the lowlands; site identification not clear."
Joshua 17:4,"<b>and all the mighty-men:</b> Can also be read as “namely, all the mighty-men.”"
Joshua 17:5,<b>them:</b> The five Amorite kings.
Joshua 17:6,"<b>panicked:</b> A term often used of God’s fighting on behalf of the Israelites by inducing a kind of mass hysteria (e.g., Exod. 14:24, Deut. 7:23). The same verb is used in other ancient Near Eastern war accounts, with the warrior kings as the subject (Younger). <b>Pass:</b> Lit. “Ascent.” <b>Azeka … Makkeda:</b> Pronounced <i>ah-zay-KAH … mah-kay-DAH</i>."
Joshua 17:7,"<b>large stones from the heavens:</b> Hailstones are mentioned in other ancient Near Eastern battle accounts as having been sent by storm gods. “Large,” interestingly, does not appear in the extant Dead Sea Scroll manuscript of Joshua."
Joshua 17:8,"<b>still … Ayyalon:</b> The Hebrew is assonant (<i>dom … ayyalon</i>); for poetic effect in English, one could use “be still [as stone],” were it not for the presence of stones already in the chapter. The Hebrew verb (<i>d-m-m</i>) can connote both silence and immobility. Ayyalon was near Bet-Horon Pass."
Joshua 17:9,"<b>was avenged on:</b> The Hebrew nuance is difficult. Boling (1982) translates as “defeated,” but it may well indicate “getting satisfaction through the defeat of one’s enemy,” as in Judg. 16:28. <b>Record of the Upright:</b> Trad. English “the Book of Jashar.” The poetic form of the quotation from this lost work (see also II Sam. 1:18) suggests that it was an epic/poetic rendition of Israel’s history."
Joshua 17:10,<b>Y<small>HWH</small> to hearken to a man’s voice:</b> In order to intervene in nature.
Joshua 17:11,<b>And:</b> In the sense of “meanwhile” (JPS). <b>Makkeda:</b> Location unknown.

Joshua 17:14,<b>survivors had escaped:</b> The Heb. uses one root here.

Joshua 17:16,"<b>put your feet on the necks:</b> A known gesture of conquest in the ancient Near East. The Heb. <i>’oref</i> technically is the back of the neck, as I have put in translation elsewhere."
Joshua 17:17,"<b>until this very day:</b> See note to 4:9, above."
Joshua 17:18,"<b>as he had done to the king of Jericho:</b> That, however, is <i>not</i> recounted in the text. This kind of omission is often found in biblical narrative.
28–32 <b>as he had done … exactly as he had done:</b> The idea, using either one of these phrases, occurs seven times in this part of the text, stressing the campaign’s success (Meyers 2004)."
Joshua 17:19,"<b>Livna:</b> Another town of undetermined location, probably in the lowlands area."
Joshua 17:20,"<b>Kadesh-Barne’a:</b> Pronounced <i>kah-DAYSH bar-NAY-ah</i>, a site frequented by the Israelites during their earlier wilderness treks. It was the very southern boundary of Judah, the later Southern Kingdom. <b>Goshen:</b> Not to be confused with the Goshen of Exodus, the Israelites’ “neighborhood” in Egypt.
Northern Victories: The account of conquests in the north begins with a list of Canaanites who ally themselves against the Israelites from all over the country and ends with a tallying of the conquests themselves. The wording is striking; for the first time, we hear about the extermination of “anyone breathing.” In fact, the chapter comprises an entire vocabulary of verbal warfare, with “strike,” “destruction,” “wipe out,” “sword,” “take” “burn,” and “battle” all prominently featured. In a way, the whole chapter is a kind of summary of the conquest. It also parallels many structural elements of the previous chapter: a coalition of enemy kings, divine reassurance, the verb “give” as a promise of victory from God, Israelite triumph and summary (Hamilton).
Nelson sees an idealized past predominating over the strictly historical here as before, as demonstrated by the mention of Hatzor. The Bronze Age ruins of that city must have made a great impression on the writers, and since Hatzor was prominent and powerful for centuries, it makes sense for it to dominate the narrative here. In general, the Upper Galilee was not settled until centuries later."
Joshua 18:1,"Now it was,
when Yavin king of Hatzor heard,
that he sent to Yovav king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Akhshaf,"
Joshua 18:2,"and to the [other] kings that were in the north,
in the highlands and in the plain south of the Kinneret and in the lowlands
and in the Heights of Dor, toward the Sea,"
Joshua 18:3,"the Canaanites toward sunrise and toward the Sea,
and the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Yevusites in the highlands,
and the Hivvites beneath Hermon, in the region of Mitzpa."
Joshua 18:4,"They went out, they and all their camps with them,
an abundance of fighting-people, like the sand that is on the seashore in abundance,
and horse and chariot, an exceedingly abundant [number]."
Joshua 18:5,"All these kings met;
they came and encamped together at the Waters of Merom, to do battle with Israel."
Joshua 18:6,"And Y<small>HWH</small> said to Yehoshua:
Do not be afraid before them,
for tomorrow at this same time I myself will make all of them slain-ones before Israel;
their horses you will maim,
and their chariots you will burn with fire!"
Joshua 18:7,"So Yehoshua came, and all the people of battle with him, against them by the Waters of Merom, suddenly,
and they fell upon them."
Joshua 18:8,"Y<small>HWH</small> gave them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them
and pursued them as far as Greater Sidon and up to Misrefot-Mayim and as far as the Cleft of Mitzpe, toward sunrise—
they struck them until they had left them no survivor."
Joshua 18:9,"Yehoshua did to them as Y<small>HWH</small> had said to him:
their horses he maimed, and their chariots he burned with fire."
Joshua 18:10,"And Yehoshua turned back at that time and captured Hatzor,
while its king he struck down with the sword,
for Hatzor in former-times was the head [city] of all of these kingdoms."
Joshua 18:11,"They struck down every person who was in it, with the mouth of the sword;
he devoted-them-to-destruction
—no one breathing remained—
while Hatzor he burned with fire."
Joshua 18:12,"And all the towns of these kings, along with all their kings, Yehoshua captured and struck them with the mouth of the sword;
he devoted-them-to-destruction,
as Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, had commanded."
Joshua 18:13,"However: all the towns that were standing on their mounds, Israel did not burn;
only Hatzor alone did Yehoshua burn."
Joshua 18:14,"Now all the spoils of these towns, and all the cattle, the Children of Israel plundered for themselves;
only all the humans did they strike down with the mouth of the sword, until they had wiped them out—
they left no one breathing."
Joshua 18:15,"As Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe his servant,
thus had Moshe commanded Yehoshua,
and thus Yehoshua did;
he did not omit a thing of all that Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe."
Joshua 18:16,"So Yehoshua took all this land:
the highlands, all the Negev, and all the region of Goshen,
the lowlands, and the Plain,
the highlands of Israel and its lowlands,"
Joshua 18:17,"from Mount Halak that goes up toward Se’ir
as far as Baal-Gad in the Cleft of the Levanon, beneath Mount Hermon.
All their kings he captured;
he struck them down and put them to death."
Joshua 18:18,For many years Yehoshua engaged all these kings in battle.
Joshua 18:19,"There was not a town which had concluded peace with the Children of Israel
except for the Hivvites, the settled-folk of Giv’on;
all were taken in battle."
Joshua 18:20,"For it was from Y<small>HWH</small>, to make their heart strong-willed toward battle with Israel,
in order to devote-them-to-destruction,
without there being any compassion toward them;
indeed, it was to wipe them out,
as Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe.

The Vanquished Kings: This brief chapter may serve as a summary of either what has come or what will follow. Indeed, many such lists in the Bible function as textual dividers. While the precise names in lists of this kind are notoriously susceptible to error, the overall effect is rhythmic and hence fitting as a literary marker. The fact that the movement is basically from south to north supports what has gone before. Auld (1998) suggests that the fate of these kings hints at a view often found in this part of the Bible: that there is something problematic in the institution of kingship itself."
Joshua 19:15,"Yehoshua came at that time
and cut off the Anakites from the highlands, from Hevron, from Devir, from Anav—
from all the highlands of Judah and from all the highlands of Israel;

Joshua 20:25,"<b>Anakites:</b> They were taken to be a race of giants and are referred to a number of times in relation to the conquest. <b>Judah … Israel:</b> Reflecting the later political division of the country into two kingdoms; here, it is either anachronistic or purely geographical."
Joshua 20:26,<b>Gaza … Gat … Ashdod:</b> Three of the five cities that come to be connected with the Philistines; the others were Ekron and Ashkelon.
Joshua 20:27,"<b>as hereditary-property:</b> Boling (1982): “in fief,” using a term from medieval Europe. The Hebrew root, <i>n-h-l</i>, has wider connotations than the generational transfer of property; it is closer to a property <i>claim</i> and is frequently paralleled with “share/allotment” (Hawk 2000, who suggests “legitimate share”)."
Joshua 21:1,<b>Wadi Arnon:</b> A stream which empties into the Dead Sea and creates a deep gorge; it served as a boundary between Re’uven in the north and Moav in the south. <b>all the Plain toward sunrise:</b> JPS: “The eastern half of the Arabah.”
Joshua 21:2,"<b>Gil’ad:</b> Trad. English “Gilead.” The territory across the Jordan, northeast of the Dead Sea. <b>Yabbok:</b> Pronounced <i>yah-BOKE;</i> trad. English “Jabbok,” the tributary of the Jordan which historically separated Ammon and the Gil’ad region."
Joshua 21:3,"<b>southward:</b> Here, and in 13:, the text uses a different term for “south” (<i>teiman</i>). <b>Pisga:</b> “Peak,” overlooking, from the east, the Jordan and indeed much of the land of Israel. The Bible marks it as the site of Moshe’s death. <b>the Refa’im/Shades:</b> Both in biblical and ancient Canaanite literature, the term <i>refa’im</i> refers to the spirits of dead ancestors, who in popular thinking are not only still active but quite powerful. Some scholars, on the other hand, simply understand them as huge, mighty warriors."
Joshua 21:4,"<b>Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> The same Deuteronomistic phrase used of him at the beginning of the book."
Joshua 21:5,"<b>Lasharon:</b> Or “in Sharon”; LXX, on the other hand, reads the whole phrase as “Afek of the Sharon,” which parallels v.22’s “Yokne’am of the Carmel” (Rainey/Notley)."
Joshua 21:6,<b>Shimron Meron:</b> These may be two separate names.
Joshua 21:7,"<b>Megiddo:</b> The important strategic site at the western side of the Jezreel Valley, overlooking the road to the coastal plain, and hence the site of innumerable battles in antiquity."
Joshua 21:8,"<b>Gilgal:</b> LXX reads “Galil” (Galilee) here.
Introduction to the Allotment; Eastern Lands: The book of Joshua began with the centrality of Yehoshua and the mention of the two and a half tribes who settled on the east bank of the Jordan. We now start the account of land allotment, at the book’s midpoint, with the same cast of characters (Nelson). The inclusion of the Transjordanian tribes is at best idealistic for later audiences, as their region was not a part of Israelite territory past the ninth or eighth century B.C.E. Structurally, each section regarding the two and a half tribes ends (vv.14 and 33) by alluding to another anomalous situation: the allotment of land to the Levites (Hamilton). And looking ahead, the reference to Yehoshua’s old age will return at the end of the book (23:1).
According to many scholars, vv.2–6 are a later, perhaps even exilic or Persian, insertion. As Wazana (2011) proposes, these verses may be here to confirm the returnees’ claim to the land. Such a strategy appears elsewhere in the Bible through the use of genealogies, which tend to validate present power structures rather than accurately report ancient realities.
The vocabulary of the chapter is composed of virtually all the previous verbs pertinent to the conquest theme: “possess,” “settle,” “give,” “apportion,” and “inherit.”
Mitchell points out that from 13:1 on, all references to the indigenous population that remained in the land are to individual, isolated groups and no longer to the generic “Canaanites.”"
Joshua 22:1,"Now Yehoshua was old, advanced in years,
and Y<small>HWH</small> said to him:
You, you are old, advanced in years,
but the land is left with exceedingly much to possess."
Joshua 22:2,"This is the land that is left:
all the districts of the Philistines and all the Geshurite [region],"
Joshua 22:3,"—from the Shihor, that is facing Egypt, as far as the territory of Ekron northward, reckoned to the Canaanites—
five Philistine overlords: the Gazite and the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite, and the Avvites, in the south;"
Joshua 22:4,"all the land of the Canaanites
including from ’Ara, which belongs to the Sidonians, to Afek, to the territory of the Amorites,"
Joshua 22:5,"the Giblite region and all of the Levanon, toward the rising of the sun,
from Baal-Gad beneath Mount Hermon to Levo-Hamat."
Joshua 22:6,"As for all of the settled-folk of the highlands, from the Levanon to Misrefot-Mayim—all of the Sidonians,
I myself will dispossess them before the Children of Israel.
Only: have it fall to Israel as hereditary-property, as I have commanded you."
Joshua 22:7,"So-now, divide up this land as hereditary-property to the nine tribes and to the half tribe of Menashe."
Joshua 22:8,"Along with it, the Re’uvenites and the Gadites had taken their hereditary-property

Calev of Yehuda: Instead of launching immediately into the tribal apportioning of land, Chap. 14 presents, first, a general statement (vv.1–5), and then a personalized account of how Hevron was given to Calev, the only “good” spy of Num. 13 besides Yehoshua. It makes sense, perhaps, to start the allotments with one whose loyalty to God could be held up as a model for Israelite behavior and whose Judahite affiliation fits the general thrust of this section of the Bible.
Additionally, the order of allotments begins with, first, the tribe of Yehuda, and then Yosef—the two tribes that represent the later Southern Kingdom and Northern Kingdom, respectively."

Yehuda’s Territory: The bulk of what was to become the Kingdom of Judah for three and a half centuries lies within the borders enumerated here. Interestingly, the list ignores the presence of the contiguous Philistines (Auld 1998). The fact that this list is the longest and richest of all indicates the importance of Yehuda/Judah in Israelite history and historiography. Its boundaries may reflect actual districts established during the monarchy (Meyers 1998).
Before the many towns of Yehuda are listed, the role of Calev is reprised, with the additional little story of his wife, Akhsa, that will be retold in Judg. 1.
Some of the conquest details enumerated in this chapter suggest later composition, principally the mention of coastal areas (vv.45–47) and the Dead Sea, where either historical circumstances or lack of archaeological evidence pushes the text beyond the time of Yehoshua.
The chapter ends with an admission of failure. Jerusalem is not captured, and indeed was to remain outside the Israelite sphere (see the Levite’s fateful reluctance to stay overnight there in Judg. 19) until the text reports its conquest and building up by David in II Sam. 5:6–9."
Joshua 24:4,"As Y<small>HWH</small> had commanded Moshe, thus the Children of Israel did;
so they divided up the land."
Joshua 24:5,"The Children of Yehuda approached Yehoshua at Gilgal,
and Calev son of Yefunneh the Kenizzite said to him:
You yourself know the word that Y<small>HWH</small> spoke to Moshe the man of God
regarding me and regarding you, at Kadesh-Barne’a."
Joshua 24:6,"Forty years old was I when Moshe the servant of Y<small>HWH</small> sent me from Kadesh- Barne’a to spy out the land,
and I brought him back word, just as was in my heart."
Joshua 24:7,"But my brothers who went up with me melted the heart of the people [with fear],
while I fully-followed after Y<small>HWH</small> my God."
Joshua 24:8,"So Moshe swore on that day, saying:
If the land on which your foot has tread does not become hereditary-property for you and for your children, into the ages … !
since you have fully-followed after Y<small>HWH</small> your God."
Joshua 24:9,"So-now, here, Y<small>HWH</small> has kept me alive, as he promised, these forty-five years,
from when Y<small>HWH</small> spoke this word to Moshe,
when Israel was going through the wilderness.
And now, here, today I am eighty-five years old;"
Joshua 24:10,"I am still as strong today
as on the day of Moshe’s sending me—
as my might was then, so my might is now for battle,
for going out and for coming in."
Joshua 24:11,"So-now, give me these highlands, which Y<small>HWH</small> promised me on that day,
—for you yourself heard on that day—
though Anakites are there, and great and fortified towns;
perhaps Y<small>HWH</small> will be with me, and I will dispossess them,
as Y<small>HWH</small> promised."
Joshua 24:12,"So Yehoshua blessed him
and gave Hevron to Calev son of Yefunneh as hereditary-property."
Joshua 24:13,"Therefore Hevron is hereditary-property for Calev son of Yefunneh the Kenizzite, until this day,
because he was fully-true to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel."
Joshua 24:14,"Now the name of Hevron formerly was Kiryat-Arba;
he was the greatest man among the Anakites.
And the land was quiet from war."
Joshua 25:1,"Now the allotment for the tribe of the Children of Yehuda, for their clans, was:
to the border of Edom, at the Wilderness of Tzyn, toward the south, as the rightmost edge."
Joshua 25:2,"The border for them, on the south, was from the edge of the Sea of Salt, from the “tongue” that faces the south."
Joshua 25:3,"Then it goes out south of Scorpions’ Pass, and crosses over to Tzyn.
Then it goes up south of Kadesh-Barne’a
and crosses over to Hetzron and went up to Addar, swinging around to Karka."
Joshua 25:4,"Then it crosses over to Atzmon and goes out to the Wadi of Egypt;
and the outer-reaches of the border are at the Sea
… this will be the border for you on the south."
Joshua 25:5,"And the border on the east: the Sea of Salt, as far as the edge of the Jordan;
and the border on the north side:
from the “tongue” of the Sea, from the edge of the Jordan."
Joshua 25:6,"Then the border goes up to Bet-Hogla, and crosses north of Bet-Arava.
Then the border goes up to the Stone of Bohan son of Re’uven."
Joshua 25:7,"Then the border goes up to Devir from the Valley of Disaster and faces toward Gilgal,
which is opposite Red Pass, which is south of the wadi.
Then the border crosses over to the waters of the Sun Spring;
its outer-reaches are at Rogel Spring."
Joshua 25:8,"Then the border goes up the Ravine of the Son of Hinnom, along the shoulder of the Yevusite, on the south—that is Jerusalem.
Then the border goes up to the top of the hill that faces the Ravine of Ben Hinnom, seaward,
which is at the edge of the Valley of the Shades, northward."
Joshua 25:9,"Then the border diverges from the top of the hill at the Spring of the Waters of Neftoah and goes out to the towns of Mount Efron.
Then the border diverges toward Baala—that is Kiryat-Ye’arim."
Joshua 25:10,"Then the border swings around from Baala seaward to Mount Se’ir,
and crosses to the shoulder of Mount Ye’arim, northward—that is Kesalon—
and goes down to Bet-Shemesh and crosses over by Timna."
Joshua 25:11,"Then the border goes out to the shoulder of Ekron, northward.
Then the border diverges toward Shikkeron and crosses to Mount Baala.
Then it goes out to Yavne’el;
the outer-reaches of the border are at the Sea."
Joshua 25:12,"And the seaward border
is the Great Sea, and the [adjacent] territory.
This is the border of the Children of Yehuda, all around, for their clans."
Joshua 25:13,"Now to Calev son of Yefunneh he gave a portion amid the Children of Yehuda, at Y<small>HWH</small>’s order to Yehoshua:
Kiryat-Arba, the father of the Anakites—that is Hevron."
Joshua 25:14,"And Calev dispossessed from there the three sons of Anak—Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, those born of Anak."
Joshua 25:15,"He went up from there against the settled-folk of Devir
—now the name of Devir formerly was Kiryat-Sefer."
Joshua 25:16,"And Calev said:
The one who strikes Kiryat-Sefer and captures it,
I will give him Akhsa my daughter as a wife!"
Joshua 25:17,"Otniel son of Kenaz, Calev’s brother, captured it,
so he gave him Akhsa his daughter as a wife."
Joshua 25:18,"And it was when she came, that she induced him to request a field from her father.
When she alighted from the donkey, Calev said to her:
What [ails] you?"
Joshua 25:19,"She said:
Give me a gift-of-blessing!
Indeed, you have given me arid land;
you should give me pools of water!
So he gave her the Upper Pools and the Lower Pools."

Note that this chapter too ends with an admission of failure, in the survival of the Canaanite population of Gezer. It and Chap. 17 also constitute a much fuzzier account than that of Yehuda, perhaps for editorial/ideological reasons.

In that instance, a man died without male heirs, and Moshe was prevailed upon, by God as well as by the women themselves, to pass the family land on to females.
The territory of Menashe comprised the largest and biblically most significant region in the north, extending from the Mediterranean to the Jordan, and included the key towns of Megiddo, Bet-She’an, and Shekhem, among others.
For a third time in our text, the Israelites cannot dispossess the Canaanites from some areas (vv.12–13).

Joshua 28:7,"Then it goes down from Yanoah to Atarot and to Naara and touches Jericho, and goes out to the Jordan;"
Joshua 28:8,"from Tappuah the border goes seaward, to the Wadi Kama,
and its outer-reaches are at the Sea.
This is the hereditary-property of the Children of Efrayim, for their clans,"
Joshua 28:9,"with the towns set apart for the Children of Efrayim amid the hereditary-property of the Children of Menashe,
all the towns and their farmsteads."
Joshua 28:10,"But they were not able to dispossess the Canaanites, those settled in Gezer,
so the Canaanites remained settled amid Efrayim, to this day;
they became laboring serfs."
Joshua 29:1,"And the allotment for the tribe of Menashe was—since he was the firstborn of Yosef—
for Makhir firstborn of Menashe, father of Gil’ad, since he was a man of battle,
and Gil’ad and Bashan belonged to him [already]."
Joshua 29:2,"So it was for the rest of the Children of Menashe, according to their clans:
for the Children of Avi’ezer, for the Children of Helek, for the Children of Asriel, for the Children of Shekhem, for the Children of Heyfer, for the Children of Shemida—
these were the Children of Menashe son of Yosef, the males for their clans."
Joshua 29:3,"Now Tzelofhad son of Heyfer son of Gil’ad son of Makhir son of Menashe—he had no sons, but rather daughters,
and these were his daughters’ names:
Mahla, No’a, Hogla, Milka, and Tirtza."
Joshua 29:4,"They came before El’azar the priest and before Yehoshua son of Nun and before the exalted-leaders, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> commanded Moshe to give us hereditary-property amid our brothers!
And they were given, by the order of Y<small>HWH</small>, hereditary-property amid their father’s brothers."
Joshua 29:5,"The measured-areas falling to Menashe [were] ten,
aside from the land of Gil’ad and Bashan, which are across the Jordan,"
Joshua 29:6,"for the daughters of Menashe inherited hereditary-property amid their brothers,
while the land of Gil’ad was for the rest of the Children of Menashe."
Joshua 29:7,"And the border of Menashe was:
from Asher to Mikhmetat, which faces Shekhem,
then the border goes to the right/the south, toward Yashuv [and] En Tappuah,"
Joshua 29:8,"—belonging to Menashe was the region of Tappuah, but Tappuah is on the border of Menashe, belonging to the Children of Efrayim—"
Joshua 29:9,"then the border goes down to the Wadi Kana.
South of the wadi, these towns belonged to Efrayim amid the towns of Menashe;
the border of Menashe was north of the wadi,
and all their outer-reaches are at the Sea."
Joshua 29:10,"The southland belongs to Efrayim and the north belongs to Menashe, and the Sea is its border;
Asher they touch on the north, and Yissakhar toward sunrise."
Joshua 29:11,"There belonged to Menashe in Yissakhar and Asher:
Bet-She’an and its daughter-towns, Yivle’am and its daughter-towns,
along with the settled-folk of Dor and its daughter-towns,
the settled-folk of En Dor and its daughter-towns, the settled-folk of Ta’nakh and its daughter-towns, and the settled-folk of Megiddo and its daughter-towns, the Three Heights."
Joshua 29:12,"But the Children of Menashe were not able to dispossess these towns;
the Canaanites persisted in remaining-settled in this land."
Joshua 29:13,"It was, when the Children of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites into forced-labor,
but dispossess, they could not dispossess them."
Joshua 29:14,"Now the Children of Yosef spoke to Yehoshua, saying:
For-what-reason have you given me as hereditary-property [only] one allotment, one area?
For I am a numerous people,
since until now Y<small>HWH</small> has blessed me greatly!"
Joshua 29:15,"Yehoshua said to them:
If you are [such] a numerous people,
go you up into the forest
and clear [ground] for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Refaites,
since the highlands of Efrayim are too confining for you!

Joshua 30:1,"<b>a man of battle:</b> JPS: “a valiant warrior.” God is so described in the Song at the Sea, Exod. 5:3."
Joshua 30:2,"<b>our brothers:</b> Meaning “kin,” since they clearly had no brothers."
Joshua 30:3,"<b>measured-areas:</b> Boling (1982): “shares.” The Hebrew is related to the word for “rope,” hence the idea of measuring."
Joshua 30:4,"<b>to the right/the south:</b> The general orientation here is toward the east, so to face right is to face the south. <b>Yashuv:</b> Either a place name (LXX) or, following MT, <i>yoshevei</i>, “the settled-folk of.”"
Joshua 30:5,"<b>these towns … :</b> Boling (182) understands the whole phrase as a question, “Do these belong to Efrayim, amidst towns of Menashe?”"
Joshua 30:6,<b>There belonged to Menashe … :</b> The text here is in a somewhat garbled state; see the discussion in Nelson. <b>Three Heights:</b> Denoting a region.
Joshua 30:7,"<b>the forest:</b> Hinting at the extensive forestation of Canaan in biblical times. Already by the Roman period, some centuries later, the clearing of the countryside was quite advanced.
The Shilo Conference; Binyamin’s Territory: Here begins the allotment of territory for the remaining tribes. The text over the next two chapters has an almost ceremonial ring to it, as it commences with the people’s assembly at the holy city of Shilo and introduces the practice of registering the territories in writing. Israel’s coming-of-age as a community had been heralded with the writing down of the covenant in Exod. 19–24; now that it becomes a full-fledged people with the acquisition of a land, writing appears once again. The text starts with Binyamin, seemingly as a logical next step in the march from south to north, but more likely based on the concept of traditional familial order, with Yaakov’s main wives’ sons first, and then those of the maidservants (Gen. 30; Nelson).
Binyamin’s region contained Jerusalem, hence the text’s detailed interest here. It also descended several thousand feet to Jericho on the east."
Joshua 30:8,"The Children of Yosef said:
There is not [enough] for us in the highlands,
but iron chariots are everywhere among the Canaanites who are settled in the valley region,
those in Bet-She’an and its daughter-towns and those in the Valley of Yizre’el."
Joshua 30:9,"Yehoshua said to the House of Yosef, to Efrayim and to Menashe, saying:
You are a numerous people,
and you have great might;
you shall not have [just] one allotment,"
Joshua 30:10,"for the highlands shall be yours, since it is forest—
you are to clear it, and its outer-reaches will be yours,
for you will dispossess the Canaanites,
though they have iron chariots,
though they are strong."
Joshua 31:1,"Now the entire community of the Children of Israel assembled at Shilo

Joshua 31:2,"And there remained among the Children of Israel, whose hereditary-property had not been divided up, seven tribes."
Joshua 31:3,"So Yehoshua said to the Children of Israel:

Joshua 31:4,"Provide yourselves three men per tribe, that I may send them out
Let them arise and walk about in the land,

Joshua 31:5,"They are to divide it among themselves into seven divisions:
Judah will be situated on his territory in the Negev,
while the House of Yosef will be situated on their territory in the north."
Joshua 31:6,"As for you, you are to write up the land as seven portions and have it come to me here,
that I may cast the lot for you here, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small> our God."
Joshua 31:7,"For the Levites have no portion in your midst,
since the priesthood of Y<small>HWH</small> is their hereditary-property,
and Gad, Re’uven, and the half tribe of Menashe have taken their hereditary-property across the Jordan, toward sunrise,
which Moshe, the servant of God, gave them."
Joshua 31:8,"The men arose and were about to go,

Joshua 31:10,"And Yehoshua cast lots for them at Shilo, in the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>,
and Yehoshua divided up the land there for the Children of Israel, according to their divisions."
Joshua 31:11,"The lot came up of the tribe of the Children of Binyamin, for their clans:
the territory of their allotment went out between the Children of Judah and the Children of Yosef;"
Joshua 31:12,"the border for them, on the northern side, [starting] from the Jordan.
Then the border goes up to the shoulder of Jericho on the north and goes up into the highlands, seaward;
its outer-reaches are at the Wilderness of Bet-Aven."
Joshua 31:13,"Then the border crosses from there to Luz, on the shoulder of Luz, toward the Negev
—that is Bet-El.
Then the border goes down toward Atarot-Addar,
on the hill that faces Lower Bet-Horon."
Joshua 31:14,"Then the border diverges and swings around on the seaward side, toward the Negev, from the hill that faces Bet-Horon, toward the Negev;

Then it goes down to the Stone of Bohan son of Re’uven."
Joshua 31:18,"Then it crosses to the shoulder opposite the Plain, northward,

Joshua 31:29,"<b>There is not:</b> Heb. “There is not found.” <b>iron chariots:</b> The vaunted military superiority afforded by the Canaanite iron chariots is made more explicit in Judg. 4:7, 13, and 5:28. The use of iron seems to have been mainly in the chariots’ fittings (Hess)."
Joshua 31:30,"<b>the House of Yosef:</b> As Meyers (2004) notes, “the Children of Yosef” would be more common here, but the text wishes to emphasize the northern tribes."
Joshua 31:31,<b>outer-reaches:</b> Understood in this case by Boling (1982) as “approaches.”
Joshua 32:1,"<b>Shilo:</b> Pronounced <i>shee-LO</i>, this site houses the Coffer and is thus an important religious center in the traditions of Judges and Samuel. <b>Tent of Appointment:</b> Following its installation at Shilo in Yehoshua’s days, the tent shrine itself figures very little in later accounts of Israelite worship, especially contrasted to its centrality in the Torah’s account of the early wanderings."
Joshua 32:2,<b>Until when:</b> Or “how long.”
Joshua 32:3,"<b>write it up:</b> Others, “describe” (which, appropriately, is related to “inscribe” in English)."
Joshua 32:4,"<b>Judah:</b> Elsewhere I use the Hebrew form, “Yehuda,” referring to the tribe; but here it signifies the later, larger Southern Kingdom."
Joshua 32:5,<b>that is Bet-El:</b> Referring to Luz.
Joshua 32:6,<b>the Plain:</b> LXX: “to Bet-Arava.” The phrase indicates the Jordan Valley.
Joshua 32:7,"<b>Kiryat__:</b> The Hebrew form of the name is incomplete (lit. “city of …,” similar to “___ville” in English). JPS proposes “Kiryat-Ye’arim,” following the “Kiryat-’Arim” of Ezra 2:25.
The Other Six Tribes: From here the text branches out to include Shim’on, whose territory lies wholly within Yehuda’s, and a group of five northern tribes, including Dan, who migrates in Judg. 18, as a latecomer in the extreme north. The chapter ends basically as the book itself will, with Yehoshua and his inheritance (parallel to his burial in Chap. 24), and mention of the High Priest, El’azar, whose death will adorn the entire book’s last lines. Yehoshua’s inheritance also closes a bracket: what began in 14:6ff. with Calev’s inheritance here rounds out the parceling out of land to the tribes west of the Jordan (Hess)."
Joshua 33:1,"The second lot came out for Shim’on, for the tribe of the Children of Shim’on, for their clans;

28–29 <b>Sidon … Tyre:</b> The inclusion of these key cities of Phoenicia (Heb. <i>Tzidon</i> and <i>Tzor</i>) betrays ideal rather than real boundaries on the part of the writer, as often happens in Joshua (Meyers 2004)."
Joshua 34:11,"<b>fortified city of Tyre:</b> The LXX reads “the spring [<i>’ayin</i>] of the fortress of Tyre,” different from <i>’ir</i>, “city.” The second “returned” in this verse may be a scribal error here, and hence unnecessary. <b>Mahalav:</b> The Hebrew is unclear; many read as here, similar to the “Ahlav” of Judg. 1:31.
Towns of Asylum: An integral part of the plans for occupying the land, as already laid out in Num. 35:6, 9–34 and Deut. 19:1–13, is the setting aside of six towns on either side of the Jordan as safe havens for those who commit unintentional murder (manslaughter). Unlike the brief chapter here, the text in Numbers goes into great detail, both in laying out hypothetical variations on manslaughter and in specifying the punishment and its time period. But our text has also added aspects of Deut. 19:1–10, in a move that foreshadows how Rabbinic law will handle different biblical texts (Meyers 2004). Once again, we can observe an active and fluid attitude to texts on the part of the transmitters and editors.
While one could compare this institution, which is a cut above the age-old practice of family vengeance, to other ancient Near Eastern societies’ solutions to the problem, in the context of Yehoshua it functions to cap the account of precisely how the land was to be allotted, continuing into the next chapter, which deals with another unusual case: the landless Levites."

Joshua 35:5,"And if the blood redeemer pursues after him,

Joshua 35:6,"Let him stay in that town until he stands before the community in judgment,
until the death of the Great Priest that is there in those days;

The Levite Towns: In these closing chapters related to the parceling out of the land, the text treats the somewhat unusual cases—here, the Levites, who do not receive a broad territory like the other tribes, and in the next chapter, the two and a half tribes that settle on the east side of the Jordan.
The long account of Levitical towns by clan, with its patterned number of forty-eight (twelve times four), introduces a further note of order into the measured lines of territory recounted thus far.
Vv.41–43 provide a grand conclusion to the whole account of apportioning the land that started in Chap. 13. In just three verses, repetition (“give” three times and “all” six) and a potent set of ideas—the oath to the ancestors, the helplessness of the people’s enemies, and the fulfillment of the divine word—summarize the idealistic, ideological vision of the book."
Joshua 36:1,"The heads of the Levite Father’s [Houses] approached El’azar the priest and Yehoshua son of Nun
and the heads of the tribal Father’s [Houses] of the Children of Israel"
Joshua 36:2,"and spoke to them at Shilo, in the land of Canaan, saying:
Y<small>HWH</small> commanded by the hand of Moshe to give us towns to settle in, and their pasture-lands for our animals!"

Finishing Business: The Two and a Half Tribes: The final three chapters of Joshua are concerned with the community of the past and the community of the future. In that context, the long story in Chap. 22 both poses and solves the potentially dangerous problem of what constitutes proper worship of YHWH. The opening five verses are strongly Deuteronomistic in language, suggesting a resolution of the entire conquest story, with the last pieces of territory (albeit east of the Jordan) being allotted to Israelites tribes. But beginning in v.11, a major rift seems in the offing, with the bulk of the Israelite tribes, those west of the Jordan, seriously misunderstanding the construction of a gigantic altar by their eastern counterparts. They take this act as a major violation of the worship of YHWH, and hence of the covenant itself, even likening it to two major biblical stories of treachery: the account in Num. 25 of how the Israelites “went whoring” after foreign gods, and Akhan’s violation of the Israelite rules of war earlier in Joshua (Chap. 7), after which the wording here is perhaps modeled. In addition, as Hamilton notes, a specific verb for “rebel” (m-r-d, “revolt”) uses up a fifth of its appearances in the entire Bible in this chapter.
The two and a half tribes’ impassioned reply in vv.22–29 is a stirring testament to their group loyalty and to their faithfulness to Y<small>HWH</small>. For them, the huge altar is supposed to act as a kind of giant flag or similar symbol, to signal to the Israelites and to others that they have by no means forgotten Y<small>HWH</small>’s sanctuary, where the Coffer is situated. The resolution that follows, sanctioned by the very priest (Pin’has) who had violently stemmed the tide of idolatry in Num. 25, lets the aggregate Israelite community breathe easier (vv.30 and 33, “it was good in their eyes”), and civil war is averted. Conflicts between tribes will not be so peacefully resolved in the next book, Judges. For the moment, though, Joshua can at least move toward its conclusion on a tranquil and idealizing note.
Not all readers will accept this “happy ending”; for them, the reality of two and a half tribes existing in a geographically ambiguous situation is still cause for concern, as the continued presence of Canaanites among the new settlers had been earlier. Israelite identity is still in question on some level (Hawk 2000)."

Joshua 37:13,"All the towns for the Children of Merari, according to their remaining clans from the Levite clans,
their allotment was towns, twelve."
Joshua 37:14,"All the towns of the Levites amid the holdings of the Children of Israel,
[were] towns, forty-eight, and their pasture-lands;"
Joshua 37:15,"these towns were, town by town, [considered] along with its pasture-lands all around it,
thus for all these towns."
Joshua 37:16,"So Y<small>HWH</small> gave to Israel all the land that he had sworn to give to their fathers;
they took possession of it and settled in it."
Joshua 37:17,"And Y<small>HWH</small> gave rest to them round about,
just as he had sworn to their fathers,
so that no man was able to stand up before them among all their enemies—
all their enemies, Y<small>HWH</small> gave into their hand."
Joshua 37:18,"There did not fail one thing of all the good things
that Y<small>HWH</small> had promised to the House of Israel;
all of it came-to-pass."
Joshua 38:1,"Then Yehoshua called the Re’uvenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Menashe"
Joshua 38:2,"and said to them:
You yourselves have kept all that Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, commanded you,
and you have hearkened to my voice in all that I have commanded you:"
Joshua 38:3,"you have not abandoned your brothers these many years, until this day,
but you have kept the keeping
of the commandment of Y<small>HWH</small> your God."
Joshua 38:4,"But now, Y<small>HWH</small> your God has given rest to your brothers, as he promised them.
So-now, face about and go you forth to your tents, to the land of your holdings
which Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, gave to you across the Jordan."
Joshua 38:5,"Only: be very careful to observe the commandment and the Instruction that Moshe, the servant of Y<small>HWH</small>, commanded you:
to love Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
to walk in all his ways, to keep his commandments, to cleave to him
and to serve him
with all your heart and with all your being!"
Joshua 38:6,"So Yehoshua blessed them and sent them off, and they went back to their tents."
Joshua 38:7,"Now to the half tribe of Menashe, Moshe had given [a share] in Bashan,
and to its [other] half Yehoshua had given-share beside their brothers, across the Jordan, seaward.
And also, when he had sent them off to their tents, he had blessed them"
Joshua 38:8,"and had said to them, saying:
With much wealth return to your tents, and with exceedingly many livestock,
and with silver and with gold and with bronze and with iron and with clothing, exceedingly much;
portion out your enemies’ spoils with your brothers!"
Joshua 38:9,"So they returned and went, the Children of Re’uven, the Children of Gad, and the half tribe of Menashe, from among the Children of Israel,
from Shilo which is in the land of Canaan,
to go to the land of Gil’ad, to the land of their holding which they had made-as-their-holding
in accordance with the order of Y<small>HWH</small>, by the hand of Moshe."
Joshua 38:10,"They came to the districts of the Jordan which are in the land of Canaan,
and the Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad and the half tribe of Menashe built a sacrificial-altar there, by the Jordan,
an altar large to see."
Joshua 38:11,"Now the Children of Israel heard it said:
Here, the Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad and the half tribe of Menashe have built an altar opposite the land of Canaan,
in the districts of the Jordan, across from the Children of Israel—"
Joshua 38:12,"the Children of Israel heard [it], and so they assembled, the entire community of the Children of Israel, at Shilo,
to go up against them in force."
Joshua 38:13,"And the Children of Israel sent Pin’has son of El’azar the priest
to the Children of Re’uven, to the Children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Menashe, in the land of Gil’ad,"
Joshua 38:14,"and ten exalted-leaders with him—one leader, one leader [apiece] per Father’s House among all the tribes of Israel,
each one a head of his Father’s House were they, among the thousands of Israel."
Joshua 38:15,"They came to the Children of Re’uven, to the Children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Menashe, in the land of Gil’ad
and spoke to them, saying:"
Joshua 38:16,"Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>’s entire community:
What is this sacrilege by which you have committed sacrilege against the God of Israel,
by turning today from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>
by building yourselves an altar
for transgressing today against Y<small>HWH</small>?!"
Joshua 38:17,"Was the iniquity of Pe’or too little for us
from which we have not become purified until this day,
—a plague was upon the community of Y<small>HWH</small>!—"
Joshua 38:18,"that you turn today from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>?
It will be:
should you revolt today against Y<small>HWH</small>,
tomorrow, he will be furious against the entire community of Israel!"
Joshua 38:19,"Surely, if the land of your holdings is polluted, cross you over to the land of Y<small>HWH</small>’s holding, where the Dwelling of Y<small>HWH</small> dwells, and get holdings in our midst—
but against Y<small>HWH</small>, do not revolt!
And against us, do not revolt by building yourselves an altar
apart from the altar for Y<small>HWH</small> our God!"
Joshua 38:20,"Did not Akhan son of Zerah commit sacrilege, yes, sacrilege regarding the devoted-things,
so that there was fury against the entire community of Israel?
And he did not perish as [just] one man for his iniquity?"
Joshua 38:21,"The Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad and the half tribe of Menashe answered;
they spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel:"
Joshua 38:22,"God of gods is Y<small>HWH</small>!
God of gods is Y<small>HWH</small>!
He knows, and Israel itself will know:
if [it was] in revolting or in committing sacrilege against Y<small>HWH</small>
—do not deliver us on this day!—"
Joshua 38:23,"by building ourselves an altar to turn from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>,
or if by offering up offerings-up and grain-gifts,
or if by performing on it sacrifices of <i>shalom</i>,
may Y<small>HWH</small> himself examine it!"
Joshua 38:24,"… if it was not out of deep-concern over a matter that we have done this, saying:
On the morrow your children might say to our children, saying:
What is between you and Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel?"
Joshua 38:25,"As a border between us and you, O Children of Re’uven and Children of Gad, Y<small>HWH</small> made the Jordan;
you have no portion in Y<small>HWH</small>!—
Your children would cause our children to cease holding Y<small>HWH</small> in awe!"
Joshua 38:26,"So we said:
Let us act for ourselves to build an altar,
not for offerings-up, not for sacrifices,"
Joshua 38:27,"but rather as a witness let it be between us and you, and between our generations after us,
[for us] to serve the service of Y<small>HWH</small> in his presence,
through our offerings-up, through our sacrifices, and through our <i>shalom</i>-offerings,
so that your children will not say on the morrow to our children: You have no portion in Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Joshua 38:28,"And we said:
It will be,
if they say [thus] to us and to our generations on the morrow,
then we will say:
See the replica of the altar of Y<small>HWH</small> that our fathers made,
neither for offering-up nor for sacrifice;
rather, it is a witness between us and you!"
Joshua 38:29,"[Heaven] forbid for us to revolt against Y<small>HWH</small>, to turn today from [following] after Y<small>HWH</small>
by building an altar for offering-up, for grain-gift, and for sacrifice
aside from the altar of Y<small>HWH</small> our God that is in front of his Dwelling!"
Joshua 38:30,"Pin’has the priest and the leaders of the community and the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him heard
the words that the Children of Re’uven, the Children of Gad, and the Children of Menashe spoke,
and it was good in their eyes;"
Joshua 38:31,"so Pin’has son of El’azar the priest said to the Children of Re’uven, to the Children of Gad, and to the Children of Menashe:
Today we know that Y<small>HWH</small> is in our midst,
in that you did not commit sacrilege against Y<small>HWH</small> with this act-of-sacrilege;
so then, you have rescued the Children of Israel from the hand of Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Joshua 38:32,"So Pin’has son of El’azar the priest and the leaders returned from the Children of Re’uven and from the Children of Gad,
from the land of Gil’ad, to the land of Canaan, to the Children of Israel,
and returned word to them."
Joshua 38:33,"The word was good in the eyes of the Children of Israel,
so the Children of Israel blessed God,
and they decided not to go up against them in force,
to wreak ruin on the land in which the Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad were settled."
Joshua 38:34,"And the Children of Re’uven and the Children of Gad called the altar [:Witness],
for it is a witness between us
that Y<small>HWH</small> is God!

Yehoshua’s Parting Speech: The text now picks up, as it were, from the narrative in 13:1, using the same formula (“Now Yehoshua was old …”). We are at the end of Yehoshua’s life. In the first of two extended speeches to the Israelites, he gathers the people in order to personally plead with them to understand the importance of this moment. Hamilton notes three exhortations in this speech: (1) for the leaders of the people to be faithful to God’s “Instruction”; (2) for them to maintain separation from the Canaanites; and (3) for them to love God as loyal vassals. Not surprisingly, Yehoshua uses classic Deuteronomistic words, including such terms as “strengthen,” “keep,” “observe,” “Instruction,” “[do not] turn aside,” “serve,” “cleave to,” “love,” “dispossess,” and “cross.” The sum total of this vocabulary is simply expressed: you are to love God and keep his commandments; do not turn aside from them, or else you will be dispossessed from the land. Or: having now received God’s gift of the land, do not turn to idolatry, or you will wind up in exile.
Another notable verbal feature of the chapter is the repetition fourteen times (a doubling of the “perfect” seven) of the phrase “Y<small>HWH</small> your God.” It too recalls Deuteronomy, where it occurs some twenty-two times. So Yehoshua is once again linked to his predecessor Moshe."
Joshua 39:1,"It was, many years after Y<small>HWH</small> had given Israel rest from all their enemies round about
—now Yehoshua was old, advanced in years—"
Joshua 39:2,"that Yehoshua called all Israel: its elders, its heads, its judges, and its officials,
and said to them:
I have become old, I am advanced in years."
Joshua 39:3,"Now you yourselves have seen
all that Y<small>HWH</small> your God did to all the nations before you,
for Y<small>HWH</small> your God,
he is the one who does battle for you!"
Joshua 39:4,"See, I cast [lots] for you from these nations that were left, as hereditary-property for your tribes, from the Jordan
—including all the nations that I cut down—and [from] the Great Sea, toward the coming in of the sun."
Joshua 39:5,"Y<small>HWH</small> your God, he will push them out before you
and will dispossess them from before you,
so that you will possess their land,
as Y<small>HWH</small> your God promised you."
Joshua 39:6,"You are to be very strong,
in keeping and in observing all that is written in the Record of the Instruction of Moshe,
so as not to turn aside from it, right or left,"
Joshua 39:7,"so as not to come in among these nations that are left beside you;
the name of their gods you are not to invoke, you are not to swear [by them],
you are not to serve them, you are not to bow down to them."
Joshua 39:8,"Rather, to Y<small>HWH</small> your God you are to cleave, as you have done, to this day!"

Parting Ceremony: In contrast to the previous speech, this long chapter has some of the earmarks of a covenant-making or covenant-renewal ceremony. All the Israelites and their various leaders are “stationed” before God at the important city of Shekhem. The speaker begins with an extended history lesson, tracing Israel’s lineage to idol-worshippers living beyond the Euphrates and proceeding through the gift of the land to the Patriarchs, the enslavement and liberation from Egypt, and God’s guidance to the Promised Land. The wording reveals the emotional underpinnings: “give” occurs six times in thirteen verses at the chapter’s beginning, just as it was central in Chap. 1. “Serve,” another key verb that figured in Chap. 1, occurs here some fourteen times. God, as the prime subject of the speech, is connected to numerous verbs of action throughout (“took,” “led,” “gave,” “sent,” “smote,” “took out,” “brought,” “rescued”), in order to emphasize that everything flows from what he has done for the Israelites. Beginning in v.14, Yehoshua, with the repeated, rhetorically significant “So-now,” launches into the official, ceremonial request, urging the people to serve God as “I and my household” do. There ensues a kind of scripted dialogue (vv.16–24), in which the leader basically goads the people to affirm and reaffirm their intention to follow YHWH, and they respond positively. All is sealed with a written document and a great stone as unshakable witnesses.
As has often been pointed out, many of these elements are common to ancient Near Eastern treaty formulas, especially from Hittite documents. Missing from the usual covenant ceremony, as Nelson notes, are the pointed threats leveled at potential violators, such as we find in Lev. 26 and Deut. 27. So this chapter, while it uses common conventions, may be a dramatic device, intended to impress upon audiences the seriousness not only of the end of the book but of the whole sequence that began with the promises of Genesis. It should also be noted that vv.2–4 of the chapter were used later, by the Rabbis before the third century <small>C.E.</small>, as part of the family Passover meal text (Haggadah), and they still have that function today.
Both chapter and book end with three notices related to dying or death. First, Yehoshua himself dies; then comes the final burial of Yosef’s bones, which had been brought up from Egypt at the time of the Exodus (Exod. 13:19), in conformity with his wishes in Gen. 50:24–25; and finally we are told of the death of the High Priest, El’azar. All of these leaders find their resting place on northern soil, traditions that were ultimately incorporated into the final version of the book. That the priestly figure is the last to be mentioned may suggest a priestly editor, or at least one for whom cultic matters were central. At any rate, the death notices signal that the long journey, both literal and figurative, that was begun in the book of Exodus is now over. And “the reader is left with the sense of a perfected past … for now all is well” (Fishbane).
There has long been debate about this chapter among scholars, starting from the premise that it and the previous one are slightly redundant. Indeed, the openings of both are so similar in their convoking of the people and their leaders that one cannot help but think that one chapter or the other is a later addition. The location of the ceremony at Shekhem, first capital of the Northern Kingdom (tenth century), is seen by some as an indication that the hope of recovering the north, destroyed by Assyria in 722, remained a live issue in ancient Israel and perhaps influenced the composition of Joshua (Schniedewind 2004). Others have viewed our chapter as coming out of exile many centuries hence, given its troubled portrait of a “zealous” God, whom “you will not be able to serve” (v.19). But the people’s assent to staying in the covenant resonates with the desire of the Bible’s writers to remain faithful to a long-standing heritage and mission. The doubling effect created by linking Chaps. 23 and 24 serves to confirm this direction.
The book of Joshua, however, ends with a paradox: a people mostly united and a land mostly conquered, with a leader dying (and no successor in sight) and Canaanites still living among them. It will be up to Judges, which picks up at Yehoshua’s death, to see if unity and proper leadership will ultimately prevail. "

Joshua 40:8,"Here, I am going today the way of all the earth;

Joshua 40:9,"But it shall be,
just as there has come upon you every good thing that Y<small>HWH</small> your God promised you,
so can Y<small>HWH</small> your God cause to come upon you every evil thing,

Joshua 41:1,"Yehoshua gathered all the tribes of Israel at Shekhem;
he called together all the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officials,
and they stationed themselves in the presence of God."
Joshua 41:2,"And Yehoshua said to all the people:
Thus says Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel:
Across the River were your fathers settled in former ages
—Terah father of Avraham and father of Nahor—
and they served other gods."
Joshua 41:3,"But I took your father Avraham from Across the River
and I had him go throughout all the land of Canaan;

Joshua 41:6,"I brought your fathers out from Egypt, and you came to the Sea,
and Egypt pursued after your fathers with chariots and riders at the Sea of Reeds."
Joshua 41:7,"They cried out to Y<small>HWH</small>, and he put deep-darkness between you and the Egyptians,
and brought down the Sea upon them, so that it covered them.
Your [own] eyes saw what I did in Egypt!
And you stayed in the wilderness for many years;"
Joshua 41:8,"then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who were settled across the Jordan, and they did battle with you,
but I gave them into your hand, so that you took possession of their land,
and I wiped them out from before you."
Joshua 41:9,"Then Balak son of Tzippor arose, king of Moav, and he waged battle against Israel:

so he blessed, yes, blessed you,
and I rescued you from his hand."

but I gave them into your hand."
Joshua 41:12,"I sent the hornet before you
and it drove them out before you,
[like the] two Amorite kings—not with your sword and not with your bow."
Joshua 41:13,"And I gave you a land for which you did not labor,
towns which you did not build, in which you settled,
vineyards and olive-groves which you did not plant, [and from which] you are eating!"
Joshua 41:14,"So-now,
hold Y<small>HWH</small> in awe and serve him in integrity and trust;
remove the gods whom your fathers had served across the River and in Egypt
and serve Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Joshua 41:15,"But if it be evil in your eyes to serve Y<small>HWH</small>,
choose yourselves today whom you wish to serve—
whether the gods whom your fathers who were Across the River served
or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are settled.
But as for me and my household, we will serve Y<small>HWH</small>!"
Joshua 41:16,"The people answered and said:

and who performed before our eyes these great signs
and kept-us-safe on all the way that we went
and among all the peoples through whose midst we crossed—"
Joshua 41:18,"Y<small>HWH</small> has driven out all the peoples, the Amorites, the settled-folk of the land, before us.
We too will serve Y<small>HWH</small>,
indeed, he is our God!"
Joshua 41:19,"And Yehoshua said to the people:

he is a zealous God,
and will not bear your transgression and your sins!"

You are witnesses against yourselves
that you on your part have chosen Y<small>HWH</small> for yourselves, to serve him.
They said:
Witnesses!—"

and incline your heart to Y<small>HWH</small>, the God of Israel!"
Joshua 41:24,"The people said to Yehoshua:
It is Y<small>HWH</small> our God we will serve;
to his voice we will hearken!"

Joshua 41:26,"And Yehoshua wrote down these words in the Record of God’s Instruction.
Then he took a large stone and erected it there,
beneath the tamarisk that was in the Holy-Place of Y<small>HWH</small>."
Joshua 41:27,"And Yehoshua said to all the people:

it had become hereditary-property for the Children of Yosef."
Joshua 41:33,"And El’azar son of Aharon died;
they buried him on the hill of Pin’has his son, which had been given to him in the highlands of Efrayim.

Joshua 41:34,"<b>cleave to:</b> Connoting “be in alliance with.” <b>come among:</b> The Hebrew is possibly a pun; “come in to,” an alternate translation here, can often mean “to have sexual intercourse with” in the Hebrew Bible."
Joshua 41:35,<b>a trapping-net and a snare:</b> These hunting devices are regularly applied to the moral/ethical sphere in such books as Proverbs. Here the connotation is the hidden but lethal danger of being seduced into acts of infidelity to God.
Joshua 41:36,"<b>going … the way of all the earth:</b> As Meyers (2004) points out, this phrase, a poetic description of death, is otherwise employed only of David (I Kings 2:2); here it reinforces the royal tone with which Joshua opened in Chap. 1."
Joshua 42:1,"<b>Shekhem:</b> Pronounced <i>sheh-KHEM;</i> trad. English “Shechem,” a city featured in a number of biblical narratives (for example, Gen. 34). It was situated near present-day Nablus, about forty miles north of Jerusalem, and was not part of the territories prominent in the conquest account in the first half of the book. <b>stationed themselves:</b> JPS: “presented themselves.” The phrase recalls another seminal moment, Israel standing at Sinai to make the covenant (Exod. 9:7)."
Joshua 42:2,"<b>Avraham:</b> The “a’s” are pronounced as “ah,” with the accent on the last syllable of the name; trad. English “Abraham.”"
Joshua 42:3,"<b>Across the River:</b> The Euphrates—either in Mesopotamia or west of the river, i.e., Harran, as would be indicated by Assyrian and Persian terminology (Nelson). Some connect “across” (Heb. <i>mei-eiver</i>) with the term “Hebrews” (Heb. <i>ivriyyim).</i>"
Joshua 42:4,"<b>Mount Se’ir:</b> Southeast of the Negev, in today’s Jordan. It was considered the home of the Edomites, Esav’s descendants, and is frequently connected to <b>Y<small>HWH</small></b> in the Bible. <b>down to Egypt:</b> LXX adds here, parallel to Deut. 26:5b, “There they became a large, numerous, and powerful nation, and the Egyptians oppressed them.”"
Joshua 42:5,<b>dealt blows:</b> Or “plagued”; the present translation is more literal. <b>with what I did:</b> The plagues.
Joshua 42:6,<b>waged battle:</b> Not reported or even suggested in Num. 22; Boling (182) thinks that this statement may be tongue in cheek. But it might also mean “set out to fight” (Nelson).
Joshua 42:7,"<b>he blessed, yes, blessed you:</b> Gray (1986): “he went on blessing you.”
11–12 <b>they waged battle … :</b> Note that here, in contrast to the famous story in Chap. 6, the residents of Jericho put up a fight. So, as often happens in the Bible, two versions or traditions about an event appear in the same book."
Joshua 42:8,<b>hornet:</b> An image already used in Exod. 23:28 and Deut. 7:20. Some understand it as a remnant of a hoary practice of letting insects loose in war by catapulting them in clay vessels. <b>two Amorite kings:</b> The aforementioned Sihon and Og. <b>not with your sword … not with your bow:</b> See Yaakov’s words in Gen. 48:22.
Joshua 42:9,"<b>a holy godhead:</b> A rare case of Heb. <i>elohim</i> accompanied by a plural adjective; the meaning seems to be “divine power.” <b>zealous:</b> Heb. <i>kanno’.</i> In the form <i>kanna’,</i> God is so described in Exod. 20:5 and 34:14, and Deut. 4:24, 5:9, and 6:15. Woudstra describes the concept as “God’s zeal for the maintenance of his honor”; it is a form of anger. It is often mistranslated as “jealous.” <b>your transgression and your sins:</b> The pronoun is in the plural."
Joshua 42:10,<b>remove the foreign gods:</b> Yaakov makes the same request in Gen. 35:2.
Joshua 42:11,<b>a law and a judgment:</b> Boling (1982): “a legal precedent.”
Joshua 42:12,"<b>the Record of God’s Instruction:</b> Not the usual “Record of the Instruction of Moshe,” but of God. <b>tamarisk:</b> Heb. <i>elon,</i> related to the “oak” (<i>ela</i>) in 19:33, above. <b>the Holy-Place:</b> The “Dwelling” (Tabernacle), but some others suggest “sacred precinct.”"
Joshua 42:13,<b>spoke with us:</b> Boling (1982): “negotiated with us.”
Joshua 42:14,"<b>servant of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> Yehoshua, at death, finally merits the title of his master Moshe. <b>a hundred and ten years old:</b> The same life span as Yosef, another northern figure."
Joshua 42:15,<b><i>kesitas:</i></b> See Gen. 33:19. The term may indicate a weight or measure of some kind. Some render it as “lambs’ worth.”
