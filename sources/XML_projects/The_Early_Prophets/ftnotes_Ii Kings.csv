Ii Kings 1:1,"<b>rebelled:</b> See note to I Kings 12:19, above. Moav’s rebellion will resurface in Chap. 3."
Ii Kings 1:2,"<b>became sick [from his injuries]:</b> Biblical Hebrew does not make a distinction between illness and injury, the latter of which is clearly meant here. <b>Baal Zevuv/Master of Flies:</b> Pronounced <i>ze-VOOV.</i> The name is a nasty pun on “Baal Zevul,” “Baal the Exalted,” commonly found in Ugaritic texts. See the name “Izevel” in I Kings 16:31, for a possible similar usage. The trad. English for the name is “Baal-zebub,” which in later Jewish and then Christian tradition became Beelzebub, a significant demon and eventually a nickname for the Devil. <b>Ekron:</b> Pronounced <i>eh-KROHN.</i> One of the five major Philistine towns."
Ii Kings 1:3,<b>Eliyya:</b> A shortened variant of Eliyyahu.
Ii Kings 1:4,<b>to him:</b> To the king.
Ii Kings 1:5,"<b>hairy:</b> Heb. <i>baal se’ar</i>, “possessing (much) hair,” echoing “Baal Zevuv” (Cohn 2000). It is not clear whether the text means a hairy man or merely one wearing animal skins. <b>leather:</b> Lit. “[animal] skin.”"
Ii Kings 1:6,<b>captain of fifty:</b> Head of a defined military unit. The term was common in the ancient Near East.
Ii Kings 1:7,"<b>man … fire:</b> Martin notes the sound play here, which continues throughout the chapter: <i>ish</i> and <i>esh.</i> <b>heavens:</b> In the usual biblical sense of “the sky” (and not the abode of the blessed dead, as in later concepts)."
Ii Kings 1:8,"<b>fire of God:</b> The phrase “X of God” is frequently used to express the superlative in the Bible (as in Gen. 35:5, I Sam. 26:)."

Ii Kings 1:10,"<b>Yehoram:</b> Some versions insert “his brother” after the name. Note that the text cites two kings with the same name, north and south."
Ii Kings 2:1,"<b>storm:</b> Others, “whirlwind.” This phenomenon is often associated with the appearance of God in the Bible, most famously and dramatically in Job 38:1. <b>Gilgal:</b> The term for a “round place” of stones or a round platform, this particular one is probably not the significant one near Jericho (see Josh. 4:19), but a site in a central location of the Northern Kingdom."
Ii Kings 2:2,<b>Sons of the Prophets:</b> See note to I Kings 20:5. <b>from your head:</b> The phrase describes the master-servant relationship here (Cogan/Tadmor).
Ii Kings 2:3,<b>Thus the two of them walked on:</b> Reminiscent of the pregnant “Thus the two of them walked on together” in the Avraham/Yitzhak (Abraham/Isaac) story of Gen. 22.
Ii Kings 2:4,"<b>folded:</b> A rare biblical word, meaning more precisely “wrapped.”"
Ii Kings 2:5,"<b>walking:</b> Also in the sense of an auxiliary verb that conveys repetition—for example, “going along and speaking,” meaning “continuing to speak.”"
Ii Kings 2:6,"<b>Israel’s chariotry and its horsemen!:</b> Elisha appears to be equating Eliyyahu with the entire army, as if to suggest that the prophet is the people’s true strength."
Ii Kings 2:7,"<b>Where is Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> He equates the disappearance of his master with a rupture in divine-human communication. <b>indeed:</b> An oft-used emendation from <i>’af hu</i>, “even he,” to <i>efo</i>. No good solution has been found to this awkward sentence."
Ii Kings 2:8,"<b>new:</b> See note to I Kings 11:29. <b>bowl:</b> Others, “dish,” “pot.”"
Ii Kings 2:9,<b>outflow:</b> Source.
Ii Kings 2:10,"<b>the waters were healed:</b> See Exod. 15:–25, where God “heals” bitter water by having Moshe throw a piece of wood into it."
Ii Kings 2:11,"<b>baldhead:</b> Others, more colloquially, “baldy.”"
Ii Kings 2:12,"<b>ripped up:</b> Are they killed, or “mauled,” as most translations have it? <b>forty-two:</b> The number is used later to count Yehu’s victims in 10:14; it looks like another “special” biblical number (forty plus two, or seven times three times two)."
Ii Kings 3:1,
Ii Kings 3:2,<b>standing-stone:</b> A cultic image.
Ii Kings 3:3,"<b>Mesha:</b> Pronounced <i>may-SHAH</i>. See the reference to Moav in the Commentary. <b>he would supply:</b> As tribute. Others, “had to supply,” implying a one-time payment (Martin)."

Ii Kings 3:6,<b>poured water over the hands:</b> As servant; a sign of deference.
Ii Kings 3:7,"<b>What have I to do with you?:</b> Or, “What business do we have?” When “Go” follows in the next line, we get the striking Heb. <i>Ma li va-lakh? Lekh!</i>"
Ii Kings 3:8,<b>when the strummer strummed:</b> Biblical Hebrew uses <i>n-g-n</i> to specifically describe playing stringed instruments; a more general musical verb would have been <i>z-m-r</i>.
Ii Kings 3:9,<b>wind … showers:</b> Which would be necessary for filling up the wadi with water.
Ii Kings 3:10,"<b>mar:</b> Lit., “cause pain.”"
Ii Kings 3:11,<b>all those belting on … and upward:</b> Everyone of military age (twenty) and skill.
Ii Kings 3:12,"<b>red:</b> Reflecting the rising sun, and also the reputation of the mountains of Edom; note Heb. <i>adom</i>, “red.”"
Ii Kings 3:13,"<b>they came against it … :</b> The text here is in disarray; “strike” appears in the Hebrew three times in quick succession, so many interpreters read the second one as “came,” as I do here."
Ii Kings 3:14,"<b>Kir-Hareset:</b> Some identify the site with the later ruins of a Crusader castle, Kerak, situated in an elevated area east of the Dead Sea. It is strategically located on the north-south King’s Highway."
Ii Kings 3:15,"<b>with him:</b> Emending <i>oto</i> to <i>itto</i>, as some manuscripts have. <b>to … Edom:</b> Some emend to “against … Aram” (Hebrew <i>d</i> and <i>r</i> letters are similar in appearance)."
Ii Kings 3:16,"<b>wrath:</b> The situation is unclear, since the text seems to slip into a Moabite perspective, namely that the human sacrifice works and the Moabite god triumphs. The effect of the passage is to deny the Israelites a complete victory under an Omride king (Cogan/Tadmor, quoting D. N. Freedman)."
Ii Kings 4:1,"<b>cried out:</b> Lodged a formal appeal. <b>take away … as slaves:</b> The practice of indentured servitude was widespread in the ancient Near East, and it is this, rather than chattel slavery (such as later existed in America and elsewhere), that is the more common form in the Bible."
Ii Kings 4:2,"<b>Shunem:</b> Below the slopes of the Hill of Moreh, about fifteen miles from Mount Carmel. <b>prominent:</b> Heb. <i>gadol</i>, usually rendered here as “great.”"
Ii Kings 4:3,"<b>Gehazi:</b> Pronounced <i>gay-ha-ZEE</i>. The meaning of the name is not certain, but Gray links it to an Arabic verb that means “to be greedy,” appropriate here."
Ii Kings 4:4,"<b>trouble:</b> Lit., “trembling.” The concept is of “solicitous deference” (Gray 1970)."
Ii Kings 4:5,"<b>when time revives:</b> Next year. The phrase recalls the Sara story in Gen. 18; there, too, the woman scoffs at the idea that she will have a son, and there, too, the child comes close to death at one point. <b>you:</b> In the text as written (the <i>ketiv</i>), this common word is spelled out as <i>atti</i> (instead of the usual <i>atta</i>), suggesting a northern origin of this tale."
Ii Kings 4:6,"<b>New-Moon:</b> In biblical Israel, the New Moon was a significant religious occasion, involving a sacred meal with family and a visit to a holy man (such as I Sam. 20:6) and/or a shrine (I Sam. 1)."
Ii Kings 4:7,<b>Mount Carmel:</b> The scene of Eliyyahu’s great victory over the prophets of Baal in I Kings 18.
Ii Kings 4:8,"<b>feelings:</b> Frequently (and wrongly) translated as “soul,” Heb. <i>nefesh</i> can mean “being,” “essence,” or “life” (as Cohn 2000 renders it here), or even “throat,” that is, “life-breath.”"
Ii Kings 4:9,<b>set me [too much] at ease:</b> Or “give me false hopes” (JPS: “mislead me”).
Ii Kings 4:10,"<b>put my rod on the face of the lad:</b> We might expect a miracle from a holy man’s staff, but none will be forthcoming until Elisha shows up and bodily revives the child."
Ii Kings 4:11,<b>he put his mouth on his mouth … :</b> Recalling exactly Eliyyahu’s “measuring himself out” over a similarly dead boy in I Kings 17:21 (note also the parallel in “no sound … no attention” in v.31 and the expanded phrase in I Kings 18:29).
Ii Kings 4:12,"<b>bent over:</b> Long, quoting Jonas Greenfield, suggests “panted/breathed heavily over.” <b>sneezed:</b> A clear sign of life, with the “magical” number seven attached for good measure. This is the only sneeze mentioned in the Hebrew Bible."
Ii Kings 4:13,"<b>field gourds:</b> Cogan/Tadmor identify these as “bitter apples,” consumption of which could be fatal. The “field” part can be understood as “wild” (Gray). <b>[enough] to fill his garment:</b> Cogan/Tadmor: “a skirt-full.”"
Ii Kings 4:14,<b>poured out … cried out:</b> Heb. <i>va-yitzku … tzaaku</i>.
Ii Kings 4:15,"<b>meal:</b> Regular, as opposed to fine, flour. <b>evil:</b> Or “harmful.”"
Ii Kings 4:16,"<b>Baal Shalisha:</b> Probably located in the hill-country of Effrayim, in Binyaminite territory. <b>ears of fresh grain:</b> Others, “fresh grain in his bag,” but a Ugaritic cognate supports the present rendering (Cogan/Tadmor)."
Ii Kings 4:17,"<b>How can I give this:</b> How will it last? More elegant here and in the next verse would be “place,” but the Hebrew root usually rendered “give” forms a refrain here."
Ii Kings 5:1,"<b>Naaman:</b> Pronounced <i>nah-ah-MAHN</i>. From a common Semitic root meaning “pleasant.” <b>lifted up of face:</b> Respected, “high in his favor” (JPS). <b>mighty-one of valor:</b> Omitted in LXX. <b><i>tzaraat:</i></b> For centuries translated as “leprosy,” the dreaded Hansen’s disease, but modern scholars understand it as some sort of unsightly but not contagious or serious skin rash. The strong negativity it invokes (see Lev. 13–14) may be due to the common visual deterioration and hence the suggestion of death, which was the great ritual pollutant in the Bible."
Ii Kings 5:2,"<b>She said … he would cure him:</b> A young girl knows what the great general does not. <b>cure him:</b> Lit., “gather him back” into society."
Ii Kings 5:3,"<b>[which] said:</b> Lit., “saying.”"

Ii Kings 5:5,<b>know:</b> Or “acknowledge.”

Ii Kings 5:8,"<b>if I should accept [anything] … !:</b> Typically, there is to be no profit for the prophet."

Ii Kings 6:4,
Ii Kings 6:5,<b>that the iron [ax head]:</b> Heb. unclear; LXX adds “here.…”

Ii Kings 6:11,<b>dazzling-light:</b> Just as the evildoers of Sodom were struck by God in Gen. 19:11.
Ii Kings 6:12,"<b>This:</b> Instead of <i>zeh</i>, the standard word for “this” in biblical Hebrew, the text makes use of <i>zo</i>, an Aramaism."
Ii Kings 6:13,<b>Father:</b> A term of respect; Elisha had employed it in addressing Eliyyahu in Chap. 2.
Ii Kings 6:14,"<b>a great spread:</b> Or “feast,” based on the Akkadian <i>kiretu</i>. The Hebrew word (<i>kera</i>) occurs only here in the Bible."
Ii Kings 6:15,<b>until … :</b> Spelling out the anticipated effects of the siege. <b>donkey’s head:</b> They would be forced by circumstances to eat ritually forbidden animals (Kimhi). <b>“pigeons’ dung”:</b> Usually understood as the name of a plant.
Ii Kings 6:16,"<b>on the wall:</b> The double (casemate) wall of the city, and hence wide enough to walk on top of (as one can on the present, Ottoman-period wall of Jerusalem’s Old City). <b>cried out:</b> The technical legal term for lodging an appeal with the king (Cogan/Tadmor), also used in 8:3. <b>Save:</b> Others, “help.”"

Ii Kings 6:18,<b>tore his garments … sackcloth was on his flesh:</b> As a sign of mourning or repentance.

Ii Kings 7:3,"<b>fall away:</b> That is, desert."
Ii Kings 7:4,"<b>entered … ate … entered … :</b> The string of verbs, as so often in the Bible, emphasizes “speed and purpose” (Cohn 2000)."
Ii Kings 7:5,<b>iniquity will find us:</b> We will be punished for delaying delivering the news to the king. <b>find:</b> Or “overtake.”
Ii Kings 7:6,"<b>five:</b> The number sometimes indicates “a few” (JPS). <b>they are like the whole throng … :</b> The verse is garbled, with an entire phrase virtually repeated. <b>see:</b> Or “find out” (JPS)."
Ii Kings 7:7,<b>their fearful-haste:</b> MT has an extra letter <i>het</i> here; the <i>Qere</i> reads correctly.

Ii Kings 8:5,<b>to him: / You will live:</b> Ancient versions and manuscripts read this as “not”—“You will not live”—showing that later transmitters of the text were uncomfortable with the idea that a prophet might practice deception.
Ii Kings 8:6,"<b>He kept his face still:</b> The text here may mean that Elisha stares at the king. <b>until he was ashamed:</b> It seems to be the king who is embarrassed by the stare. The phrase may also be idiomatic for “a long while.” Similarly, Moshe is “shamefully-late” coming down from Sinai in Exod. 32:1."
Ii Kings 8:7,<b>such a great thing:</b> Such major devastation.
Ii Kings 8:8,<b>he took:</b> Questions abound here. Is “he” Hazael or the king? Is this an act of succor or murder? (Cogan/Tadmor).

Ii Kings 9:9,<b>Navot:</b> See I Kings .
Ii Kings 9:10,"<b>whorings:</b> The sexual metaphor is a common one in the Bible, referring to Israel’s worshipping of idols; see its use especially in the prophetic book of Hosea."
Ii Kings 9:11,<b>reversed his hands:</b> See note to I Kings 22:34.
Ii Kings 9:12,<b>filled his hand with the bow:</b> Meaning either simply “drew the bow” (so JPS) or “to full stretch” (so Gray 1970).
Ii Kings 9:13,"<b>Bidkar:</b> Ironically here, Heb. <i>d-k-r</i> means “to pierce,” so this officer is perhaps the original Captain Pierce. <b>pronouncement:</b> Gray (1970): “oracle.”"
Ii Kings 9:14,<b>the Utterance of Y<small>HWH</small>:</b> A common prophetic formula.
Ii Kings 9:15,"<b>Bet-Ha-Gan:</b> Probably modern Jenin, a few miles south of Jezreel. <b>… in the chariot … :</b> In MT, the accents connect this phrase with “He struck him down.” In any event, there are clearly words missing here; Cogan/Tadmor add “They shot him.” <b>Yivle’am:</b> A fortified, strategically important site guarding the southern end of the Jezreel Valley.

Ii Kings 10:2,<b>city:</b> Ancient versions and manuscripts read the word in the plural.
Ii Kings 10:3,"<b>select:</b> Another meaning of Heb. <i>r-’-h</i>, usually translated here as “to see.” A notable example is Gen. 22:8, “God will see-for-himself to [or: select] the lamb for the offering-up.” <b>brightest:</b> Heb. is literally “rightest.”"
Ii Kings 10:4,"<b>heads:</b> A double meaning, leaders and physical heads, might be suggested here. <b>bring them:</b> So versions; MT has “come.”"
Ii Kings 10:5,"<b>fall:</b> That is, remain unfulfilled."
Ii Kings 10:6,"<b>great-ones:</b> Nobles. LXX reads Heb. <i>gedolav</i> as <i>go’alav</i>, “blood-redeemers” or relatives. <b>intimates:</b> So JPS, Cogan/Tadmor. Others, “acquaintances.”"
Ii Kings 10:7,"<b>binding house:</b> Or “meeting house,” or even simply a place-name, “Bet-’Eked.”"

Note that <i>b</i> and <i>v</i> are orthographically the same letter in Hebrew. <b>Give me your hand!:</b> MT doesn’t specify the speaker, but most read it as implying Yehu, as does the “he pulled” that follows."

Ii Kings 10:15,<b>apparel:</b> With the possible implication of special clothing.
Ii Kings 10:16,"<b>[left them] thrown [there]:</b> Left their corpses lying there exposed (Cogan/Tadmor). <b>rear-chamber:</b> August Klostermann (quoted in Cogan/Tadmor) emends <i>’ir</i>, “city,” to <i>devir</i> here, signifying the interior of the temple of Baal."

Ii Kings 11:8,<b>right … left:</b> South … north.
Ii Kings 11:9,"<b>the insignia:</b> In their discussion, Cogan / Tadmor lay out the spectrum from “jewels” to the usual “testimony”; clearly some kind of symbolic object connected to the covenant is meant."
Ii Kings 11:10,"<b>Landed People:</b> An oft-debated term, Heb. <i>am ha-aretz</i> is found frequently in this literature, perhaps indicating landholders, or what we might call citizens. Their function in Kings seems to include choosing the king in unstable circumstances such as a coup. In later centuries the phrase came to signify the “salt of the earth,” the working poor, and eventually, the ignorant. <b>tore … called out:</b> Heb. <i>vatikra’</i>, with the first word ending with <i>ayin</i> and the second with <i>alef</i>, so an analogy (but not a repetition) of sound is meant to catch the ear (Cohn 2000)."

Ii Kings 12:11,"<b><i>asham</i>-offerings:</b> Sacrifices designed to make reparations for sin (sometimes with the meaning of “penalty”); see Lev. 5. <b><i>hattat</i>-offerings:</b> These were decontamination or purification sacrifices, intended to effect atonement for sin.

Ii Kings 12:13,"<b>Bet-Millo … Silla:</b> The first term is possibly part of the defense works of the city, the second, less clear—perhaps a street or district close by."
Ii Kings 12:14,"<b>Yozakhar:</b> Trad. English “Jozakar.” The name means “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Called to Mind.” This is the reading of manuscripts, since MT has “Yozavad”—improbable given that “Yehozavad” is the other person’s name here. Yehozavad means “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Given.” <b>servants:</b> It is not clear whether courtiers or soldiers are meant here (Gray 1970). <b>Amatzya:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Is Strong”; trad. English “Amaziah.”"
Ii Kings 13:1,<b>Yehoahaz:</b> Pronounced <i>ye-ho-ah-HAZ;</i> it means “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Grasped.” Trad. English “Jehoahaz.”
Ii Kings 13:2,"<b>sin:</b> MT has plural “sins,” but that conflicts with the subsequent “it.”"
Ii Kings 13:3,<b>for all the days:</b> For a long time.
Ii Kings 13:4,"<b>in their tents:</b> The Israelites certainly dwelt in houses by this period; the phrase may simply be an older idiom for “peacefully” (Cogan/Tadmor). <b>as yesterday [and] the day-before:</b> A biblical idiom for “in the past.” “Day-before” is literally “day three [ago],” where today is the first in the sequence, and yesterday the second."
Ii Kings 13:5,<b>Father! Father! … :</b> Elisha’s own words to his master Eliyyahu at their parting in 2:12.
Ii Kings 13:6,<b>Have your hand mount:</b> A technical term for grasping a bow.
Ii Kings 13:7,<b>Afek:</b> Cogan/Tadmor identify this particular Afek with a site east of the Sea of Galilee (see I Kings 20:26ff.).
Ii Kings 13:8,<b>Strike the ground:</b> With the arrows.
Ii Kings 13:9,"<b>Striking five or six times:</b> Ancient versions read, “Would that you had struck …”"
Ii Kings 13:10,"<b>at the coming of the year:</b> JPS reads “every year”; I emend, with others, from <i>ba’</i> to <i>b-vo’</i>."
Ii Kings 13:11,<b>they were burying:</b> The natives. <b>went off:</b> MT has singular.
Ii Kings 13:12,<b>until now:</b> Indicating that this text came into being before the time of the Babylonian Exile.
Ii Kings 14:1,<b>Amatzyahu:</b> Trad. English “Amaziah.”
Ii Kings 14:2,<b>Yehoaddan:</b> meaning “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Delight.”
Ii Kings 14:3,<b>removed:</b> LXX; MT has “turned aside.”
Ii Kings 14:4,"<b>as is written:</b> In Deut. 24:1. <b>the Record of the Instruction of Moshe:</b> Heb. <i>sefer torat moshe</i>. The reference is probably to the core of the book of Deuteronomy, either in its reality or in the perspective of a later redactor of Kings."
Ii Kings 14:5,"<b>Valley of Salt:</b> Identification unclear. <b>the Boulder:</b> Thought by LXX to refer to the famous site of Petra in today’s Jordan, its location is not known with certainty."
Ii Kings 14:6,"<b>at home:</b> Lit., “in your house.” <b>stir up evil:</b> Or “flirt with disaster” (Cohn 2000)."
Ii Kings 14:7,<b>Bet-Shemesh that belongs to Judah:</b> Cogan/Tadmor cite earlier scholars who see this phrase as indicating a northern origin for the passage.
Ii Kings 14:8,"<b>Efrayim Gate:</b> In the center of Jerusalem’s northern wall, the main spot of Jerusalem’s vulnerability historically. <b>Corner Gate:</b> In the northwest corner of the city wall."
Ii Kings 14:9,<b>Yorov’am:</b> The Second.
Ii Kings 14:10,"<b>fifteen years:</b> The chronology does not work here, given the twenty-nine-year figure for Ahazyahu’s reign. This is another indication of the difficulties in squaring the historical record in Kings, perhaps because of differing source material."
Ii Kings 14:11,"<b>Lakhish:</b> Trad. English “Lachish,” the great fortified city in the lowlands of Judah, west of Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 14:12,<b>all the people:</b> An exaggeration; perhaps equal to “the Landed People.”
Ii Kings 14:13,"<b>Elat:</b> Pronounced <i>ay-LAHT</i>. The Etzyon-Gever of I Kings 9:26 and :49, and II Kings 16:6, and today a popular resort city on the Gulf of Aqaba."
Ii Kings 14:14,"<b>king over Israel:</b> Emending MT’s “Yorov’am king of Israel,” with ancient versions."
Ii Kings 14:15,"<b>the Sea of the Plain:</b> The Dead Sea (so understood by Josh. 3:16 and 12:3). The “Plain” is the Jordan/Rift Valley. <b>Gat Ha-Heyfer:</b> A town in Lower Galilee, on the eastern border of Zevulun’s tribal territory (not far from Sepphoris)."
Ii Kings 14:16,"<b>mighty-deeds:</b> Yorov’am is the last king of Israel (the Northern Kingdom) whose accomplishments are so judged, perhaps indicating Israel’s impotence in the face of Assyria from this point forward. <b>for Israel:</b> Omitting MT’s “for Yehuda and,” along with most scholars."
Ii Kings 14:17,<b>Zekharyahu:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Called to Mind”; trad. English “Zechariah.”
Ii Kings 15:1,"<b>Azarya:</b> Short for “Azaryahu,” meaning “Y<small>HWH</small> Helps.” He is sometimes also called Uzziya (Uzziah), from a similar root meaning “Y<small>HWH</small> Is Strong.” Trad. English “Azariah.”"
Ii Kings 15:2,<b>Yekholyahu:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Prevails”; trad. English “Jecoliah.”
Ii Kings 15:3,"<b>Separate House:</b> Many interpreters read as “House of Separation,” while Kimhi understands the phrase as indicating that Azarya was now “free” of the burdens of office. If the former, the text is pointing to the practice of quarantining those with the skin disease <i>tzaraat</i>, which was thought to convey serious ritual impurity (see Lev. 13–14). <b>Yotam:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-TAHM;</i> trad. English “Jotham,” with the meaning “Y<small>HWH</small> Is Perfect.” See Judg. 9:–21 for a more famous bearer of the name."
Ii Kings 15:4,"<b>Shallum:</b> Pronounced <i>shah-LOOM</i> and meaning perhaps “payback” for a vow (so Gray 1970, who also notes that this king is called “Son of a Nobody” in Assyrian records—confirming his status as usurper). <b>Yivle’am:</b> MT is garbled here, looking somewhat like an Aramaic phrase for “before the people.” I follow LXX, given that another political assassination took place in that location in II Kings 9:27."
Ii Kings 15:5,<b>the word of Y<small>HWH</small> … :</b> See 10:30.
Ii Kings 15:6,"<b>Menahem:</b> “Comforter.” <b>Gadi:</b> Meaning either “Gadite” or “[Y<small>HWH</small> Is] My Fortune.” <b>Tirtza:</b> See note to :17, above."
Ii Kings 15:7,"<b>Tappuah:</b> One manuscript of LXX has this, while another reads it as Tirtza; MT has “Tifsah.” Tappu’ah is fourteen miles southwest of Tirtza, on the Menashe-Efrayim border."
Ii Kings 15:8,"<b>In his days:</b> In its present place at the end of v.18 in printed Bibles, this phrase (Heb. <i>kol yamav</i>) breaks the usual formula associated with Yorov’am. Better, here, is to put it at the beginning of v. and to emend slightly to “in his days” (<i>be-yamav</i>), which it resembles orthographically, and which is a common archival phrase in this literature. <b>Pul:</b> A nickname for Tiglat Pil’eser III (see note to v.29) in late sources (Cohn 2000). <b>to have his hands be with him:</b> I.e., to support him."
Ii Kings 15:9,<b>Pekahya:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Opened [the eyes or the womb].”
Ii Kings 15:10,<b>Remalyahu:</b> Possibly meaning “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Adorned.” <b>Argov and the Aryei:</b> The Hebrew is obscure; the fact that <i>aryei</i> means “lion” does not help much.
Ii Kings 15:11,"<b>Tiglat Pil’eser:</b> Akkadian <i>Tukulti-apil-Esharra</i>, “My Help is the Son of Esharra [the god Ashur],” the third Assyrian king by that name, who ruled from 745 to 727 <small>B.C.E</small>. During his active military career, the Neo-Assyrian Empire reached its maximum expansion. The Hebrew is pronounced <i>tig-LAHT pil-EH-ser</i>. <b>Iyyon:</b> At the base of Mount Hermon. <b>Avel Bet-Maakha:</b> South of the previous town. <b>Yanoah:</b> Of uncertain location. <b>Kedesh:</b> Ten miles north of Hatzor. <b>Iyyon … Hatzor:</b> The five towns mentioned here appear to form a straight north-south line, just to the west of the Jordan River."
Ii Kings 15:12,<b>Hoshe’a:</b> Short for “Y<small>HWH</small> Delivers.”
Ii Kings 15:13,<b>Uziyyahu:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Strength”; trad. English “Uzziah.”
Ii Kings 15:14,<b>Yerusha:</b> “Possession”; trad. English “Jerushah.”
Ii Kings 15:15,<b>Upper Gate:</b> It is not clear where this was.
Ii Kings 15:16,"<b>sent out:</b> Others, “let loose.” Cogan/Tadmor note that the verb is usually used in connection with divine punishment. <b>Retzin:</b> Probably meaning “Desirable.”"
Ii Kings 16:1,
Ii Kings 16:2,
Ii Kings 16:3,<b>had his son cross through the fire:</b> It is not clear whether this was an actual sacrifice or some kind of milder ritual.
Ii Kings 16:4,"<b>Judahites:</b> Cogan/Tadmor see this as a late usage (late seventh century). Several centuries later, the term came to designate “Jews,” a name which barely appears in biblical texts. <b>from Elat:</b> MT has “Elot” here. <b>until this day:</b> Also in 8:22 and 14:7 in reference to territorial changes, this refers to the time of Josiah, not the exile (Cogan/Tadmor)."
Ii Kings 16:5,<b>Kir:</b> Location unknown; it is referred to in Amos :7 as the Arameans’ point of origin.
Ii Kings 16:6,<b>likeness:</b> Or “model.”
Ii Kings 16:7,"<b>he sent-up-in-smoke … :</b> The king is able to act as priest on this occasion, since he is presenting a one-time dedication sacrifice, not a daily one (Cogan/Tadmor)."
Ii Kings 16:8,"<b>his grain-gift:</b> Elsewhere “gift-offering,” but I have tried to cut down on the repetition of “offering” here, since it is not in the Hebrew per se. “His” refers to the king’s sacrifice to God. <b>frequent:</b> Following Cogan/Tadmor."
Ii Kings 16:9,"<b>the covered-passage for the Sabbath:</b> A difficult phrase which could, alternately, mean “the cast-metal seat” which “he removed” (Mulder). <b>on account of … :</b> Because of Tiglat Pil’eser’s plundering (Cogan/Tadmor)."
Ii Kings 16:10,"<b>Hizkiyyahu:</b> Pronounced <i>hiz-kee-YAH-hu</i>, meaning “Y<small>HWH</small> Was Strong.” The name Ezekiel (Yehezke’el) derives from the same Hebrew root. The trad. English is “Hezekiah.”"
Ii Kings 17:1,
Ii Kings 17:2,
Ii Kings 17:3,"<b>Against him … came up:</b> Heb. <i>’alav ’ala</i>, suggesting perhaps a heightened rhetoric, fitting for the introduction to such a dramatic moment in Israel’s history. <b>Shalman’eser:</b> Assyrian <i>Shalmanu asharedu</i>, “[The God] Shalman Is Exalted.” Sargon II is also mentioned in Assyrian records as the conqueror of Shomeron. <b>servant:</b> More of a technical term here connoting “vassal.”"
Ii Kings 17:4,<b>to So:</b> The name is not otherwise attested as the name of an Egyptian king; Cogan/Tadmor conjecture “To Sais (a place name) [to] the king of Egypt.” <b>arrested … bound … over:</b> Heb. <i>va-ya’tzereihu … va-ya’asreihu</i>.
Ii Kings 17:5,<b>Halah … the Havor … Gozan:</b> Known locations in Assyria.
Ii Kings 17:6,<b>every prophet:</b> MT spelling of “prophet” is garbled; this may be a gloss.
Ii Kings 17:7,"<b>hardened their neck:</b> See Exod. 32:9, where God characterizes the Israelites by the same image."
Ii Kings 17:8,<b>rejected:</b> With the flavor of “despised.”
Ii Kings 17:9,"<b>the Forces of the Heavens:</b> Or “Armies of the Heavens,” here denoting the planets and stars. The worship of heavenly bodies was common throughout the ancient Near East."
Ii Kings 17:10,"<b>removed:</b> Heb. <i>hesir</i>, punning on <i>saru</i>, “turn aside,” in the previous verse."
Ii Kings 17:11,<b>from Babylon … :</b> Apparently from all over the empire—a known Assyrian practice.
Ii Kings 17:12,"<b>sent out:</b> or “let loose.” <b>lions:</b> As earlier in the book (I 13:24), sent by God to punish people in the Bible. The Hebrew word, <i>arayot</i>, echoes the key verb <i>y-r-’</i>, “hold in awe,” as well as the term “instruct” (<i>y-r-k</i>) in v.27."
Ii Kings 17:13,<b>practices:</b> In the sense of “religious practices.” Cogan/Tadmor translate as “rites.”
Ii Kings 17:14,<b>Shomeronites:</b> The Assyrians designated the entire province as Shomeron (Gray 1970).
Ii Kings 17:15,"<b>Sukkot Benot … :</b> Some of these gods are known, while others seem to be fragments of names. <b>Ashima:</b> Gray (1970) theorizes that this is the goddess Ashera, transformed into an Aramaic word for “guilt.”"
Ii Kings 17:16,"<b>Adrammelekh … Anammelekh:</b> The rhyme is striking, but the names are so far not known in ancient Near Eastern pantheons."
Ii Kings 17:17,<b>whose name he appointed:</b> See note to Judg. 8:31.
Ii Kings 17:18,"<b>until this day:</b> Here, as often in this book, the phrase appears to refer to a time before the destruction of Judah."
Ii Kings 18:1,
Ii Kings 18:2,
Ii Kings 18:3,
Ii Kings 18:4,"<b>Viper of Copper:</b> Literally, a snake of bronze, Heb. <i>nehash ha-nehoshet</i>. Biblical Hebrew does not differentiate between copper and its alloys (Zevit 2004). See Num. 21:4–9, where Moshe is commanded to counter a plague of snakes by hanging one made out of bronze on a standard, for those afflicted to look at and be healed. According to our passage, it had been preserved and was apparently worshipped."
Ii Kings 18:5,<b>wherever he went out:</b> Equivalent to “in all that he did.”
Ii Kings 18:6,<b>led them off:</b> Some versions read “settled them.”
Ii Kings 18:7,<b>crossed:</b> Violated.
Ii Kings 18:8,"<b>Sanheriv:</b> Pronounced <i>sahn-hay-REEV;</i> trad. English “Sennacherib,” Assyrian <i>Sin-ahhe-eriba</i>, “[The God] Sin Compensated for [Dead] Brothers.”"
Ii Kings 18:9,<b>sinned:</b> Or “given offense.”
Ii Kings 18:10,"<b>posts:</b> A rare Hebrew word, probably from the root <i>’-m-n</i>, denoting “firmness” or “support” (Cogan/Tadmor). <b>king of Judah:</b> The inclusion of the title and name seem unnecessary here."
Ii Kings 18:11,"<b>Field-Marshal:</b> The Heb. <i>tartan</i> probably derives from the Assyrian <i>turtanu</i>. <b>weighty:</b> Or “massive.” <b>Washer’s Field:</b> See note to I 1:9. It is usually translated as “Fuller’s Field”; at this location, near the spring of En-Rogel at the southern tip of Jerusalem, sheep’s wool would be cleaned."
Ii Kings 18:12,<b>Elyakim:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Will Fulfill.” <b>Shevna:</b> Trad. English “Shebna.” <b>Yoah:</b> Pronounced <i>yo-AH;</i> “Y<small>HWH</small> Is Kinsman.”
Ii Kings 18:13,<b>Hizkiyyahu:</b> The omission of “King” here feels like a deliberate insult (Cohn 2000). <b>the Great King:</b> The usual title for the king in Assyrian usage.
Ii Kings 18:14,<b>is it not he … :</b> Cohn (2000) sees this verse as a retrojection from the time of Yoshiyyahu (Josiah); see Chap. 23 below.
Ii Kings 18:15,"<b>governor:</b> The construction of the whole phrase is awkward, and so this Akkadian word, <i>pahat</i>, may be considered a gloss (Cogan/Tadmor), and is often omitted."
Ii Kings 18:16,"<b>And now:</b> The “and,” part of the usual construction, is in some manuscripts but not in MT."
Ii Kings 18:17,"<b>Aramaic:</b> Beginning around this time, Aramaic became the diplomatic language of the western Near East, lasting for centuries. It later became the main language of Jews (through the Roman era), and survived in classical Jewish texts such as the Talmud and some prayers, as well as the standard form of the marriage contract. It is also still actively spoken, independent of Jews, in some areas of the Middle East. <b>Judean:</b> The language later known as Hebrew."
Ii Kings 18:18,<b>filth … “water of their legs”:</b> <i>Qere</i> euphemisms for excrement and urine.
Ii Kings 18:19,"<b>my:</b> According to ancient versions, including LXX; MT has “his.”"
Ii Kings 18:20,"<b>Make me a blessing-gift:</b> Heb. <i>berakha</i>, most often “blessing,” can sometimes mean “gift,” as in Gen. 33:11. Cogan/Tadmor see the construction here (with “make”) as deriving from Akkadian usage, and others have remarked on the Assyrian flavor of the speech. <b>vine … fig tree:</b> Ironically playing on the ultimate description of peace and security in I Kings 5:5 (under Shelomo). At the same time, Cogan/Tadmor point out that, as part of their resettlement policy, the Assyrians had to treat their captives well."
Ii Kings 18:21,"<b>Hamat … Arpad … Shomeron:</b> In fact, these cities were conquered earlier in the century, by other kings (Cogan/Tadmor). Based on the LXX and Isa. 36:19, a phrase (“And where are the gods of the region of Shomeron?”) may be missing here."
Ii Kings 19:1,
Ii Kings 19:2,"<b>Yesha’yahu:</b> Pronounced <i>ye-shah-YAH-hu</i>, “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Delivered,” the great prophet (English: Isaiah) whose book follows Kings in the Hebrew Bible."
Ii Kings 19:3,"<b>to mock the Living God:</b> The language echoes the David and Golyat (Goliath) story in I Sam. 17—or was that one perhaps cast in Assyrian costume? See the Commentary there, and also v.16 here. <b>give rebuke:</b> Or “punish” (Gray 1970). <b>lift up a prayer:</b> Or “make intercession.” <b>the remnant:</b> Jerusalem."
Ii Kings 19:4,<b>hearsay:</b> Or “rumor.”
Ii Kings 19:5,<b>returned:</b> Cogan/Tadmor have “withdrew.” <b>Livna:</b> Somewhere in the lowlands of Judah (see :22).
Ii Kings 19:6,"<b>He heard:</b> The king of Assyria. <b>Tirhaka:</b> According to Assyrian records, he actually succeeded to the throne a bit later, in 60. <b>Kush:</b> Ethiopia."
Ii Kings 19:7,<b>Gozan … :</b> The places mentioned here are all areas of Assyria. <b>Harran:</b> The famous crossroads town (its literal meaning) from where Avraham (Abraham) and his family depart for Canaan in Gen. 11.
Ii Kings 19:8,"<b>letter:</b> MT has plural, which does not fit the second half of the sentence; I follow ancient versions."
Ii Kings 19:9,"<b>put their gods to the fire:</b> Not a reflection of the usual Assyrian practice, which was to tolerate other religions; so the verse is probably a polemic (Cogan/Tadmor)."
Ii Kings 19:10,<b>concerning:</b> Heb. <i>’al</i> can also be understood as “against” (Cohn 2000).
Ii Kings 19:11,"<b>short-armed:</b> Powerless. <b>straw of the rooftops:</b> Grain was usually processed on the flat Israelite rooftops. <b>before the east wind:</b> Heb. <i>qdym</i>, the reading in the Dead Sea Isaiah Scroll, which is clearly more correct than MT’s <i>qmh</i>, “standing grain.”"
Ii Kings 19:12,"<b>[yes], and your raging against me:</b> Probably a dittography, where a scribe erroneously repeated a phrase that he had just written down."
Ii Kings 19:13,"<b>roaring:</b> This according to ancient versions and later commentators, who read Heb. <i>shaanankha</i>, “complacency,” as <i>she’onkhato</i>. <b>hook … bridle:</b> A form of humiliation depicted on Assyrian monuments (Cogan/Tadmor)."
Ii Kings 19:14,"<b>the sign:</b> Namely, Y<small>HWH</small> will still provide food, despite the devastating Assyrian invasion."
Ii Kings 19:15,<b>struck down:</b> Apparently in a plague.
Ii Kings 19:16,"<b>marched off:</b> Lit. “pulled up [stakes],” the physical act of pulling out the tent pegs for travel."
Ii Kings 19:17,"<b>Nisrokh:</b> Not a known divine name, so possibly a miscopying of another name. It may be intentional (Cogan/Tadmor). <b>Adrammelekh and Sar’etzer:</b> Ironic Hebraized names (“Glorious King” and “Protect the Ruler”). According to Assyrian records, Sanheriv was assassinated by another individual, some twenty years after the siege of Jerusalem. The Bible nevertheless closely connects the two events, in classic Deuteronomistic fashion. <b>Ararat:</b> Armenia. <b>Esar-haddon:</b> Akkadian <i>Ashur-ah-iddina</i>, “[The god] Ashur Has Given a Brother.”"
Ii Kings 20:1,"<b>Charge your household:</b> That is, give them final instructions."
Ii Kings 20:2,<b>turned his face to the wall:</b> See note to I Kings 1:4.
Ii Kings 20:3,<b>walked about before you:</b> Followed God’s will; see the same expression regarding Avraham in Gen. 17:1.
Ii Kings 20:4,<b>middle courtyard:</b> Between the palace and the Temple.
Ii Kings 20:5,"<b><i>Nagid:</i></b> See note to I Kings 1:3. Since the term has not been used from I Kings 14:7 until now, it is clear that Hizkiyyahu is being singled out in a positive way. <b>the third day:</b> Either because he was healed or because he was now ritually purified."
Ii Kings 20:6,<b>figs … boil:</b> It was widely believed that figs had curative properties. <b>lived:</b> Recovered.
Ii Kings 20:7,<b>shadow:</b> On a sundial.
Ii Kings 20:8,<b>easy for the shadow:</b> Heb. <i>nakeil la-tzeil</i>.
Ii Kings 20:9,"<b>At [about] that time:</b> Scholars have noted that this phrase is an editorial device, connecting originally independent sections. <b>Merodakh Bal’adan:</b> According to some versions and manuscripts; MT has “Berodakh Bal’adan.” The name in Akkadian is <i>Marduk-apla-iddina</i>, “[The God] Marduk Gave the Inheriting Son.” This foe of Assyria reigned from 722 to 710 and again from 704 to 703."
Ii Kings 20:10,"<b>was pleased with them:</b> Following versions and Isa. 39:2, with <i>s-m-h</i> replacing MT’s <i>sh-m-’</i>, “heard about them.” <b>them:</b> Presumably the messengers from the Babylonian king. <b>storehouse:</b> Heb. <i>[bet] nekhot</i>, a loan word from Akkadian."
Ii Kings 20:11,"<b>sons who have issued from you:</b> Idiomatically, “your offspring” (Cogan/Tadmor)."
Ii Kings 20:12,<b>trustworthy:</b> Secure.
Ii Kings 20:13,"<b>the pool and the channel:</b> The famous Siloam Tunnel, in which workers dug a third of a mile through rock from the Gihon Spring (outside of Jerusalem’s city wall to the east) to a pool which would supply water to the city in time of siege. A contemporary inscription chronicling the completion of the work has survived, and was uncovered in 1880."
Ii Kings 21:1,<b>Menashe:</b> Pronounced <i>meh-nah-SHEH;</i> trad. English “Manasseh.” The meaning seems to be “He Who Makes Forget” (the name of one of Yosef’s [Joseph’s] sons; see Gen. 41:51). <b>Heftzi-va:</b> Pronounced <i>hef-tzee-VAH</i>. It means “My Delight Is in Her”; trad. English “Hephzibah.”
Ii Kings 21:2,"<b>sacrificial-altars:</b> LXX has the singular here.
4–6 <b>he built … he had his son cross … made:</b> The form of the Hebrew verbs here points to archival style; to indicate a difference from the customary phraseology, I have omitted some “and”s before these verbs (see Gray 1970, following Montgomery)."
Ii Kings 21:3,<b>he built sacrificial-altars:</b> To whom? Perhaps something is missing here; JPS adds “to them.”
Ii Kings 21:4,"<b>son:</b> LXX has “sons.” <b>divination:</b> Foretelling the future, often through use of techniques involving shapes in water or metal. <b>ghosts:</b> The Hebrew word (sing, <i>’ov</i>) derives from a pit where ghosts are summoned. It and “all-knowing ones” are used to describe both them and those who deal with them. <b>all-knowing ones:</b> Spirits."
Ii Kings 21:5,<b>Amorites:</b> Often used as a general designation for Canaanites.
Ii Kings 21:6,<b>ring:</b> See I Sam. 3:11 for the same disaster terminology.
Ii Kings 21:7,<b>measuring-line … plumb-bob … as one wipes a dish dean:</b> Cogan/Tadmor note the irony of using images of construction and satiation to point to ruin and disaster.
Ii Kings 21:8,<b>end:</b> See note to 10:21. <b>his sin by which he caused Judah to sin:</b> A measure of Menashe’s low “rating” is this verbal comparison to the much-vilified northern king Yorov’am I.
Ii Kings 21:9,"<b>in the garden:</b> After Hizkiyyahu, Judean kings were no longer buried in the City of David, for lack of space (Cogan/Tadmor). <b>the garden of Uzza:</b> Benjamin Mazar takes this to be Siloam (Cogan/Tadmor). <b>Amon:</b> Ironically, the name means “Faithful.”"

Ii Kings 21:11,<b>[and all]:</b> Inserted by ancient manuscripts and LXX.

Ii Kings 22:3,"<b>Hilkiyyahu:</b> Pronounced <i>hil-kee-YAH-hu</i>. “Y<small>HWH</small> Is My Portion”; trad. English “Hilkiah.” Some have suggested that he is identical to the father of the prophet Jeremiah, although the latter’s family came from Anatot, and seem not to have been serving as priests any longer. <b>Great Priest:</b> High Priest."
Ii Kings 22:4,<b>accountable:</b> Those who hired the actual workers (Cogan/Tadmor).

Ii Kings 23:2,"<b>men of Judah:</b> Cogan/Tadmor see this as an anachronistic term inserted here; it could thus be rendered “fighting-men of Judah.” <b>great and small:</b> Lit., “from small to great”; others, “from oldest to youngest.”"
Ii Kings 23:3,"<b>the king stood by the standing-column:</b> See, similarly, 11:14. Perhaps this was a symbolic act of some kind. <b>took a stand in:</b> Possibly meaning “agreed to.”"

Ii Kings 23:6,<b>[male] prostitutes:</b> See note to I Kings 14:24. <b>women … weaving:</b> Coverings for statues of gods are known elsewhere in the ancient Near East. This is apparently one of the few tasks which actively included women at Israelite sanctuaries.

Ii Kings 23:9,"<b>Valley of Ben Hinnom:</b> Pronounced <i>ben hee-NOHM</i>. It was directly south of the present Old City walls.

Ii Kings 23:21,"<b>Yehoahaz:</b> Pronounced <i>ye-ho-ah-HAZ</i>, “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Seized”; trad. English “Jehoahaz.” The name is another form of the previously encountered “Ahazyahu.” Apparently this was a regnal name, since formerly his name was Shallum. <b>anointed:</b> Said of only two other kings, Shelomo in I Kings 1:45 and Yehoash in II Kings 11:12. In Kimhi’s view, this was necessary because of the abnormality of succession in each case."
Ii Kings 23:22,<b>Yirmeyahu:</b> “Y<small>HWH</small> Has Founded.” It is the same name as that of the famous prophet (Jeremiah) who was alive at the time.

Ii Kings 25:4,"<b>[fled]:</b> See Jer. 39:. <b>he went:</b> Presumably, the king. <b>Road of the Plain:</b> Or “Arava Road,” which goes through the Jordan Valley. To get to this north-south route, the king had to descend eastward to Jericho, which he barely reached before being captured."
Ii Kings 25:5,"<b>the Plains of Jericho:</b> Thus the last king of Israel/Judah is captured in the same vicinity that the Israelites had entered the land at the beginning of the Early Prophets, in Joshua (Sweeney 2007)."
Ii Kings 25:6,"<b>blinded:</b> The normal punishment for a rebellious slave throughout the ancient Near East (Cogan/Tadmor). <b>they bound him with double-bronze:</b> The same fate, along with the blinding, was meted out to Shimshon by the Philistines in Judg. 16:21. <b>brought him to Babylon:</b> So the last king of Israel/Judah does not receive the dignity of the usual death formula in Kings (Cohn 2000).

Ii Kings 25:7,"<b>Nevuzar’adan:</b> Pronounced <i>ne-vu-zar-ah-DAHN;</i> Akkadian <i>Nabu-zer-iddina</i>, “Nabu has given me offspring.” <b>Captain of the Guard:</b> Lit., “Chief Cook,” a title like “Chief Cupbearer,” whose duties went well beyond their original named function."

Ii Kings 25:16,"<b>Mitzpa:</b> Eight miles north of Jerusalem—but according to the archaeological record, it was unscathed by the capital’s fall (Cogan/Tadmor). Zevit (2004) notes the irony of this site being associated with the very beginnings of the monarchy, in Sha’ul’s territory. <b>Yishmael:</b> “God Has Hearkened.” Trad.

English translations render the name as “Evil Merodach,” with unintentional negative connotations. In biblical Hebrew, though, <i>ehvil</i> does happen to mean “foolish.” <b>lifted up the head:</b> Pardoned, as happened to Pharaoh’s chief cupbearer in Gen. 40:13. LXX adds “and brought him out.” <b>from the prison house:</b> Preceded in LXX and Jer. 52:32 by “and took him out of.”"
