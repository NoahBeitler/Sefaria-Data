Ovyut,opacity,Opacity,עׇבְיוּת,,,"<i>Ovyut</i> denotes thickness, materiality, or darkness, as opposed to purity, clarity, and spirituality. In kabbalistic terminology, it expresses the quality of the vessel, which is the will to receive. It is considered thick and dark because it is the antithesis of the eternal divine light, the essence of which is entirely giving. A greater will to receive is regarded as having greater opacity, while a vessel that contains a lesser will to receive is regarded as being more pure. This is because the greater the will to receive that a vessel acquires, the more it is distanced from the Creator and His light and the more material and dark it becomes.",111,

At the end of every volume there is a question-and-answer section that provides a clear summary of its concepts and ideas. <i>Talmud Eser HaSefirot</i> was published between 1933 and 1937.",71,
Shefa,,,שֶׁפַע,,,"Often translated as bounty, flow, or abundance, <i>shefa</i> comes from the Hebrew word <i>hashpa’a</i>, which in this context means to give. Rays of sunlight, for example, can be described as the sun’s <i>shefa</i>. The rays constitute a “flow” of light from the sun that provides light and sustenance to the earth in bountiful abundance. In kabbalistic thought, <i>shefa </i> refers to different forms of light that flow from God's essence or from the <<<i>sefirot</i>>> and the like. Additionally, <i>shefa</i> can be used to refer both to God’s giving to creation, as well as the giving of created beings to each other.",101,

Sefira,emanation,"sefirot, vessel",סְפִירָה,סְפִירוֹת,,"The <i>sefirot</i> represent ten ways through which the Creator reveals Himself in the creation, with each <i>sefira</i> representing a different degree of revelation. The term <i>sefira</i> itself has the same root as the word sapir, which means sapphire or radiance, indicating that the divine light is contained within the <i>sefirot</i> and illuminates the creation through them.<br>Generally, there are ten <i>sefirot</i>: <<</i>Keter</i>>>, <<</i>Ḥokhma</i>>>, <<</i>Bina</i>>>, <<</i>Ḥesed</i>>>, <<</i>Gevura</i>>>, <<</i>Tiferet</i>>>, <<</i>Netzaḥ</i>>>, <<</i>Hod</i>>>, <<</i>Yesod</i>>>, and <<</i>Malkhut</i>>>. But in essence there are five primary <i>sefirot</i>: <<</i>Keter</i>>>, <<</i>Ḥokhma</i>>>, <<</i>Bina</i>>>, <<</i>Tiferet</i>>>, and <<</i>Malkhut</i>>>. Additionally, each of these five <i>sefirot</i> are themselves composed of the other <i>sefirot</i>, since everything in reality is formed out of <i>sefirot</i>.

The reason the sefirot are given different names is that a different kind of light from that of the other <i>sefirot</i>, called the “light of giving,” is revealed through <<</i>Tiferet</i>>>. Although they are named differently, they are still, in a sense, the same five <i>sefirot</i> mentioned above. Thus, <<</i>Ḥesed</i>>> is referred to as the <<</i>Keter</i>>> of <<</i>Tiferet</i>>>, <<</i>Gevura</i>>> as the <<</i>Ḥokhma</i>>> of <<</i>Tiferet</i>>>, <<</i>Tiferet</i>>> as the <<</i>Bina</i>>> of <<</i>Tiferet</i>>>, <<</i>Netzaḥ</i>>> as the <<</i>Tiferet</i>>> of <<</i>Tiferet</i>>>, and <<</i>Hod</i>>> as the <<</i>Malkhut</i>>> of <<</i>Tiferet</i>>>.

When <i>Keter</i> is regarded as part of the system, it is the highest part of the <<head>>, which is comprised of the first three <<levels>>: <i>Keter</i>, <<Ḥokhma>>, and <<<i>Bina</i>>>.

Bina,Understanding,,בִּינָה,,,"<i>Bina</i> is the third of the ten <<<i>sefirot</i>>>, following the <<<i>sefira</i>>> of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>. It is the second <<level>> of the supernal light, or direct light, that emanates from the essence of the Creator. This second <<level>> or phase represents the desire of the created being to give and bestow and is therefore called the light of giving, as a continuation of the light of the Creator, the light of wisdom. It is called <i>Bina</i> or Understanding, because from it flows forth the power of understanding, of apprehending one thing for another. <i>Bina</i> is also a reference to different lower <<levels>> or <i>sefirot</i> in the structure of reality that are derivatives of the second <<level>> of the direct light.<br><i>Bina</i> is considered a “female” (or receiving) <i>sefira</i>, because it receives the light of wisdom. Additionally, at the root of <i>Bina</i> lies the yearning of the created beings that represents the will to receive that is embedded in existence.

This integration, which can be thought of as being formed of two columns of light, as well as an intermediating column which connects them, is the harmonious beauty of this <i>sefira</i>. It is this integrative capacity and its unique combination of lights that gives <i>Tiferet</i> its unique characterization in which the five <i>sefirot</i> that comprise it are given different names (recall that each <i>sefira</i> is formed of all five <i>sefirot</i>): The <<<i>Keter</i>>> in <i>Tiferet</i> is called <<<i>Ḥesed</i>>>.

The other meaning of <i>Ein Sof</i> is a “relative” <i>Ein Sof</i>, which is the <<<i>Keter</i>>> of each <<level>> of reality, because in relation to the <<levels>> beneath it, <<<i>Keter</i>>> is regarded as absolute light, without vessel or limitation. Thus, for example, the world of <<<i>Adam Kadmon</i>>> is defined as <i>Ein Sof</i> in relation to the worlds of <<<i>Atzilut</i>>>, <<<i>Beria</i>>>, <<<i>Yetzira</i>>>, and <<<i>Asiya</i>>>, because the world of <<<i>Adam Kadmon</i>>> is the <<<i>Keter</i>>> <<level>> of the lower four worlds. Similarly, the <<<i>partzuf</i>>> called Atik (literally, “Ancient”), the highest <<<i>partzuf</i>>> of an individual world, is the <<<i>Keter</i>>> of its respective world, and is defined as <i>Ein Sof</i> in relation to that world. The same applies to the <<<i>sefira</i>>> of <<<i>Keter</i>>> in each <<<i>partzuf</i>>>: It is defined as <i>Ein Sof</i> relative to that <<<i>partzuf</i>>>. The focus of most of the <i>Zohar</i> is on this relative <i>Ein Sof</i>.",199,

This equating of form creates a state called <i>devekut</i>, bonding, attachment, or merging one with the other.

Neshama,,,נְשָׁמָה,,,"The term <i>neshama</i> commonly refers to the soul, the divine aspect that exists within every being and sustains it.

Tzimtzum,constriction,,צִמְצוּם,,,"The constriction refers to a diminishing of the divine light. This constriction does not constitute a change in the divine light itself, as the Creator bestows His light constantly and fully.

In order for constriction to take place, the vessel is modified through the placement of a <<partition>> upon it so that it is prevented from receiving the light.

Although <i>partzuf</i> literally means “countenance” or “face,” it is actually composed of a <<head>>, a <<body>>, and legs, similar to the structure of a human body. A <i>partzuf</i> is formed as a result of a <<<i>fusion through collision</i>>>, where the <<returning light>> from the collision <<enclothed>> the supernal light, forming a new structure that reflects the qualities and amounts of the supernal light <<enclothed>> in the <<returning light>>. In each of the five worlds in reality – <<<i>Adam Kadmon</i>>>, <<<i>Atzilut</i>>>, <<<i>Beria</i>>>, <<<i>Yetzira</i>>>, and <<<i>Asiya</i>>> – there are five <i>partzufim</i>, corresponding to the five primary <<<i>sefirot</i>>>: <<<i>Keter</i>>>, <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>, <<<i>Bina</i>>>, <<<i>Tiferet</i>>>, and <<<i>Malkhut</i>>>.",151,

The collision between the supernal light and the partition causes the light to be rebuffed, and as a result, the <<returning light>> becomes a new vessel for the supernal light. There are partitions at every <<level>> of reality, and each partition has different degrees of <<<i>opacity (ovyut)</i>>> and <<<i>hardness (kashyut)</i>>>, giving rise to a variance in the structures of <<returning light>> that a given partition generates. This also underlies the variance found in the different <<levels>> of reality, such as the <<<i>partzufim</i>>>. In addition to the partitions that rebuff the light, there are partitions that serve as a terminating point of a particular <<level>> of existence (such as a <<<i>partzuf</i>>>), and the division between one <<level>> of existence and another. In general terms, it can be said that the different operations of these differences in the partitions are the causes of the differences between the various <<levels>> and stages of creation, as a result of the variance of <<opacity>> and <<hardness>> and the resulting varying heights of <<returning light>>.",249,
,Returning Light,,אוֹר חוֹזֵר,,,"The returning light is formed when the <<partition>> of a particular <<level>> of existence rebuffs the supernal light, returning it to its source in the manner of a light refracting off a mirror. This returning light is generated through the resistance of the receiving entity to receiving the supernal light. The returning light does not disappear but rather <<enclothes>> the supernal light, which is then manifest as a new vessel for the supernal light. All the <<levels>> and <<<i>partzufim</i>>> of creation are formed through <<enclothing>> supernal, or “direct light” in the receiving entity’s returning light.",95,
,Head,head,רֹאשׁ,,,"The head refers to the highest part of a <<level>>. For example, in each <<<i>partzuf</i>>>, the first three <<<i>sefirot</i>>> are considered the head of that <<<i>partzuf</i>>>.

,Body,body,גּוּף,,,"The term <i>guf</i>, body, essentially has three meanings in kabbalistic literature. The first is the vessel for the supernal light.

Second, “body” can refer to the central and important aspect that defines each <<level>>. The third meaning of “body” is in the context of the structure of a <<<i>partzuf</i>>>: the <<<i>sefirot</i>>> of <<<i>Ḥesed</i>>>, <<<i>Gevura</i>>>, and <<<i>Tiferet</i>>>, or sometimes <<<i>Ḥesed</i>>>, <<<i>Gevura</i>>>, <<<i>Tiferet</i>>>, <<<i>Netzaḥ</i>>>, <<<i>Hod</i>>>, and <<<i>Yesod</i>>>, contained in the <<<i>partzuf</i>>> are called the body of the <<<i>partzuf</i>>>, in contrast to the first three <<<i>sefirot</i>>> contained in the <<<i>partzuf</i>>> – <<<i>Keter</i>>>, <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>, and <<<i>Bina</i>>>  – which are considered the <<head>> of the <<<i>partzuf</i>>>.",136,
,Fusion through Collision,"fusions through collision, fusion through the collision, fusion, fusion through that collision",זִיוּוּג דְּהַכָּאָה,,,"Fusion through collision refers to the clash between the supernal light, which shines continuously, and a <<partition>>, which is the force of resistance of a created being, or <<<i>vessel</i>>>, to receiving the supernal light. When the supernal light is rebuffed by the created entity, the fusion through collision produces the <<returning light>>, which initiates the process through which a new vessel or entity is created. In this context, “fusion” denotes the merging of two entities, which leads to the formation of a new entity, while “collision” means opposition and rejection. These concepts express the two opposing forces that act upon the <<partition>>: <<<i>opacity (ovyut)</i>>>, which constitutes the will to receive the supernal light, and <<<i>hardness (kashyut)</i>>>, which is the force of resistance to the light and its repulsion. These two opposing forces act in parallel and cause the vessel to draw the supernal light in on one hand and rebuff it on the other, thus forming the <<returning light>>. It is this coupling interaction that gives birth to the new <<level>> and <<<i>partzuf</i>>>.",173,
Kelippot,Husks,kelippa,קְלִיפּוֹת,,,"<i>Kelippot</i> are <<levels>> of reality that do not contain any will to give, only the will to receive.

Shiur Koma,Dimension of Height,"shiurei koma, dimension of height",שִׁעוּרֵי קוֹמָה,,,"“Height” refers to a characteristic of the <<returning light>>, which reaches a certain height when it ascends as a result of the <<<i>fusion through collision</i>>> of the supernal light against the <<partition>>. What determines the height that the <<returning light>> reaches is the intensity of the repulsion of the supernal light by the <<partition>> of the created entity.<br>The measurement of these dimensions of height is expressed in different ways. One way is by marking the highest <<<i>sefira</i>>> of a given <<level>>. An example would be a <<level>> that is the height of <<<i>Bina</i>>>, or alternatively, a structure that is the height of the second <<level>> (another term for <<<i>Bina</i>>>).<br>Another way to express this idea is according to the amount of soul lights that have become contained within the particular <<level>>, which are called <<<i>nefesh</i>>>, <<<i>ruaḥ</i>>>, <<<i>neshama</i>>>, <<<i>ḥaya</i>>>, and <<<i>yeḥida</i>>>. For example, a “small height” is a <<level>> that contains only the light of <<<i>nefesh</i>>>. In comparison, a <<level>> that also contains the light of <<<i>ruaḥ</i>>> is considered “taller.”<br>A third way of expressing this concept is according to the nature of the light itself that is contained within the particular <<level>>.

Kashyut,Hardness,hardness,קַשְׁיוּת,,,"Hardness, or <i>kashyut</i>, is the capacity of the <<partition>> to rebuff the supernal light and return it to its source.

The measure of a <<partition>>’s hardness is commensurate with its measure of <<opacity (<i>oviyut</i>)>>, or the will it contains to receive the supernal light.

,Level,"levels, level, Levels",בחינה,,,"The word “level” has multiple meanings and usages in the writings of the Sulam, though these different meanings share a common core. The main idea is a reference to a layering structure in existence. At the “top” of the layers is the Source of all existence, the endless supernal light of the <<<i>Ein Sof</i>>>, the Endless One. This light shines “downward” through a series of layers, barriers or filters, ultimately manifesting in the form of the world we experience. It is these layers that give rise to the diversity and multiplicity we perceive in the created world around us, as the light “appears” differently after each layer it traverses.<br>There are many different kinds of layers in this system, and these form the different levels referred to in the text. Generally, there are five main structures of levels, which are the worlds of <<<i>Adam Kadmon</i>>>, <<<i>Atzilut</i>>>, <<<i>Beria</i>>>, <<<i>Yetzira</i>>> and <<<i>Asiya</i>>>. However, within each of these categories are also many levels or layers. Additionally, the <<<i>sefirot</i>>>, the main ingredients of all creation, are often described as “levels,” because they form the structures of the various layers of creation. Similarly, the more complex constructs of the <<<i>partzufim</i>>> are referred to as levels as well.<br>In addition to these layered levels, the Sulam describes how each aspect and level within existence contains all other aspects and levels. For example, each of the five main <<<i>sefirot</i>>> are described as levels, and also as individually containing all five of the <<<i>sefirot</i>>>. Each of the five <<<i>sefirot</i>>> comprising one <<<i>sefira</i>>> are said to be five levels within that individual <<<i>sefira</i>>>. This structure is somewhat similar to that of fractal geometry, in which macrostructures are mirrored by microstructures, and large structures are formed of smaller, parallel structures.<br>Thus, when the word “level” appears, it is important to be attentive to the discussion in the text, and to realize the word is used with some liberality, as opposed to one fixed type of usage. Fundamentally, it always refers to the layered structure of reality in some way, though there is variance in its application in each context.",346,
Light of giving,,,אוֹר חֲסָדִים,,,"The light of giving (<i>or ḥassadim</i>) is the type of <<<i>shefa</i> >> that is revealed as a result of the will or desire of a created being to give. This light originates in the second <<level>> of the <<<i>sefirot</i>>>, the <<level>> of <<<i>Bina</i>>>. This is in contrast to the other type of <<<i>shefa</i>>>, the light of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>, which is the light of the Creator that emanates in and from the first <<level>> of the <<<i>sefirot</i>>>, the <<level>> of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>. Although the light of giving is not the main lifeforce of the created beings, it contains an important quality related to the <<constriction>> (<i>tzimtzum</i>). Constriction involves the abstention of the vessel of the will to receive (the vessel of <<<i>Malkhut</i>>>) from receiving the light of the Creator. However, this <<constriction>> of the vessel applies only to the light of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>. The receiving vessel for the light of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>> is the will of the created being to receive. After the <<constriction>> this vessel is disqualified as a vessel for the divine light. However, <<constriction>> does not apply to the light of giving, whose vessel is the will of the created being to give. One result of this difference in the effects of the <<constriction>> is that the light of giving illuminates in places and ways where the light of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>> does not shine. Additionally, by <<enclothing>> the light of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>> in the light of giving, the light of giving helps the light of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>> illuminate <<levels>> from which it would otherwise be restricted.",,
Brains,,,מוֹחִין ,,,"The term “brains” (<i>moḥin</i>) generally refers to different <<levels>> of the light and vessels that are acquired by a particular <<level>> or <<<i>partzuf</i>>>.

The acquisition of these new “brains” can be thought of as similar to the human concept of mental development, in which a person’s mind expands and matures. Accordingly, the acquisition of brains is often called the <<maturity>> of the <<<i>partzuf</i>>> . The reason this expansion is called a “brain” is because these new lights either form a new <<head>> or are received in an existing <<head>> of a <<<i>partzuf</i>>>. ",,

Instead, it is a pseudo-<<<i>sefira</i>>> formed during a process called the “rectification of lines.” During this process, and as a result of the <<second constriction>>, two columns of light are formed, one associated with the right (the <<light of giving>>), and one associated with the left (the light of <<<i>Hokhma</i>>>, able to be received only by vessels formed of the will to receive). These two columns are described as in conflict, unable to “work together” and therefore unable to serve their function of merging and transmitting supernal light to lower <<levels>>. The rectification of this conflicted state comes through a middle line or column of light that ascends from below and mediates between the two sides.

Will to Receive,,will to receive,רָצוֹן לְקַבֵּל,,,"The will to receive is closely linked to the concept of <<opacity>>.

In kabbalistic terminology, this expresses the quality of the vessel, which is the will to receive. It is considered thick and dark because it is the antithesis of the eternal divine light, the essence of which is entirely giving. A greater will to receive is regarded as having greater opacity, while a vessel that contains a lesser will to receive is regarded as being more pure.

Leah,,,לֵאָה ,,,"It is known that <<<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>>> is constructed entirely from the <<brains>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>>. <<<i>Imma</i>>>, which is <<<i>Bina</i>>>, divides into the <<first three>> and the <<seven lower ones>>.

Likewise, <<<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>>> that is constructed from <<<i>Imma</i>>> is in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And I am a smooth man” (Genesis 27:11). For from the <<chest>> and above, the <<first three>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>> illuminate in it, that is, the covered <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>>, whereas from the <<chest>> and below, the <<seven lower ones>> of <<<i>Bina</i>>> illuminate in it, which are revealed <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>>. Since they are two virtually opposite expressions, the verse calls it “a smooth man,” smooth of <<hairs>>, as is known. 
Now, for the same reason the <<<i>Nukba</i>>> of <<<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>>> also divides into two. There is an upper <<<i>Nukba</i>>>, from the <<<i>Malkhut</i>>> of the <<first three>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>>, which is covered <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>>. This is called <<Leah>>.

The reverse is true of <<Rachel>>: Her entire holding is only in the <<<i>Yesod</i>>> of <<<i>Abba</i>>>, in the mystical meaning of “father (<i>Abba</i>) founded (<i>yasad</i>) the daughter.” Consequently, she cannot suckle from above the <<chest>> of <<<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>>>, since there the <<<i>Yesod</i>>> of <<<i>Abba</i>>> is hidden and concealed in the <<<i>Yesod</i>>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>> (<i>Talmud Eser Sefirot</i>, v. 14, Q & A 125).

The final letter mem,,,ם',,,"In the <<chest>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>> there remains a trace of the immaturity of the bottom <i>heh</i> in the <<eyes>>, even upon her <<maturity>>, after the <i>heh</i> has descended from there.

Accordingly, the <<first three>> are expressed only from the <<chest> and above, that is, her first six <<<i>sefirot</i>>>: <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>, <<<i>Bina</i>>>, <<<i>Daat</i>>>, <<<i>Ḥesed</i>>>, <<<i>Gevura</i>>>, and <<<i>Tiferet</i>>>, which are above the trace of the bottom <i>heh</i>. By contrast, the four <<<i>sefirot</i>>>: <<<i>Tiferet</i>>>, <<<i>Netzaḥ</i>>>, <<<i>Hod</i>>>, and <<<i>Yesod</i>>>, which are below her <<chest>, no longer contain the <<first three>>, since they are from the <<chest>> and below, where the trace of the bottom <i>heh</i> remains. With respect to this name, the upper six <<<i>sefirot</i>>> are called “circular <i>samekh</i>,” while the lower four, <<<i>Tiferet</i>>>, <<<i>Netzaḥ</i>>>, <<<i>Hod</i>>>, and <<<i>Yesod</i>>>, are called the final, or “closed <i>mem</i>.” All this applies to the upper <<<i>Imma</i>>>. From the <<<i>Malkhut</i>>> of the upper <<<i>Imma</i>>>, that is, the trace of the bottom <i>heh</i> in the place of the <<chest>>, <<<i>Yisrael</i> <i>Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>>> emerge. This <<<i>Malkhut</i>>> is called <i>dalet</i> (“four”), because it incorporates the four <<<i>sefirot</i>>>: <<<i>Tiferet</i>>>, <<<i>Netzaḥ</i>>>, <<<i>Hod</i>>>, and <<<i>Yesod</i>>>, which are the final <i>mem</i>. Thus, <<<i>Yisrael</i> <i>Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>>> is the fourth level of the upper <<<i>Imma</i>>>, such that the <i>samekh</i> and final <i>mem</i> are in the upper <<<i>Imma</i>>>, while <i>dalet</i> is in <<<i>Yisrael</i> <i>Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>>>. These letters: <i>Samekh</i>, final <i>mem</i>, and <i>dalet</i>, are also considered three <i>Tevunot</i>, since they are three separate levels.

The <i>dalet</i>, which <i></i>is an expression of <<<i>Yisrael</i> <i>Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>>>, is even lower than the <<<i>Malkhut</i>>> of the upper <<<i>Imma</i>>> itself, which is called a final <i>mem</i>.

For this reason the <<partition>> was given the name <<feminine waters>>, since from this point onwards it incorporates these two females in every <<fusion>> it performs with the supernal light (<i>Talmud Eser Sefirot</i>, v. 6, Q & A 15). 
The meaning of <<feminine waters>> is that it causes a <<fusion>>. It is always an expression of <<<i>Netzaḥ</i>>>, <<<i>Hod</i>>>, and <<<i>Yesod</i>>>, or <<<i>Ze’ir</i>>> and <<<i>Nukba</i>>>. For the female is instituted in the <<light>> of the <<back side>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>>, which is attached only to the <<light of giving>> and which rebuffs <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>. Accordingly, she does not turn her face towards the male to receive the illumination of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>, unless she is forced by some factor to do so. This factor is an expression of <<<i>Ze’ir</i>>> and <<<i>Nukba</i>>>, to which the <<<i>Bina</i>>> has a connection, to illuminate it with the illumination of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>, due to the relationship between <<<i>Bina</i>>> and the <<<i>Ze’ir</i>>> and <<<i>Nukba</i>>> of the <<direct light>>.

However, after the bottom <i>heh</i> has ascended in the <<eyes>>, and the <<opacity (<i>ovyut</i>)>> of the <<<i>Malkhut</i>>> has been incorporated in every <<<i>sefira</i>>> up to <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>> and has become the left <<line>> in all ten <<<i>sefirot</i>>> together (in contrast to the essence of the <<<i>sefirot</i>>> that became the right <<line>>, as is known), such that the middle <<line>> subsequently descends through the <<fusion>> of the supernal light, and balances between them, the result is that all ten <<<i>sefirot</i>>> have been connected and rectified in a single <<fusion>> by means of the middle <<line>>, in the mystical meaning of the private domain.

Rachel,,,רָחֵל ,,,"It is known that <<<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>>> is entirely constructed from the <<brains>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>>. <<<i>Imma</i>>>, which is <<<i>Bina</i>>>, divides into the <<first three>> and the <<seven lower ones>>. Her <<first three>> are <<<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>>>, which are <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>> that are covered and rebuffed from <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>, while her <<seven lower ones>> are <<<i>Yisrael</i> <i>Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>>> and revealed <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>> in the illumination of <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>>. Likewise, <<<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>>> that is constructed from <<<i>Imma</i>>> is in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And I am a smooth man” (Genesis 27:11). For from the <<chest>> and above, the <<first three>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>> illuminate in it, that is, the covered <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>>, whereas from the <<chest>> and below, the <<seven lower ones>> of <<<i>Bina</i>>> illuminate in it, which are revealed <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>>. Since they are two virtually opposite expressions, the verse calls it “a smooth man,” smooth of <<hairs>>, as is known. 
Now, for the same reason the <<<i>Nukba</i>>> of <<<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>>> also divides into two. There is an upper <<<i>Nukba</i>>>, from the <<<i>Malkhut</i>>> of the <<first three>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>>, which is covered <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>>. This is called <<Leah>>. She <<enclothes>> on its <<<i>Ḥesed</i>>>, <<<i>Gevura</i>>>, and <<<i>Tiferet</i>>> until the <<chest>>, which is in the place of her covered <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>>. It also has a second <<<i>Nukba</i>>>, from the <<<i>Malkhut</i>>> of the <<seven lower ones>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>>, which is revealed <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>>, called <<Rachel>>. She <<enclothes>> in the place of its <<chest>> and below, that is, in the place of its revealed <<<i>ḥassadim</i>>>. Accordingly, <<Leah>> receives only the <<back side>> of the <<<i>Yesod</i> (Foundation)>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>>, which ends at the place of the <<chest>>. For she rebuffs <<<i>Ḥokhma</i>>> like the <<first three>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>>, and cannot venture from the <<chest>> and below, where the <<<i>Yesod</i>>> of <<<i>Abba</i>>> serves openly. The reverse is true of <<Rachel>>: Her entire holding is only in the <<<i>Yesod</i>>> of <<<i>Abba</i>>>, in the mystical meaning of “father (<i>Abba</i>) founded (<i>yasad</i>) the daughter.” Consequently, she cannot suckle from above the <<chest>> of <<<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>>>, since there the <<<i>Yesod</i>>> of <<<i>Abba</i>>> is hidden and concealed in the <<<i>Yesod</i>>> of <<<i>Imma</i>>> (<i>Talmud Eser Sefirot</i>, v. 14, Q & A 125).

Traces,,traces,רְשִׁימוֹת ,,,"After the <<constriction (<i>tzimtzum</i>)>>, when the <<light>> of <<<i>Ein Sof</i>>> is removed from all four levels, as is known, its <<trace>> nevertheless remains in every level, a form of the <<light>> of <<<i>Ein Sof</i>>> it contained before the <<constriction>> (<i>Talmud Eser Sefirot</i>, v. 2, Q & A 72). 

What are these “traces,” outside of the context of <<constriction>>?
Know that this <<trace>> of themselves that the <<lights>> leave behind after their departure is the kernel and the root for engendering a second <<<i>partzuf</i>>> from it. For each effect emerges and is engendered by its cause in this manner, and thus all the <<lights>> in the worlds are drawn forth to the lower ones. They themselves are transferred from cause to the effect engendered by it, like the spark of a soul that is transferred from father to son, and which then remains permanently fixed in the son’s soul, as explained in <i>Or Penimi</i>, v. 4, section 82:3. This must be understood and kept in mind, for it is the key to understanding the factor that compels the effect to devolve from its cause, in the whole <<devolvement>> of the emergence of the <<<i>partzufin</i>>> and the worlds from one another, from beginning to end (<i>Talmud Eser Sefirot</i>, v. 4, Q & A 65).
