    HE BOOK OF
   </small>
   N
   <small>
    UMBERS
   </small>
   records the Israelites’ forty years’ journey from Sinai to the plains (or steppes) of Moab, their last stop before entering the Promised Land. The book begins with a census that numbers the eligible fighting men among the people who left Egypt—hence the English name “Numbers.” Yet it is the Hebrew name of the book,
   <i>
    B’midbar
   </i>
   (“in the wilderness [of]”), that aptly captures the challenges the book describes. Wilderness is a place—or time—without orienting landmarks or structure. Numbers charts the journey through a wilderness and attempts to create new structures in this intermediary space for future life in the land.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The book is itself a kind of wilderness, a seemingly chaotic combination of narratives, laws, and lists that can be roughly divided into three parts. Numbers’ narrative begins where
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_40.1-38">
    Exodus 40
   </a>
   left off. The first part describes orderly preparations and departure from Sinai, where the Israelites had camped for two years (
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#num_1.1-54">
    Numbers 1–10
   </a>
   ). The second part describes descent into chaos, with the Israelites’ (mis)-adventures during the journey. This section is marked by “murmurings” and rebellions, and their dire consequences (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_11.1-12.16">
    Numbers 11–25
   </a>
   ), including God’s decision to doom the generation of the Exodus to die in the wilderness. The third part describes the preparation of the new generation for life in the Promised Land (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num26">
    Numbers 26–37
   </a>
   ).

   The book’s major themes include: conflicts and decisions over leadership, worship and sanctuary, and land inheritance. Numbers
   <a id="page_788">
   </a>
   reflects competition over legitimate priesthood between the line of Aaron and other members from the tribe of Levi, to which Moses and Miriam also belong. The book grants the priesthood solely to men of the line of Aaron and only secondary responsibilities for the sanctuary to the rest of the men of Levi, known as Levites. Like Leviticus, Numbers is also concerned with ritual purity and thus it likewise prescribes steps to guard the sanctity of the sanctuary as well as the purity of all who approach it. Critical scholars typically question the book’s historical accuracy as a depiction of life in the wilderness; they conclude that Israel’s memory of this period was shaped over a long period of time, and that the laws and narratives in Numbers come primarily from priestly sources (see
   <a href="fm-06.xhtml#page_xxxvi">
    Women and Interpretation of the Torah
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Women appear more prominently in Numbers than in Leviticus—both as those to whom laws apply and as active figures in narratives; they play a significant role in nine out of thirty-six chapters.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Although most of the laws in Numbers pertain to women and men alike, some specifically concern women. These include the case of the wife suspected of adultery (
   <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num5-11-31">
    Numbers 5:11–31
   </a>
   ), which describes the ordeal she must undergo in such a situation; the laws about vows (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#n29-39">
    Numbers 30
   </a>
   ) that delineate who determines what vows a woman must honor; and laws of inheritance for when a man dies without a will and has daughters but no sons (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    Numbers 27
   </a>
   and
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
    36
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Whereas the case of the suspected wife and that of vows have women as their object of concern, the stories about inheritance present women as subjects: women who take action and initiate a new ruling that enables them as well as future women to inherit their ancestral land if their father has no sons. Here, five sisters named Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah (also known as Zelophehad’s daughters) argue their case before Israel’s leaders and the larger community, thereby effecting change. Perhaps most astonishing, their story also depicts a situation in which a Torah law emerges not from Sinai but from the women themselves (for details, see at
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    Numbers 27
   </a>
   and
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
    36
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Other stories include Miriam’s (and Aaron’s) challenge to Moses in
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
    Numbers 12
   </a>
   and the stories about dangerous women, especially foreign women (see the case of the Moabite/Midianite women in
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_25.1-9">
    Numbers 25
   </a>
   and
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_33.1-56">
    33
   </a>
   who are depicted as luring Israel away from God). Ultimately, little can be determined from Numbers about the actual lives of women in ancient Israel. Yet one can conclude from this book that women were perceived as a force to contend with, as well as a source for Torah.

   bridges the end of Exodus and the beginning of Numbers. Exodus concludes with a magisterial description of the Tabernacle and the priests—both resplendent in the colorful handiwork of Israelite women. Once God’s presence fills the Tabernacle and not even Moses can enter, a distinction between Divine and human becomes clear. Leviticus follows, with laws concerning how to negotiate this boundary between Divine and human. Numbers then returns to the topic with which Exodus ends. In Numbers the perspective is widened to include the formation in which Israel camps with the Tabernacle at its center. The Tabernacle complex, with its collapsible boundaries and open spaces, creates a sense of order in the unfamiliar chaos of the wilderness. The Tabernacle also helps orient the Israelites in the vast expanse of that wilderness, since they stay or go based on the ascent and descent of the cloud of God’s Presence. In this sense, God lives amidst the Israelites throughout their journey to the Promised Land.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   “Numbers,” the English name of the book, alludes to the social organization of the Israelites and the two censuses that frame the book (
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#num_1.1-54">
    Numbers 1
   </a>
   and
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num26">
    26
   </a>
   ); the Hebrew title,
   <i>
    B’midbar
   </i>
   (from the first distinctive word, meaning “in the wilderness [of]”), highlights the transitory setting of the narrative. The contrast between these two titles reflects a tension between order and chaos, culture and nature, obedience and rebellion that characterizes the book and drives its plot. This type of tension also suffuses the concept of holiness that operates in this book, in which one recognizes both the creative and the destructive power of God. While contact with God makes Israel holy, encountering God without preparation is potentially lethal.

   Although the scrupulous detail of this parashah and other parts of the book may not immediately grip the reader, the underlying idea is that the ordering of the community—and by extension, one’s life—creates the space for encounters with the Divine. The power of this book emerges from the image of the encampment’s concentric rectangles radiating inward to a core of supreme holiness. In this geometry of moving from the periphery to the center, the tribes encamp around the Levites, who encircle the high priestly family, who surround the Tabernacle’s curtained walls that enclose the court that buffers the Holy of Holies. This symmetry—constructed on the ground as well as in prose—is a collective act of ordering chaos
   <a id="page_790">
   </a>
   that emulates the creation of the world in
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">

    Parashat B’midbar

   illustrates how hierarchies in a given society are “spatialized,” meaning that its power structures are evident in the physical spaces of the society, such as city plans or religious architecture. In Numbers, for example, the arrangement of the camp favors the sons of Aaron as
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   (priests), whereas the marching order gives prominence to the sons of Judah. Military language and concepts infuse the description of the camp’s arrangement. It is not surprising, therefore, that women do not appear in this parashah; counting conceals the female presence in the community. (For a somewhat different perspective on women’s apparent absence, see

   opens by setting the date of the census:
   <i>
    Rosh Chodesh Iyar,
   </i>
   the start of the second month of the second year since Israel departed from Egypt. Although the Israelites are more than a year deep in their journey, this date marks something of a new beginning since they are now in possession of laws as well as the Tabernacle. A central theme of the book of Numbers is transition; the census relates to this theme by depicting the transition of the tribes into a national body.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   How are we to understand the litany of names that fill this parashah? The ordering of the camp is akin to the necessary preparations that precede any expedition or long trip, as departure requires taking stock of what one brings along. The dominant motivation of this census is to organize Israel into battalions in order to begin the march toward Canaan. As the Torah reminds us, other nations inhabit the Promised Land; so before Israel claims the destination as home, it will have to reconstitute itself as a nation of warriors.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   But the census also represents a point reached in every community when the group takes stock of who stands in its ranks. This, then, is a moment of Israel’s self-assessment, where the generation previously numbered only as slaves in Egypt perceives itself as a unified nation. However, in an important sense, the opening of Numbers is utopian; as the rest of the book demonstrates, the generation that once knew slavery in Egypt proves incapable of remaking itself into a nation of warriors and reaching the Promised Land. Their fate instead will be to perish in the wilderness and find consolation in the fact that their children will achieve what they could not.

   A census is a practical tool but also a mode of enforcing power. Who does the recording and who is recorded are not incidental issues; rather, the answers provide a form of centralizing authority and of creating a definitive hierarchy. The
   <i>
    Tanach
   </i>
   records several censuses and (in its characteristic way) includes examples that express ambivalence about this practice. While there is something rousing about the emergence of organized troops from the newly liberated and still somewhat beleaguered people of Israel, other occasions of census taking unleash chaos on the Israelites (II Samuel 24:1–10; I Chronicles 21:1–8; 27:23–24). There is thematic tension between the idea that Israel should be numberless (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g15-5">
    Genesis 15:5
   </a>
   ; I Kings 3:8) and the occasions of census taking.

   </i>
   Heb.
   <i>
    beit avot.
   </i>
   The tribes are made up of clans comprised of families, and the family unit in turn includes a cluster of households. The “ancestral house” (extended family) is the core institution of the agricultural and tribal system of ancient Israel. This unit claims a specific tract of land as well as its yield and workers. The
   <i>
    beit avot
   </i>
   (also called
   <i>
    beit av,
   </i>
   as when Rachel and Leah speak in
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#g31-14">
    Genesis 31:14
   </a>
   ) is an extended-family structure made up of all the descendants of a living ancestor, whereas the larger clan and tribal units rally around the memory of a more distant patriarchal figure. When a female member of the
   <i>
    beit avot
   </i>
   marries, she generally departs from her
   <i>
    beit avot
   </i>
   and joins that of her husband. At no level in this parashah are women recorded, but the very notion of a family or a household as a basis of society demands recognition of female power and agency.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The hierarchy at work becomes apparent as only men are counted as Israelites at this juncture, and as priests and Levites secure exemptions. The census regroups Israel along military lines, yet we note that all of the potential fighting men of Israel comprise less than half of the community, not the whole.

   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e38-8">
    Exodus 38:8
   </a>
   ; I Samuel 2:22). In Isaiah 40:2 the same term, referring to conscript service, is ascribed to Jerusalem personified as a woman. When the prophet Deborah commands the Israelites to go to war, she appoints a man, Barak, to lead the troops. (Upon Barak’s insistence, however, Deborah accompanies him in battle; see Judges 4:1–10.)

   At certain junctures in the wilderness, it becomes apparent that Israel comprises twelve tribes. Each tribe adheres to an internal order while participating in the larger community. Maintaining tribal boundaries with respect to land inheritance will later prompt one group to challenge the unqualified grant of land to the daughters of Zelophehad: Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah. See at 36:1–13.

   Following the census, those listed in the ranks gather under the banner or “standard” of their tribes and stand proud as the army of Israel. The army that here appears well poised for battle will not prove psychologically ready, so invasion is postponed for a generation (see
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#d2-14">

   [The Hebrew word that is uniquely translated here as “registered” is a form of the verbal root

   This summation of the command closes this section, which began, “God spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai” (
   <a href="#num_1.1-54">
    1:1
   </a>
   ). Divine speech frames this section and legitimizes the subsequent census by marking it as a reflection of divine will. This emphasis is important in light of God’s reported opposition elsewhere to taking a census (see, for example, II Samuel 24:1–10, where God punishes Israel for King David’s decision to take a census).

   THE CENSUS (1:20–46)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In military formation, the twelve tribes of Israel are Reuben, Simon, Gad, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, Dan, Asher, and Naphtali. (The tribe of Levi is counted separately; see below at
   <a href="#N1-50">
    1:47–54
   </a>
   .) Rachel’s son Joseph is represented in terms of his and Asenath’s two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. According to this parashah, the men of Israel over twenty years of age number 603,550; but the sum is more impressive when one thinks of more than double the number of women and children.
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.37-42">
    Exodus 12:37
   </a>
   counts the number of men who leave Egypt as roughly six hundred thousand. Jacob Milgrom suggests that the tribal numbers may symbolize astronomical calculations intended to present Israel as God’s battalions (
   <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#e7-7">
    Exodus 7:4
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.41">
    12:41

  <div class="head2" id="num_vv-47.54">
   THE LEVITES (1:47–54)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The book of Numbers divides the men of the tribe of Levi into subordinate Levites and superior priests (the latter being of direct descent from Aaron). The Levites were not listed among the other tribes previously counted since they are exempt from military service. The Levites will not inherit territory in the land, claiming their patrimony instead in the sphere of Tabernacle service (see
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#num_3.1-4.20">
    Numbers 3–4
   </a>
   and
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_8.1-9.14">
    8
   </a>
   ). Although Levites will not face the dangers of war, they must contend with the dangers of the holy, for if they do not maintain optimal holiness, they risk being destroyed by proximity to the Divine.

    </b>
   </i>
   Levites set up the portable shrine, maintain its various components, dismantle it when it is time for Israel to journey forward, and carry it to the next encampment. After they set up the Tabernacle at a certain place, the Levites camp around it, in order to buffer divine power.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   This severe prohibition aims to maintain boundaries. The Levites buffer and protect the Tabernacle from outside encroachment. The severe penalty of death is meant less as an assurance of inevitable violence and more as a means of maintaining the definitive boundaries between the holy and the profane, as well as between Levites and Israelites. An analogue is at work between the Israelite body and the Tabernacle. As the body undergoes purification rituals when interior fluids seep out, so the priests sanctify the Tabernacle interiors. As the body must be protected from foreign organisms, so the Levites shield the Tabernacle margins.

   This military term can be translated as “banner.” We know that in the ancient Jewish colony at Elephantine, Egypt,
   <i>
    degel

   designated a military unit. So the term means not only a standard but also the force that marches beneath the standard. (In modern Hebrew it refers to a flag.) The twelve tribes will be organized under four such standards or banners.

   he sacred structure houses a Tent of Meeting or Tabernacle (the terms appear to be used interchangeably in this parashah) at its center. Priests sacrifice in the court and offer incense inside as a way of communicating with God. Four groups of Levites surround the Tent, one group on each side, with Moses and Aaron’s family in the most privileged position (see below). The tribes of Israel appear around the Levites’ camp in four groups, each composed of three tribes united under a single standard or division. When Israel marches through the wilderness, the eastern (Judah) and southern (Reuben) divisions lead, followed by the Levites transporting the Tabernacle and backed up by the western (Ephraim) and northern (Dan) divisions.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   It is most likely that such a configuration never actually existed in the historical past. Instead, the Tabernacle is the mythic structure behind Israelite—and later, Jewish—sacred space. According to the book of Kings, it is this structure—with concentric spheres of increasing holiness—that King Solomon employs when building the Temple in Jerusalem. The synagogue, which after the Temple’s destruction (70
   <small>
    C.E.
   </small>
   ) would stand at the center of Jewish life, realizes this myth by placing the Ark that holds the Torah in a prominent place in the sanctuary. The biblical Ark of the Torah signifies the Ark of the Covenant, and the shared contents bind contemporary Jews to their ancient ancestors. (For more on the Tabernacle, see the

   The God who spoke to the Israelites from atop Mount Sinai now dwells in their midst and travels with them. The distance between the divine dwelling and the rest of Israel’s camp is determined and mediated by the Levites and priests.

   </i>
   When the camp marches forward, the tribes who hold the position of the rising sun (the east) move first. The configuration of the camp has both ritual and military implications. During periods of encampment, the band of tribes surrounding the Tabernacle serves as a line of defense protecting the sanctuary; and during the march, the infantry tribes are reinforced by God’s presence hovering over the sacred items of the Tent.

The tribes descended from Rachel are stationed farthest from the Tabernacle entrance, perhaps referencing Rachel’s untimely death outside the entrance of the town of Ephrath (

   he tribe of the Levites, to which both Moses and Aaron belong, was barely mentioned in Leviticus, which focuses on the priests. In Numbers, however, the Levites receive privileges that set them apart from other tribes. This step enlarges the structure of those who officiate at the Tabernacle. This broader circle of official personnel does not seem to include women. On women and Israel’s priesthood, see

   The tribe of Levi is favored in this parashah. For example, the priests and Levites who camp around the Tabernacle are also elected to maintain it. In addition, the Levites stand in for Israel’s first-born sons, who belong to God as an eternal ransom for the first-born sons who were not killed during the tenth plague on Egypt (see
   <a href="#num_3-13">
    vv. 12–13
   </a>
   ). Such features suggest that it was priests who edited or authored the first part of the book of Numbers.

   In this section, the text’s composers—presumably Aaron’s descendants—give first priority to the authority of the priests. However, they are not apologists. Their honored ancestor, Aaron, is recorded later in Numbers as transgressing (
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#n20-1">
    20:1–13
   </a>
   ) and dies far from the Promised Land (

   The priestly writers are invested in a kind of deterministic genealogy. In other words, they see social position as arising from one’s station at birth. Such a hereditary principle supports the idea of priestly distinction. Although they are brothers, only Aaron, not Moses, transmits the priesthood. Aaron’s sons become the religious elite.

   As a standard of hygiene and often as a form of luxury, people in the ancient Near East—including women—used to anoint themselves and their children with oil (I Samuel 14:2; Ezekiel 16:9; Ruth 3:3). But here the Hebrew uses a special verb that, when applied to persons, refers to pouring oil on the head in order to signal the assumption of an office, usually the kingship or the priesthood. That verbal root (
   <i>
    m-sh-ch
   </i>
   ) also forms the noun
   <i>
    mashiach,
   </i>
   which later becomes the title “Messiah.” (See also at

   These two sons of Aaron and Elisheba (
   <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#e6-20">
    Exodus 6:23
   </a>
   ) were instantly annihilated when they encroached upon the Holy with the wrong sort of offering (see at
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.1-7">
    Leviticus 10:1–2

   Just as the Levites have a distinct position within Israel, so the

   The priestly hierarchy is realized in the system of access to the various interiors of the Tent of Meeting. As the priests perform their sacred duties inside it, the Levites stand watch around the perimeter; all other members of Israel may approach the Divine at the threshold at specified times when they are in the correct state of purity. The priests supervise Israel’s access to the Tent of Meeting.

   This verse defines who exactly counts as first-born for the purpose of this legislation. The definition refers specifically to a woman’s first-born (not a man’s first-born). By speaking of the womb rather than the woman, the fertile womb is disassociated from the mother. The image is of a womb magically yielding offspring in the absence of female reproductive agency.

    SRAELITES PREPARE
   </small>
   to resume their journey, Moses leads the community in organizational activities: census-taking and the placement of tribal units in preparation for the march. The principles of organization are value-laden; they count only able-bodied men of fighting age in the initial census, and they divide the Levites into units with unequal privileges concerning the holy sanctuary. Though all of the members of the community are traveling to the same place, they do so in a structured fashion in which the boundaries of tribal units are carefully maintained, and in which some groups have more responsibility—and more access to the divine sphere—than others. The overarching tone of the parashah is subsequently patriarchal and hierarchical.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Patriarchy as a cultural system is based on power differentials; able-bodied men are defined as the powerful and active members of the community. (See, for example, bell hooks,
   <i>
    Feminist Theory from Margin to Center,
   </i>
   1984.) This is evident in the notable absence of women and other marginal figures from this parashah. What is the place allotted in the Israelite encampment for women, children, or the infirm? Even when the men of Levi are assigned to be Tabernacle functionaries, God states that they are taken for this role as redemption for the Israelite first-born males (
   <a href="#num_3-13">
    3:12
   </a>
   ). Again, it is men who are the focus of the narrative, and all important tasks in this parashah are done by men.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   It is possible, however, to glean from this text a lesson about a handful of important women: Jacob’s wives and the wives’ handmaids. The structure of the Israelite encampment is not random; rather, it groups together certain tribes while separating others. Leah’s descendants—Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun—have pride of place within the Israelite encampment, on the east side closest to the entrance to the Tabernacle. Her other descendants—Reuben, Simeon, and Gad—are located on the south side of the Tabernacle. Their placement can be explained by
   <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#ge_49.1-27">
    Genesis 49
   </a>
   : all three of these tribal ancestors committed acts that drew harsh criticism from Jacob, and subsequently they are held in lower esteem than their full brothers. The children of the handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah are represented on the northern side of the encampment, and Rachel’s offspring are located on the western side, farthest from the Tabernacle entrance. Hence the descendants of Jacob’s most beloved wife are in a position of less honor than the children of the long-suffering Leah. Even while ignoring the roles of women in defining the community, this parashah still makes a strong statement about the matriarchs of Israel. (See further Mary Douglas,
   <i>
    In the Wilderness,

   1993, pp. 172–95.)

Furthermore, according to this midrash, God assigned three mentors to sustain Israel in the wilderness: Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. Due to the merits of Moses, the people ate manna; due to the merits of Aaron, God encircled Israel with clouds of glory; and due to the merits of Miriam, a miraculous well accompanied them. The passage continues, “How was the well constructed? It was rock-shaped like a kind of beehive, and wherever they journeyed it rolled along and came with them.” When the Israelites stopped and the portable Tabernacle was erected, the well would establish itself in the Tent of Meeting. “Then the leaders of the tribes would come and stand upon it and say, ‘Spring up, O well!’ (
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#N21-16">

   <i>
    B’midbar Rabbah

   2.26 reports that when one of those men was incapacitated, one of the others took on the role of chief priest in his stead. This text goes on to discuss a woman named Kimhith who lived many centuries later: she had seven sons and each of them served in the office of chief priest. On one occasion, two sons served as chief priest on the same day. The Rabbis paid her a visit and asked her, “What good deeds have you performed to merit such an honor?” She responded, “So help me Heaven! In all my life the rafters of my house have never looked upon the hair of my head.” Rabbinic society, like many surrounding cultures, believed that married women should cover their heads when they went out in public. Kimhith’s modesty was such that she did not uncover her hair, even in the privacy of her own home. Punning on her name, the Rabbis observed, “All flours (

   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">

   ; the fruit of the womb, [God’s] reward.” The midrash explains that “provision of

   There is also danger in taking a census. This parashah is all about enumerating people, as the English name of the book, “Numbers,” suggests. However, the Talmud asserts that “it is forbidden to count [the nation of] Israel even for the sake of a commandment…[because] whoever counts Israel transgresses a prohibition, as it is written, ‘The number of the children of Israel shall be like the sands of the sea, not to be measured’ (Hosea 2:1)” (BT
   <i>
    Yoma
   </i>
   22b). Rashi explains that we must count something each person gives (like the half-shekel) rather than count actual people, because then “there will not be a plague among them, for the evil eye can affect that which is counted—and a plague may come upon them as we found in the days of David” (Rashi on
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_30.1-10">
    Exodus 30:1
   </a>
   ). Is Rashi merely superstitious, or is he suggesting that it is dangerous to trivialize a person’s essence? His comment teaches us that we must value each human as one who is made
   <i>

   </i>
   in God’s image (
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#g1-26">
    Genesis 1:27
   </a>
   ). A number can measure whether an army has enough people, but it can never measure the worth of the individual people in that army.

   Today, American society is obsessed with numbers, censuses, and demographic studies. Now when we calculate our Temple membership, for instance, we include everybody: the women and the men, the young and the old, the “typical” and the challenged. We can look at sum totals, categories, and sub-categories of these studies; and while they provide valuable information, they still may not show us who or what really counts. Can we say that all people matter when our
   <a id="page_811">

   Jewish institutions are not accessible to every individual? Taking the synagogue as an example, do we value each person when a member in a wheelchair cannot come up to the Ark to take the Torah? Do we include everyone in worship services when we do not offer large-print prayer books or when we do not provide hearing aids to those who need them? Do we validate those with different learning styles and abilities when we hire inexperienced educators for our Religious School classes? If we compare our raw data with the facts within the synagogue walls, who really matters—the ones who are counted, or the ones for whom we take extra measures? While numbers may be essential, they do not represent the sum total of what is truly important. But what does?

  <div class="tab-enin">
   In
   <i>
    B’midbar,
   </i>
   one could argue that the number of troops is what really counts, since they are the ones included in the census. But when we read between the lines, when we ask who is not included, we can see how the untold stories of the unmentioned people matter too. For instance, what about the woman who might have wished to fight? Or how about the 19-year-old man, just months short of his 20th birthday, eager to serve God and his people? And how about the 23-year-old male Israelite who can count the right number of years but not the right number of limbs since one of his was lost in a childhood accident? And the pregnant soldier’s wife who calculates the number of weeks until her baby arrives, knowing that the baby’s father’s days may be numbered? There may be contextually legitimate reasons why these people are omitted from the census, and, ultimately, from the Torah text, but their exclusion means we miss the opportunity to see what they can offer the community.

   We all hear stories about those who lose one thing and gain something even greater through their loss. There is an urban legend about violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman, who taught that lesson by happenstance when he played a concerto at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City with a broken string. One might think it impossible to play with just three strings a concerto written for violin, but Perlman did it and did so with great fervor. Upon completing his dazzling performance, he (so the story goes) said humbly to the audience, “You know, sometimes it is the artist’s task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.” Perhaps this is true for all of us, not only artists. Losses can lead to inner strengths and life changes that we did not dream were possible. We are more than the sum total of our parts.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Israelites may have needed parameters for whom to include and whom to exclude from the census described in
   <i>
    B’midbar,
   </i>
   but we must remember why even those not tallied do, in fact, matter. Today we may count every individual in our community, but may still discount how much they have to offer. The missing members in this parashah can teach us to reconsider what it means to count. As the numerous stories in the Bible and in our lives remind us, even those not included are important, and all those we now seek to include genuinely are individuals with much to gain from and offer to our communities.
