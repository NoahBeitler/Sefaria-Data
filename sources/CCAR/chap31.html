   (“say”) continues the holiness-centered legislation of the previous parashah. It, too, is part of the Holiness Code—the collection of laws in
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
    Leviticus 17–26
   </a>
   , which modern critical scholars refer to as “H” and attribute to a specific group of reform-minded priests.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This parashah contains instructions concerning the sanctity of the priests and the sacrificial offerings, the weekly Sabbath and annual festivals, and the maintenance of the Tabernacle lamp and showbread. The parashah ends with a story about the crime and punishment of a blasphemer. It also includes brief legal conclusions about damages governed by the retaliation principle (Latin:
   <i>
    lex talionis;
   </i>
   sometimes referred to via the biblical expression “eye for an eye”). In discussing the priests, the writers distinguish between three types: the chief priest, other priests who may officiate, and those who may receive some of the benefits but cannot carry out public roles because of disqualifying circumstances.

   Several issues related to women arise in
   <i>
    parashat Emor.
   </i>
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
    Leviticus 21
   </a>
   provides strict guidelines for priests regarding various areas of family life, including which women in their family they can bury, which women they can marry, and how they must respond to a daughter’s sexual misbehavior.
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
    Leviticus 22
   </a>
   , discussing who may partake of the priest’s portion of the sacred donations, addresses the question of when a priest’s daughter is considered a part of his household and would thus be entitled to part of her father’s share. Additionally,
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_24.10-23">
    24:10-14
   </a>
   mentions Shelomith, daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan, one of the few named individuals in all of Leviticus, and the only named woman. Shelomith’s unnamed son, whose father is an unnamed Egyptian, commits an act of blasphemy, and the Israelite judicial system must determine how to respond to this crime. This episode raises the question of who in the community must comply with the divine commandments.

   REGULATIONS FOR PRIESTS’ FAMILIES (21:1–9)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Because the priests are charged with the performance of sacred rites, they must observe strict codes of purity, lest any sort of impurity profane the sanctuary or its sacred objects and thus drive out God’s Presence. This section addresses two primary issues regarding priests: defilement by corpses and the purity of their wives and daughters. In both instances there are obvious ramifications concerning women.

    </b>
   </i>
   While lay people may come into contact with corpses, priests must restrict such contact, since dead bodies are considered highly defiling. Although priests are generally prohibited from such exposure, a concession allows them to defile themselves for their closest blood relatives—but not for kinfolk related by marriage. The list of exemptions does not mention the wife. This raises the question: is a priest allowed to participate in the burial of his own wife? Although the topic is not addressed explicitly, this passage seems to preclude a priest from touching his dead wife and attending her burial. Presumably, he can supervise the burial from a certain distance. (See further at
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">

   </a>
   , which prohibit a man from sexual relations with his aunt because she is his parent’s “flesh.” —

   Heb.
   <i>
    b’tulah
   </i>
   is better understood here in a more general sense to refer to a stage in a woman’s life characterized by youth and nubility. A more accurate translation might be “adolescent,” since there are contexts in which a
   <i>
    b’tulah
   </i>
   evidently is not a virgin (Esther 2:17–19). Moreover, sometimes the term
   <i>
    b’tulah
   </i>
   is qualified by the clause “whom no man had yet known [sexually]” or its variant, “who had not [sexually] known a man” (as in Judges 11:37–39; 21:12;
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24:16
   </a>
   ), further indicating that
   <i>
    b’tulah
   </i>
   is not always synonymous with what we mean by “virgin.” An adolescent girl who was not yet married in ancient Israel would have been presumed to be a virgin, since girls were married very young and bridal virginity was the expected norm. In certain cases (including
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    vv. 13–14
   </a>
   , below), the context dictates that the translation “virgin” is most appropriate. In the present verse, however, as in the great majority of cases, such a specific translation would be inappropriate.

    </b>
   </i>
   A sister is considered “close” until she marries and leaves the household to live with her husband’s family. Once she is living with her husband’s family, the concession that permits the priest to attend a sister’s burial no longer applies in her case because the wording presumes that her husband’s family will attend to her. However, if his sister is still living within the priest’s household when she dies, the priest is responsible for attending to her burial.

    </b>
   </i>
   Literally, “as a husband among his kin.” This obscure wording appears to prohibit a priest from attending to the burial of his wife or coming close to her place of burial, since she is kin by marriage, not by blood. In ancient Israel a husband normally would have been responsible for the burial of his wife; since priests were prohibited from burying anyone other than blood kin (
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
    v. 1
   </a>
   ), presumably they were expected to arrange for others—members of the household or designated agents—to bury her. (At a later period, the Rabbis, reading
   <i>
    sh’eiro
   </i>
   in v. 2 as “his wife,” found a way to interpret the law so as to include the priest’s wife among those members of the family that he could personally bury.)

   The law does not prohibit priests from all displays of mourning. However, this verse outlaws these particular mourning rites, perhaps because they were associated with Canaanite funerary practices (see at
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu_12.1-16.17">
    Deuteronomy 14:1–2

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   What does it mean to profane the name of God? In the Holiness Code (see the
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml">
    parashah introduction
   </a>
   ), God’s name stands for God’s reality and therefore has the power to sanctify the people and the priests, bringing the lay population closer to their aspired level of holiness. The concern with profaning God’s name runs throughout the parashah (for example,
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.6">
    21:6
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_22.32">
    22:32
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_24.10-23">
    24:10–16
   </a>
   ). Profaning the divine name takes away its power to sanctify and thus nullifies whatever holiness has been achieved through the observance of God’s laws and regulations. Why does the concern about desecration focus on God’s name, rather than on God? The Holiness Code carefully avoids anthropomorphic images of God (compare
   <a href="56_chapter_53.xhtml#deu_32.1-43">
    Deuteronomy 32
   </a>
   ). The priests responsible for this material hold that God cannot possibly be contaminated, desecrated, or directly affected in a way that diminishes God’s own holiness. Therefore it speaks in terms of the desecration of God’s name—rather than God’s self.

   </i>
   The restrictions concerning whom priests may marry reflect a concern with protecting both the priests’ lineage and their reputation. On the one hand, the priesthood passes down from father to son, and thus the marriage restrictions can assure priests that their sons are of their own line. On the other hand, priests—who are charged with the care and maintenance of the sanctuary—are most likely expected to behave in a way appropriate to their esteemed station. Since the members of a priest’s family partake of his portion of the holy sacrifices and live in his household, the Holiness Code (see the
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml">
    parashah introduction
   </a>
   ) likewise expects them to conduct themselves with a certain level of propriety; thus, only women of good repute are considered appropriate wives. For the same reason, a priest’s daughter comes under close scrutiny, and her father should take action if her behavior is inappropriate for one of her station.

      a woman defiled by harlotry.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   This phrase, literally “a harlot woman and one defiled,” is a hendiadys (the use of two words to express a single concept). Here the term “defiled” is probably intended in a figurative rather than a literal sense, and thus we should understand it as “degraded by harlotry.” According to the Holiness Code (see the
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml">
    parashah introduction
   </a>
   ), a man who makes his daughter into a prostitute “defiles” (that is, degrades) her; moreover, his action results in the land’s being filled with depravity—since other fathers, following his example, will prostitute their daughters (
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.29">
    19:29
   </a>
   ). The reason for the disqualification of a harlot as an appropriate wife for a priest is two-fold. First, pragmatically speaking, the priest would never be sure that the harlot’s offspring would be his own. Second, given that the Holiness Code considers prostitution to be a form of depravity, having a harlot for a wife would be highly inappropriate. The very existence of this prohibition raises the possibility that the Holiness Code does not object to lay members of the community marrying prostitutes.

    </b>
   </i>
   There are only a few references to men divorcing their wives in biblical texts.
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_22.13-29">
    Deuteronomy 22:13–14
   </a>
   presents the case of a man, apparently seeking to divorce his wife after taking an aversion to her, who makes up charges of sexual misconduct against her (claiming that she was not a virgin when they married). In
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_23.10-24.9">
    Deuteronomy 24:1
   </a>
   , a man divorces his wife because he finds in her
   <i>
    ervat davar,
   </i>
   literally “the nakedness of the thing,” a term whose meaning is unclear, but could refer to some type of behavioral impropriety, possibly sexual in nature. (
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_23.10-24.9">
    Deuteronomy 23:15
   </a>
   , the only other place where this expression appears, seems to support this interpretation.) In Hosea 2:4–7, God’s metaphoric wife Israel is threatened with divorce because of her infidelities. Each of these cases involves either improper behavior or false charges of improper behavior on the part of the wife, mainly of a sexual nature. This pattern or assumption might explain why the present verse prohibits a priest from marrying a divorcée. Marriage to a woman possibly prone to sexual promiscuity is problematic for priests, who must be sure that their progeny is their own, and whose family must maintain a certain level of propriety. Note that widows, who generally were above such suspicions, are acceptable marital candidates for priests, except for the chief priest (see
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">

   There are two possible interpretations of the verbal root
   <i>
    z-n-h
   </i>
   (“harlotry”) in this passage. The term could refer to the actual practice of prostitution, as it does in
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
    Genesis 38:15
   </a>
   and
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
    Leviticus 19:29
   </a>
   ; or it could be used in a metaphoric sense to denote illicit sexual activity by a woman (premarital sex or adultery), as it does in
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
    Genesis 38:24
   </a>
   and
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_22.13-29">
    Deuteronomy 22:21
   </a>
   . Both interpretations would work equally well in this context. A priest’s daughter, like his wife, is expected to maintain a high level of propriety, since her behavior reflects upon her father. As noted above (
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
    v. 7
   </a>
   ), although the Holiness Code does not prohibit prostitution outright, it considers the practice to be degrading and thus inappropriate for the daughter of a priest. Either prostitution or promiscuity would have brought shame and disgrace to the woman’s family.

   The unity of the household means that a daughter’s action is not an independent action but an extension of the father. Impropriety on her part profanes the father and interferes with his ability to carry out his priestly duties.

   There are only three other cases in the Bible in which we read of such a punishment, and two of them involve sexual offenses. In
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
    Genesis 38:24
   </a>
   , Judah demands that his daughter-in-law, Tamar, be put to death by fire for committing adultery while awaiting levirate marriage, although in the end she avoids punishment.
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.9-21">
    Leviticus 20:14
   </a>
   states that if a man marries both a woman and her mother, all three are to be put to the fire. In Joshua 7:25, the Israelites stone and burn Achan (a certain member of the tribe of Judah) and his household for his violating the sacred ban (
   <i>
    cherem
   </i>
   ), a prohibition against taking enemy property that was dedicated to God. Since fire is often regarded as a purifying substance, it may have been reserved for offenses where a form of purgation was deemed necessary due to the level of pollution incurred by the offender.

   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_22.13-29">

   These verses give special attention to the question of when a priest’s daughter may partake of the sacred offerings. A priest’s daughter is entitled to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations so long as she is part of his household. If she marries a member of the priesthood, her entitlement then derives from her husband. If she marries outside the priesthood, she becomes a part of the lay community and thus loses her entitlement to partake of the sacred donations. This passage indirectly sheds light on the status of daughters and is consistent with intimations elsewhere (see
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
    v. 9
   </a>

   </i>
   It is not clear under what conditions a widow in ancient Israel would inherit her husband’s estate. A widow or divorcée without children might well have no claim to that estate, in which case she would likely have to go back to her father’s household, since she would have no other means of support (see the story of Tamar in
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
    Genesis 38
   </a>
   ). Here, when a priest’s daughter who has married a lay person re-enters her father’s household under such circumstances, she regains her entitlement to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Some widows or divorcées may have had independent means of support. According to biblical law, when a householder dies without making a will, his sons inherit his estate; if he has no sons, his daughters inherit—as in the case of the daughters of Zelophehad,
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    Numbers 27:7–9
   </a>
   . If be has no children, the estate stays within his family. Furthermore, a householder apparently could either will his property to his wife or gift it to his daughter, as with Achsah in Joshua 15:16–19.

   </a>
   presents a calendar of sacred occasions—dates set apart and designated as belonging to God. This calendar includes the weekly Sabbath, as well as the annual festivals, beginning in the spring with the paschal offering and ending in the fall with Sukkot and Sh’mini Atzeret. The parallel calendar in
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_28.1-30.1a">
    Numbers 28–29
   </a>
   focuses on the required sacrificial offerings for each sacred occasion, information provided in some of the instructions here. The present passage focuses mainly on explicating the times of the sacred occasions and prohibiting work on certain days. For a discussion of women’s roles in these sacred times, see
   <a href="fm-07.xhtml#page_xli">

   largely addressed the priests and dealt with priestly matters. But the regulations for sacred times concern the community at large and thus are addressed to the entire people. Women are not specifically mentioned in these laws, yet there is no reason to presume that they are excluded from this legislation.

   The sequence in this section is as follows: the Sabbath (v. 3); the Passover Offering and the Feast of Unleavened Bread (vv. 5–8); the First Barley Offering (vv. 9–14); the First Wheat Offering (Shavuot) (vv. 15–22); the Festival of Alarm Blasts (Rosh HaShanah) (vv. 23–25); the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) (vv. 26–32); the Festival of Booths (Sukkot) (vv. 33–35); the Solemn Gathering (Sh’mini Atzeret) (v. 36); conclusion (vv. 37–38); and further laws for the Festival of Booths (vv. 39–43).

   The Sabbath is described as a day without work. In contrast to
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_28.1-30.1a">
    Numbers 28:9–10
   </a>
   , there is no reference to sacrifices here. The passage does not specify what counts as “work,” although other passages do supply some details (see
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.23-6.1">
    Exodus 3
   </a>
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.23-6.1">
    5:1–3
   </a>
   and
   <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_15.1-41">
    Numbers 15:32–36
   </a>
   ). On the meaning of the Sabbath, see
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_30.11-31.18">
    Exodus 31:12–17

   This clause, which is also used in

   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_23.1-44">
    vv. 3 and 28
   </a>
   ). Rabbinic law accordingly holds that work required for the preparation of food is permissible on festival days, but not on the Sabbath or Day of Atonement; see also

   uch of the book of Exodus focused on aspects of the Tabernacle, the portable sanctuary that the Israelites construct while encamped at Mount Sinai. The present unit contains further regulations concerning the Tabernacle’s lamp and bread of display, focusing on their maintenance.

   he parashah closes with the second of two narratives in Leviticus that interrupt laws (the first being the story of Nadab and Abihu in
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.1-7">
    Leviticus 10
   </a>
   ). This passage recounts the crime of the blasphemer and its resolution. A man whose mother is Israelite and whose father is Egyptian utters God’s name in blasphemy, meaning that he may have done something such as curse God, saying, for example, “May such and such befall
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   !” An unusual facet of this story is that it records the name of the mother, Shelomith (an Israelite), along with her tribal ancestry, information not provided for the father (see
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_24.10-23">

   THE STORY OF THE BLASPHEMER (24:10–16)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The story of the blasphemer touches on a number of issues in addition to the desecration of God’s name: What is the status of a person from a “mixed marriage” of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian man? To what extent do Israelite laws apply to such a person?

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The Hebrew identifies the offender first as “a son of an Israelite woman,” then adds, “and he is a son of an Egyptian man.” The blasphemer’s mixed ancestry seems central to this episode. Since his mother is Israelite but not his father, he has become a member of the clan but is not considered a full-fledged Israelite (
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_23.1-9">
    Deuteronomy 23:8–9
   </a>
   ). The man’s mixed ancestry raises the question of whether those not considered full-fledged Israelites can be held liable for blasphemy as Israelite citizens. It is noteworthy that no overt criticism is made about the marriage itself.

   Blasphemy consists of pronouncing the divine name in a curse against God, that is, uttering an imprecation against the Deity that includes God’s name (see
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 22:27
   </a>
   , which prohibits it). In I Kings 21:1–16, Queen Jezebel frames a landowner named Naboth for the crime of blasphemy in order to have him stoned to death so that her husband can obtain Naboth’s land.

    </b>
   </i>
   The author takes great care to note the name, lineage, and tribe of the blasphemer’s mother—the only place in the Bible where her name appears. This unusual attention to the lineage of the blasphemer’s mother may be part of a subtle condemnation of the tribe of Dan and their northern Israelite temple, which the Jerusalemite priesthood considered illegitimate. The mention of her lineage could also indicate Shelomith’s prominence in the community.

   A
   <small>
    PRIEST MAY NOT
   </small>
   come in contact with a corpse except when the deceased is a close relative (
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
    21:1–3
   </a>
   ). The list of relatives does not mention the wife.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   How do we account for the text’s silence concerning the wife? The Torah gives two examples of a husband’s burying a wife: Abraham buries Sarah (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_23.1-20">
    Genesis 23
   </a>
   ), and Jacob buries Rachel (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_35.1-36.43">
    Genesis 35
   </a>
   ). But these cases do not pertain to priests and thus do not shed light on this law.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   One could claim that the wife’s absence from the list of relatives reflects her more marginal status. As Katarzyna Grosz observes after studying documents from the 14th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   , “women do not become members of their husband’s lineage—only their children do.…[The women] could be termed as a ‘foreign element’ in their husbands’ families” (“Some Aspects of the Position of Women in Nuzi,” in
   <i>
    Women’s Earliest Records,
   </i>
   ed. B. S. Lesko, 1989, p. 178).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Yet one could also argue the reverse: no mention is made because none is necessary—because the wife is included ipso facto. Three lines of evidence support this interpretation. First is the idea that
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.9-21">
    Leviticus 20:11
   </a>
   expresses about a unity between husband and wife. According to this verse, the nakedness of the mother is equivalent to that of the father, implying that the two are as one. Second,
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_2.4-25">
    Genesis 2:24
   </a>
   expresses the unity of the couple by stating that the two become one flesh. Third, the Torah in several places includes a wife without mentioning her (see at
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.8-20">
    Leviticus 10:14
   </a>
   ); in other words, the writer expects readers to keep wives in mind.

   While both interpretations remain plausible in

   neither can be confirmed.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   If a priest may not bury his wife, who then buries her? The law in
   <i>
    parashat Emor
   </i>
   permits the priest to bury his mother, and thus a priest’s wife can definitely be buried by her son. If there is no son, then the female members of the household, or members of her family of origin (if they are not priests) can still come in contact with her corpse and bury her.

   </b>
   (
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
    21:1–2
   </a>
   ). These verses stipulate that
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   (priests) may not come into contact with a corpse, with the exception of close relations. The Rabbis of the Talmud later applied this list of close relatives to all mourners. That is, the relatives for whom a Jew sits shivah are those enumerated in
   <i>
    Emor
   </i>
   , with the Rabbis’ additions of wives and married sisters (BT
   <i>
    Mo’ed Katan
   </i>
   20b). The Rabbis interpreted the clause “except for the relatives that are closest (literally ‘flesh’) to him…he may defile himself” as a veiled reference to a wife (Midrash
   <i>
    Sifra, Emor
   </i>
   1.4).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In spelling out the rabbinic definition of marriage, the Mishnah obliges a husband to bury his deceased wife—and then raises the issue of what constitutes a proper burial. One rabbi’s answer takes for granted the vital role of women professionals in public mourning:
   <a id="page_742">
   </a>
   “Even the poorest husband in Israel must hire at least two flute-players and one wailing woman” (
   <i>
    K’tubot
   </i>
   4:4).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In general, the laws of mourning treat men and women with parity. Women mourn, and are mourned, with only minor differences from men.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    <b>
     A widow…such he may not marry

   </i>
   (
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.14">
    21:14
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis preserved these biblical prohibitions limiting which women a man of priestly origin could marry. In fact, they went so far as to say that
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   are hot-headed and sometimes divorce their wives without good reason; upon calming down, they then discover they cannot take their divorced wives back. To save
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   from this predicament, the Rabbis instituted a special bill of divorce for
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   that takes longer to prepare and would not be completed until the
   <i>
    kohein
   </i>
   has regained his composure. This would give him an opportunity to call off the divorce proceedings before it is too late (BT
   <i>
    Bava Batra
   </i>
   160b).

   </a>
   ).
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_23.1-44">
    Leviticus 23
   </a>
   provides information about the Sabbath, the New Moon, Pesach, Shavuot, New Year, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot. These verses address the people in the second person masculine plural and nowhere is there any reference to women. Thus, one must inquire: were women, too, expected to offer a paschal lamb, blow the shofar, dwell in a sukkah, refrain from work on the Sabbath and holy days, and afflict themselves on Yom Kippur?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Rabbis answered these questions in different ways and they also discussed women’s obligations for Purim and Chanukah, two festivals that are not mentioned in the Torah. The basic premise is that women are considered responsible for obeying all of Judaism’s negative commandments and for observing most of the positive commandments, including celebrating Shabbat and the festivals. A man should cause his children and household to rejoice on a festival (BT
   <i>
    P’sachim
   </i>
   109a). However, the Rabbis explicitly exempted women from hearing the shofar on Rosh HaShanah; dwelling in a sukkah during the Sukkot festival; waving the
   <i>
    lulav
   </i>
   on Sukkot; and counting the
   <i>
    Omer
   </i>
   between Pesach and Shavuot. Since these are all commandments to be performed at fixed times of the year, they conform to the exemption of women from time-bound commandments prescribed in Mishnah
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   1:7.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   However, the Talmud specifically obligated women to other time-bound festival observances. These included
   <i>
    Kiddush
   </i>
   (sanctification of wine) on the Sabbath (BT
   <i>
    B’rachot
   </i>
   20b) and, according to most authorities, on the festivals as well; kindling Sabbath and festival lights and the Chanukah lamp (BT
   <i>
    Shabbat
   </i>
   23a); listening to
   <i>
    M’gillat Esther
   </i>
   on Purim (BT
   <i>
    M’gillah
   </i>
   4a); and eating matzah (BT
   <i>
    P’sachim
   </i>
   43b) and drinking four cups of wine at the Passover seder. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi justified women’s inclusion in these Chanukah (BT
   <i>
    Shabbat
   </i>
   23a), Pesach, and Purim rituals (BT
   <i>
    M’gillah
   </i>
   4a), on the grounds that women, too, were included in these miracles. Women, like men, are required to fast and afflict themselves in various ways on the Day of Atonement and to refrain from doing any work (BT
   <i>
    Sukkah
   </i>
   28b); they are also obligated to observe all other mandated fast days. [In the course of the 20th century, liberal movements in Judaism fostered women’s equal participation in all aspects of festival and holiday observance and introduced a number of new rituals, some of which focus specifically on women and female experience.

This narrative, by noting the Egyptian lineage of the father of the man who cursed God, implies that his mother was responsible for her son’s horrendous behavior because she had married an Egyptian. Some of the Rabbis disagreed and exempted her from wrong-doing, suggesting that the Egyptian man slipped into her bed unbeknownst to her, and this was why her offspring

   of the Temple (70

   .) eliminated the conditions that required priests to preserve certain laws of purity, the influence of such laws nevertheless continues. According to
   <i>
    Emor
   </i>
   , a priest (
   <i>
    kohein
   </i>
   ) has to guard against possible defilement at all times. A movie produced by several religiously observant students at the Ma’ale School of Television, Film, and the Arts in Jerusalem illustrates some consequences of these laws for their contemporary circles.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Entitled “Cohen’s Wife,” this film concerns Rivki Cohen, a young ultra-orthodox woman who opens the door slightly for a strange man who has come asking for
   <i>
    tzedakah
   </i>
   (charity). The stranger then forces his way in and rapes her. This crime renders Rivki ritually impure to her husband. The film deals with how the husband approaches the rabbinical court as to whether he—a
   <i>
    kohein
   </i>
   —must divorce his wife because she is now defiled.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This deeply moving film depicts a loving couple that desperately wants to remain married, while at the same time wanting to observe Jewish law. The wife turns out to have the key to saving the marriage—by not saying the words “I was raped,” and certainly not to her husband. Thus, since there was no witness, the husband could seek a sympathetic set of rabbis who simply would pretend that the rape had not taken place, thus allowing the couple to remain intact.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The problem, of course, is the guilt and confusion that both the wife and husband feel after the rabbinic decision; have they themselves resolved the problem or not? Will they be able to live their lives in peace with their guilty secret? This movie, like most made at Ma’ale, exposes viewers to the human conflicts, tragedies, and even comic situations that arise when people wish to live both according to Jewish law and to their honest feelings.

   While we can expect the laws of Leviticus to have a strong impact primarily in certain religious circles, other ideas in
   <i>
    Emor
   </i>
   continue to have subtle ramifications for general society. One example is the stress found in
   <i>
    Emor
   </i>
   on the ideal of physical “perfection.”
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
    Leviticus 21:17–20
   </a>
   disqualifies a descendant of Aaron from carrying out the rituals of the priesthood if he is subject to certain physical deficiencies or disfigurations. Physical imperfection, it seems, impairs holiness.

   While the priest’s bodily perfection may no longer be a Jewish necessity, the idea and expectation of bodily perfection have become a cultural goal of the wider American Jewish population, with terrible consequences—particularly for women, regardless of age. By now most people are aware that many American Jewish girls starve themselves or over-exercise to become thin, or they have surgery on their noses and elsewhere to be more beautiful. So too, older Jewish women undergo a wide range of plastic surgery to remain attractive. On this drive among young girls to be pretty at all costs—and to be intolerant of those
   <a id="page_744">
   </a>
   who are not—see
   <i>
    The JGirl’s Guide: The Young Jewish Woman’s Handbook for Coming of Age
   </i>
   (co-authored by me, Penina Adelman, and Ali Feldman, 2005). Mothers pass the goal of beauty on to their daughters, and men reinforce it. By manipulating women’s self-confidence about their appearance, the beauty industry has become a highly lucrative business. The point is that each girl or woman considers herself to be defective or imperfect, no matter what she does. This idea derives from the notion that there
   <i>
    is
   </i>
   such a thing as bodily perfection, a concept presented in
   <i>
    Emor.
   </i>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The motivation to be beautiful by any means should not be dismissed out of hand as misguided, however. After all, the Bible and much of Western culture frequently equate beauty with goodness.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Several admired matriarchs—Sarah and Rebekah, for example—are beautiful, even “very beautiful.” In fact, one term for beauty in the Bible actually uses forms of the word
   <i>
    tov
   </i>
   (good), further promoting such associations. Thus, kindly Rebekah is
   <i>
    tovat mar’eh
   </i>
   (“exceedingly beautiful,”
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24:16
   </a>
   ). And Esther is touted for her beauty, which enables her to carry out later virtuous deeds. Based on these cases and many others, I suggest that the Torah’s preference for beauty is a clear theme that appears in many places, including the
   <i>
    Emor
   </i>
   section on the necessity for physical perfection among priests.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   By and large it is not only the preference for beauty that has spilled into Western culture, but also the equation between beauty and goodness. Children’s fairy tales typically feature the beautiful princess who is good, the handsome prince who is also good, and the ugly witch who is evil. Psychologists have found that people who are attractive are trusted more than those who are not; handsome people are likely to rise in the ranks of their organizations and be elected to office. Physically attractive individuals, research shows, are perceived as more intelligent, sociable, talented, and moral. There is even a term for this prejudice: beautyism—the idea that what is beautiful is good, and what is not beautiful is bad. Beautyism is a danger to the self-esteem of those who are not physically attractive and can lead to arrogance among those who are. While efforts to urge children to look beyond physical appearance may address race and disability, they almost never deal with beauty. This silent prejudice is thus able to persist and be reinforced throughout popular culture, religious instruction, and the education system.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Some passages in the Bible, however, do not equate beauty with goodness, possibly in an attempt to counteract the heavy emphasis on the subtle equation elsewhere. Ruth, for example, is a model of goodness but is never called beautiful. More notable is the description of the “woman of valor”
   <i>
    (eshet chayil)
   </i>
   in Proverbs 31, which explicitly repudiates beauty as a criterion for virtue: “Grace is deceptive, and beauty is illusory; it is for her fear of
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   that a woman is to be praised” (31:30). Yet the negation can be also read as an admission that the cultural norm is otherwise.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    Emor
   </i>
   ’s implication that a priest must not remain married to his wife if she is raped is a case of punishing the victim. So, too,
   <i>
    Emor
   </i>
   ’s exclusion of a blind descendant of Aaron from priestly activities punishes the handicapped. Contemporary society tries not to punish rape victims or disabled individuals. While it is true that we have tried to distance ourselves from these two ancient ideas, we have made hardly any progress with regard to the obverse, that is, unfairly rewarding those who are physically beautiful and punishing those who are not.
