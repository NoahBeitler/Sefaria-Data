   (“Jethro”) records the transformative encounter between God and Israel at Mount Sinai, the moment when God and the people Israel become wedded in an exclusive covenantal relationship. After experiencing how God bore them “on eagles’ wings” (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    19:4
   </a>
   ) from Egypt, the people willingly accept God’s proposal: If they listen to God’s voice and obey the covenant, they will become God’s “treasured possession,” a “kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    19:5–6
   </a>
   ). The blare of a ram’s horn and a spectacular display of smoke, thunder, and lightning herald the appearance of the Divine. Then, the revelation of the commandments stipulate what it means to walk in God’s ways.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   The teachings of the Decalogue, also known popularly as the Ten Commandments, guide the Israelites in their relationships with God and other human beings. The first four commandments charge the Israelites to worship God faithfully and to observe the Sabbath. The last five prohibit taking what is not yours: a human life, another man’s wife, or someone else’s property, either directly through stealing or indirectly through false testimony or coveting another’s belongings. The fifth commandment—a bridge between the precepts focused on the Divine and those concerned with humans—mandates reverence of one’s mother and father.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In the Decalogue, women are mentioned as mothers, wives, daughters, and servants. Elsewhere in the parashah, women play a more elusive role. Zipporah appears in the beginning of the portion, when Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro, travels to the wilderness of Sinai in order to reunite Moses with his wife, Zipporah, and their two sons. What is puzzling about this scene is that an earlier passage in Exodus suggests that Moses brought his family with him to Egypt (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E4-20">
    4:20
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E4-24">
    24–26
   </a>
   ). When and why had she “been sent home” (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_18.1-27">
    18:2
   </a>
   ) to Midian?

   Even more perplexing and disturbing for many contemporary readers is the question of whether women were included in, or excluded from, the revelation at Sinai. How should we interpret Moses’ command to “not go near a woman” (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-15">
    19:15
   </a>
   )? Does the masculine language of the laws address women? These issues are explored at

   oses’ Midianite father-in-law, Jethro, joins the Israelites at Sinai and advises Moses how to create a system for resolving internal disputes. This passage serves as a transition between the liberation from Egypt and the revelation of God’s teachings. The positive relations between Israelite and non-Israelite at the start of this parashah stand in direct contrast to the conclusion of the preceding parashah, which expresses permanent hostility toward Amalek (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e17-16">
    17:16
   </a>
   ). The desire to contrast “good gentile” with “bad gentile” may have dictated the placement of this episode.

   The narration implies that Moses’ wife and children were living in Midian while Moses returned to Egypt to free the Israelites. Yet no notice was given earlier that Zipporah and her sons were dispatched back to Midian. When last we encountered Zipporah, she was traveling with Moses and her sons from Midian to Egypt (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E4-20">
    4:20
   </a>
   ). On the way, she saved her family by circumcising her son, the mysterious “bridegroom of blood” incident (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E4-24">

   The Hebrew verb here can mean divorce, so some interpreters claim that Moses had divorced her; yet this explanation is not persuasive since Jethro refers to her as Moses’ wife in v. 6. The reason for the separation is not explained.

   </i>
   In the Torah, the explanation of a name by the mother or father is a standard feature of the birth of sons, but never of daughters. This may be due to the patrilineal nature of Israelite society: the names of boys often become clan and tribal names, while girls’ names did not.

   Several passages in the Torah refer to this mountain as Sinai, while others call it Horeb (see
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E3-6">
    3:1
   </a>
   ). One explanation is that two different traditions existed about the name of this mountain; another possibility is that the term Horeb should be understood as the name of the larger region, while “wilderness of Sinai” and “Mount Sinai” refer to a specific area or peak in the boundaries of Horeb. People have long sought to locate this mountain, identifying it with Jebel Musa or other particular mountains in the Sinai Peninsula or northwestern Arabia. However, such efforts seem to misconstrue the way the Bible presents Sinai as a phenomenon that transcends space and time (Carol Meyers,
   <i>
    Exodus,
   </i>
   2005, p. 144).

   </i>
   Moses, acting as the host, warmly greets his father-in-law; but no mention is made of him welcoming his wife and sons. This imbalance may reflect the formal hospitality customs common in the biblical world. Or, rather than suggesting the neglect of his family, this may stem from the Torah’s intent to highlight Moses’ remarkable relations with his Midianite father-in-law.

   JETHRO RECOMMENDS DELEGATING JUDICIAL AUTHORITY (18:13–27)

   After noticing the cumbersome and inefficient nature of Moses’ role as the sole judge of the people, Jethro makes a suggestion. Deuteronomy’s version of this episode omits Jethro’s role (
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#d1-9">
    Deuteronomy 1:9–18

   ), which is hardly surprising since ascribing Israel’s judiciary structure to a foreigner is quite remarkable.

   meaning officers with a range of administrative duties. The judicial system outlined by Jethro is hierarchical and quasi-military, which makes sense since Israel’s organization in the wilderness is most akin to a military formation. The noun “judge”
   <i>
    (shofet)
   </i>
   is not used in this passage. While presumably women were excluded from such leadership positions, Judges 4–5 records that Deborah served as a judge and prophet.

   he encounter at Sinai forms the literary and ideological heart of the Torah. Israel’s experience at “God’s mountain” is presented as the determining factor in its spiritual and national identity. It is here that God proposes and Israel accepts the covenant (
   <i>
    b’rit

   ) that creates a legal and binding relationship between a people and its deity, a relationship not found elsewhere in the ancient world. This covenant also serves to bind individuals into a nation, for Israel’s communal acceptance of the terms of the covenant (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-8">
    19:9
   </a>
   ) imposes upon the people collective rewards and punishments (

   which normally refers to a private accumulation of valuable property (see Ecclesiastes 2:8). While this universal deity could potentially claim possession of any nation on earth, God chooses Israel as a personal treasure. The notion of Israel’s exclusive relationship with God—found here and in the subsequent verse—is problematic for many modern readers. However, in the polytheistic world of the ancient Near East, it was assumed that a deity would have a special connection to a single people.

   These words clarify Israel’s unique role as God’s covenant partner. The words “kingdom” and “nation” express the idea that national autonomy and ethnic distinctiveness are essential for the fulfillment of Israel’s mission. Further, just as the priests devote their lives to the service of the Divine and convey God’s will to the people, so Israel is to assume this role among the nations. The word “holy” (
   <i>
    kadosh

   ) designates that which is set apart from the profane or ordinary. (For more on biblical notions of holiness, see

   The presence of women in the

    Deuteronomy 31:9–13
   </a>
   ; Joshua 8:35; perhaps II Kings 23:2; Nehemiah 8:2–3). This is not the case at Sinai. However, since the event at Sinai represents the paradigmatic revelation to the Israelite nation, it seems unlikely that women would have been excluded.

   God instructs Moses to make sure that the people are in a pure state, expressed here by the root
   <i>

   “holy.” Although this verse focuses only on washing clothes, other passages specify that attaining a physically holy state also involves washing oneself as well as avoiding sexual relations and contact with impurities (see at

     <b>

     </b>
    </i>
   </a>
   In vv. 14–15, Moses implements the instructions received in vv. 10–13. He repeats God’s charge to the Israelites to stay pure and launder their clothes, while he adds the command not to approach a woman. The prohibition seems to concern sexual intercourse (based on how the synonymous verb
   <i>
    k-r-v
   </i>
   is used in
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#l18-14">
    Leviticus 18:14

   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.13">

   ;
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_22.13-29">
    Deuteronomy 22:14
   </a>
   ; Isaiah 8:3). According to
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#L15-16">
    Leviticus 15:18
   </a>
   , sexual intercourse renders both parties ritually impure, so that they may not have access to the Sanctuary or objects deemed holy. By specifying a common action that would preclude individuals from participation in the sacred event of revelation, Moses amplifies God’s directions to ensure the purity of the people.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The present translation inserts the phrase “[the men among]” in order to show that although the inclusion of women is generally assumed, in this particular verse the imperative must be addressed to men.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Some scholars infer from this that Moses spoke only to the men; they argue that if women were included in the covenant community, Moses would have phrased his warning in mutual terms, something akin to: “Men and women do not go near each other.” However, this suggestion can be challenged by the fact that biblical Hebrew rarely addresses sexual relations in mutual terms. Instead, references to sexual relations usually contain a masculine subject and a female object: a man “knows” a woman, “lies” or “lies with” her, “approaches” her, or “comes to” her. This language presents the male as the active figure and the female as the passive party. Although this linguistic pattern is problematic for contemporary readers, it means that the address to men in this verse cannot be used to argue that women were excluded from the revelation at Sinai.

   , literally “in a voice,” is enigmatic. The identification of God’s “voice” with thunder is found in several biblical passages (Psalm 18:14; 29:3); however, since the focus here is on God’s discourse with Moses and Israel, “voice” is the more likely meaning. The content of Moses’ conversation with God is unclear. Some commentators think that this verse refers to the Decalogue, while others identify it with God’s instructions to Moses in vv. 21–22.

   he unique status of the Decalogue is due to the tradition, found in the framework of
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    Exodus 19–20
   </a>
   and
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_4.1-40">
    Deuteronomy 4–5
   </a>
   , that God recited these rules directly to the people, without the mediation of Moses. Only after the last commandment do the people demand Moses’ intervention because they dread the terrifying display of divine power.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   While
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    Exodus 19–20
   </a>
   does not provide a specific title for this group of precepts, the label “Ten Words”
   <i>
    (aseret had’varim)
   </i>
   is found elsewhere (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-28">
    34:28
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu4-13">
    Deuteronomy 4:13
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="49_chapter_46.xhtml#deu10-4">
    10:4
   </a>
   ). The ancient Jewish Greek-speaking community in Egypt translated that Hebrew phrase as
   <i>
    deka logoi
   </i>
   (“ten words”), resulting in the alternative English name “Decalogue.” The more common English title “Ten Commandments” is somewhat misleading since the Torah itself does not use the term “commandment” (
   <i>
    mitzvah
   </i>
   ) in conjunction with this passage, nor is it clear that every one of its utterances constitutes a command (see at v. 2). Likewise, uncertainty exists as to how to divide these verses into ten discrete commandments. Verse 3 may be grouped with v. 2 or with vv. 4–5, while the prohibition against coveting in v. 14 may be considered a single law or two distinct commandments.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This passage has no specific target audience (such as priests or judges); nor does it refer to any societal institution (like kingship or the Temple) or any specific historical context (though v. 12 may reflect Israel’s residence in Canaan). Reward for adherence is mentioned only once (v. 12), while punishments are largely omitted (except for v. 5). Recognition of divine authority and of prior acts of redemption, established in v. 2, seems to be the primary motivating factor for obeying these stipulations.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_20.1-14">
    Exodus 20:2–14
   </a>
   consistently uses the second-person singular, perhaps to impress upon the audience their obligation as individuals to adhere to these teachings. Because the language of address is grammatically masculine, one might infer that these regulations address only men. However, in biblical Hebrew, masculine grammatical form does not specify social gender unless it is used to refer to a definite, particular person. So-called masculine forms often have a gender-neutral function. (See, for example,
   <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu28-64">
    Deuteronomy 28:68
   </a>
   , where masculine singular address at the start of the verse is equivalent to both masculine and feminine plurals at the end of the verse.) Therefore, the Decalogue’s masculine singular address does not necessarily mean that only men were addressed. (See further at
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 21:2

   The Torah later records that God also engraved the “Ten Words” upon two stone tablets, which Moses received on the top of Mount Sinai (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e31-18">
    31:18
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu4-13">
    Deuteronomy 4:13
   </a>
   ). Furthermore, these tablets were to be deposited in the Ark of the Covenant, which was to be placed in the “Holy of Holies” of the Tabernacle (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.10-40">
    25:16
   </a>
   ). This is akin to the ancient Near Eastern practice of storing a treaty document in the sanctuary of a temple so that the deity could serve as the guardian of its implementation. The medium of stone, as opposed to parchment or papyrus, underlines the permanent validity of these precepts.

   INTRODUCTION (20:1)

  <div class="tab-enin">
   This verse establishes that God speaks the Decalogue directly to the people. In contrast, the precepts that follow in the Covenant Collection, like the Tabernacle instructions, are communicated through Moses (see
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo20-19">
    20:19

  <div class="head2" id="exo_vv.2-14">
   THE COMMANDMENTS (20:2–14)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The “Ten Words” have a discernable arrangement, with a separation between those that dictate correct behavior regarding God and those that apply to the treatment of other human beings. Note, for instance, that the first statement opens with “your God,” while the last one closes with “your neighbor.” Further, the first five utterances mention “
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   your God” five times, while the second five contain no references to God. The fifth commandment, which mandates honoring one’s parents, serves as a bridge between the two halves; it contains both religious and social aspects, and both God and parents claim authority over the individual. Within each grouping of five, the directives are arranged in order of decreasing severity. (These foundational precepts are repeated, with minor variations, in
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#dd5-6">
    Deuteronomy 5:6–18

   </a>
   This verse, in which God is self-identified as the One who took Israel out of Egypt, serves as the introduction and basis for all that follows. It is because God redeemed Israel from Egypt that God reserves the right to command exclusive fidelity (v. 3).

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   This command of fidelity to only one god is unique in the ancient Near East. Texts from this period present a generally tolerant religious environment: the gods did not mind the worship of their “peers” as long as their own needs (in the form of donations of precious goods, food, and drink) were not neglected. This precept does not negate the existence of other gods, and may be pre-monotheistic (see also
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#d6-8">
    Deuteronomy 6:4
   </a>
   ). Biblical scholars compare Israel’s covenant with God to ancient Near Eastern international vassal-overlord treaties. Marriage is another, more familiar relationship that shared this kind of exclusivity; hence, the prophets develop the metaphor of God as husband and Israel as wife (see Isaiah 54, Jeremiah 3, Hosea 1–3).

    </b>
   </i>
   Prevailing Jewish tradition understands vv. 4–6, forbidding the worship of images, as a continuation of v. 3. Yet if v. 3 is interpreted as the first stipulation, then v. 4 begins the second. The reason offered for the prohibition is that God communicated at Sinai only through a voice (
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu11-9-1">
    Deuteronomy 4:12–16
   </a>
   ). Idols are therefore incompatible with the historic self-disclosure of God’s nature. Further, the worship of God through fixed representations limits the range of the Deity’s attributes.

Paradoxically, it is the conspicuous omission of the wife that signals her inclusion here: if she is not addressed by “you,” then are we to assume that the verse burdens her with work—while her children, slaves, and draft animals rest? This can hardly be the case. As Tikva Frymer-Kensky writes, “the omission of a phrase ‘and your wife’ shows that the ‘you’ that the law addresses includes both women and men, each treated as a separate moral agent” (“Deuteronomy,”
   <i>
    Women’s Bible Commentary,

   The importance of respect for parents is underlined by its inclusion in the first five precepts, which concern proper behavior toward God. This command is the only one in the Decalogue for which a reward, extended residence in the land of Israel, is promised. It may reflect the legal custom found in other ancient Near Eastern texts that inheritance of property is conditional upon proper treatment of parents in their old age. The Torah outlines various offenses against parents, some of which are considered capital crimes: striking, cursing, insulting, and insubordination (as in
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu21-15">

   </i>
   Adultery is defined in Israel and the ancient Near East as sexual relations between a betrothed or married woman and any man other than her fiancé or husband. A married man was guilty of adultery only if his sexual partner officially “belonged” to another, since a man could legitimately take another unmarried woman as wife. The Torah’s legal texts consider adultery a capital offense and demand the execution of both the woman and her paramour (see
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi18-20">
    Leviticus 18:20

   The traditional paragraphing in a Torah scroll properly breaks this verse into two clauses. In the first, the object of “covet” is “house,” which should be understood as “household” (as in
   <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g7-1">
    Genesis 7:1
   </a>
   ). As the present translation indicates, the second clause enumerates those objects that constitute an Israelite household, starting with the most important, one’s wife.

  <div class="tab-enin">

     <a href="#chap-fn14a-3" id="chap-fn014a-3">

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   This refers to an intense desire for an object, and perhaps the scheming to acquire it (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo34-24">
    34:24
   </a>
   ; Joshua 7:21). See also at

    </b>
   </i>
   Some scholars have argued that if the Decalogue were addressed to women as well as men, it would have included a parallel prohibition against coveting “your neighbor’s husband.” But the lack of mutuality here does not rule out that the previous provisions of the Decalogue addressed themselves to both men and women. Rather, each provision is addressed to whomever it applies. In ancient Israel, marriage was not a symmetrical arrangement: typically a man was in a position to take a woman into the household as a wife, but typically a woman could not take a man into her household as a husband. That alone would seem to account for why “husband” is not mentioned in this verse, as Tikva Frymer-Kensky has pointed out (“Deuteronomy,”

   he overwhelming display of divine might inspires such fear that the people withdraw and demand that Moses assume the role of mediator (vv. 15–16). The belief that seeing God could be lethal is found elsewhere in the Bible (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge32-31">

   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e33-20">
    Exodus 33:20
   </a>
   ; Judges 6:22–23; 13:22). The revelatory experience at Sinai becomes the basis for the first instruction following the Decalogue (vv. 19–23): Because Israel’s experience of God at Sinai was auditory and not directly visual, their worship of God should exclude physical representations. This passage introduces the precepts of the Covenant Collection that follow in the next parashah.

   to command the people to sanctify themselves, wash their clothes, and be ready for the divine revelation, God emphasizes that the people should be instructed not to go up or touch the mountain (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-8">
    19:10–13

   ). Moses begins by faithfully repeating God’s commands, yet he concludes, not by reiterating God’s warning not to touch the mountain, but instead by admonishing the Israelites not to go near a woman (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-15">
    19:15
   </a>
   ). Feminists have wrestled with this disturbing verse and its implications. Does this formulation mean that Moses was only speaking to the men? Moses seems to have subverted God’s command to all the people by speaking only to half the Israelites.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Moses’ striking deviation from God’s command is troubling well beyond the feminist focus. Moses’ alteration of God’s command raises the central question of who is the final authority on what God really says. Which version of the command is authoritative? Is Moses faithfully transmitting God’s words? Is the text accurately presenting God’s instructions? And, ultimately, what gives Moses or the text the right to report God’s words differently from the way in which they were originally delivered?

   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-15">

One tradition concludes that Jethro learned of the revelation at Mt. Sinai. Another sage suggests that Jethro heard about the parting of the Sea of Reeds.

   <i>
    shalach
   </i>
   ) both here and in the description of divorce in
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu24-1">
    Deuteronomy 24:1
   </a>
   , the Rabbis concluded that Moses divorced his wife, though they debated whether he did so with a
   <i>
    get
   </i>
   (a bill of divorce) or simply by an oral statement (
   <i>
    M’chilta, Amalek

   3).

   (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    19:3
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis were certain that divine words contained no repetition. Thus,
   <i>
    M’chilta, Bachodesh
   </i>
   2, explains that
   <i>
    house of Jacob
   </i>
   refers to the Israelite women, while
   <i>
    children of Israel
   </i>
   refers to the men. (In 1917, Sarah Schenirer of Cracow, Poland, founded what is now a worldwide network of Orthodox schools for girls, which takes its name from the rabbinic interpretation of this verse:
   <i>
    Beis Yaakov,
   </i>
   The House of Jacob.) A second interpretation of this juxtaposition suggests that
   <i>
    Thus shall you say
   </i>
   was a divine directive that Moses should instruct the women in a mild tone, while the parallel verb
   <i>
    declare
   </i>
   implied that Moses should be strict with the men. The result was that God’s revelation was accessible to everyone.

   a feminist perspective,
   <i>
    Yitro
   </i>
   contains one of the most painful verses in the Torah. At the formative moment in Jewish history, when presumably the whole people of Israel stands in awe and trembling at the base of Mount Sinai waiting for God to descend upon the mountain and establish the covenant, Moses turns to the assembled community and says, “Be ready for the third day: do not go near a woman” (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-15">
    19:15
   </a>
   ). Moses wants to ensure that the people are ritually prepared to receive God’s presence, and an emission of semen renders both a man and his female partner temporarily unfit to approach the sacred (see
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#L15-16">
    Leviticus 15:16–18
   </a>
   ). But Moses does not say, “Men and women do not go near each other.” Instead, at this central juncture in the Jewish saga, he renders women invisible as part of the congregation about to enter into the covenant.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   These words are deeply troubling for at least two reasons. First, they are a paradigm of the treatment of women as “other,” both elsewhere in this portion and throughout the Torah. Again and again, the Torah seems to assume that the Israelite nation consists only of male heads of household. It records the experiences of men, but not the experiences of women. For example, the tenth commandment—“You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife” (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-14">
    20:14
   </a>
   )—presupposes a community of male hearers.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Second, entry into the covenant at Sinai is not just a one-time event, but an experience to be reappropriated by every generation (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#deu_29.9-28">
    Deuteronomy 29:13–14
   </a>
   ). Every time the portion is chanted, whether as part of the annual cycle of Torah readings or as a special reading for Shavuot, women are thrust aside once again, eavesdropping on a conversation among men, and between men and God. The text thus potentially evokes a continuing sense of exclusion and disorientation in women. The whole Jewish people supposedly stood at Sinai. Were we there? Were we not there? If we were there, what did we hear when the men heard “do not go near a woman”? If we were not there originally, can we be there now? Since we are certainly part of the community now, how could we not have been there at that founding moment?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Given the seriousness of these questions, it is important to note the larger narrative context of Moses’ injunction to the men not to go near a woman. When the Israelites arrive at Sinai on the third new moon after leaving Egypt, Moses twice ascends the mountain to talk with God. After he brings God the report that the people have agreed to accept the covenant, God gives Moses careful instructions for readying everyone for the moment of revelation: “Go to the people and warn them to stay pure today and tomorrow,” God says. “Let them wash their clothes. Let them be ready for the third day; for on the third day
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   will come down, in the sight of all the people, on Mount Sinai” (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-8">
    19:10–11
   </a>
   ). It is striking that
   <i>
    God’s
   </i>
   instructions to Moses are addressed to the whole community. It is
   <i>
    Moses
   </i>
   who changes them, who glosses God’s message, who assumes that the instructions are meant for only half the people. Thus, at this early stage in Jewish history, Moses filters and interprets God’s commands through a patriarchal lens. His words are a paradigm of the treatment of women, but a complex one. They show how Jewish tradition has repeatedly excluded women, but also the way in which that exclusion must be understood as a
   <i>
    distortion
   </i>
   of revelation.

   Interestingly, the Rabbis seem to have been disturbed by the implication of women’s absence from
   <a id="page_424">
   </a>
   Sinai, because they read women into the text in a variety of ways.
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   28.2 understands
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    Exodus 19:3
   </a>
   (“Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob and declare to the children of Israel”) to mean that “the house of Jacob” refers to the women and “the children of Israel” refers to the men. According to the midrash, the order of the verse suggests that God sent Moses to the women with the Torah
   <i>
    first.
   </i>
   Perhaps, the sages speculate, God regretted the mistake of not directly giving Eve the commandment concerning the forbidden fruit and so resolved not to repeat it. Besides, the Rabbis note, women are more careful in observing religious precepts, and they are the ones who will instruct their children. Rashi, commenting on the Mishnah
   <i>
    (Shabbat
   </i>
   9:3; BT
   <i>
    Shabbat
   </i>
   86a), interprets
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-15">
    Exodus 19:15
   </a>
   (“Do not go near a woman”) as a stricture specifically designed to enable Israel’s women to be present at Sinai. Since semen loses its power to create impurity after three days, Moses’ instruction to the men guarantees that women will remain ritually pure, even if they discharge residual semen during the Revelation. In other words, without ever naming Moses’ distortion of God’s words directly, the Rabbis sought to reverse its effects.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Several lessons can be drawn from this. One is the inseparability of revelation and interpretation. There is no revelation without interpretation; the foundational experience of revelation also involves a crucial act of interpretation. Second, we learn that the process of interpretation is ongoing. What Moses does, the Rabbis in this case seek to undo. While they reiterate and reinforce the exclusion of women in many contexts, they mitigate it in others. Third, insofar as the task of interpretation is continuing, it now lies with us. If women’s absence from Sinai is unthinkable to the Rabbis—despite the fact that they repeatedly reenact that absence in their own work—how much more must it be unthinkable to women and men today who function in communities in which women are full Jews? We have the privilege and the burden of recovering the divine words reverberating behind the silences in the text, recreating women’s understandings of revelation throughout Jewish history.
