   continues the theme of ritual purity that extends also to
   <i>
    parashat M’tzora
   </i>
   (
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_14.1-32">
    Leviticus 14–15
   </a>
   ). While
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    Leviticus 12
   </a>
   deals with the impurity of the woman who suffers from bleeding after childbirth,
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">
    Leviticus 15
   </a>
   will concern women and men who experience other kinds of genital discharge, both normal and abnormal. The intervening passage,
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_13.1-59">
    Leviticus 13–14
   </a>
   , concerns
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   —certain growths on skin, fabric, or leather. Traditionally the term has been translated as “leprosy,” but in English “leprosy” nowadays refers to something other than the conditions that the Torah describes.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    Parashat Tazria
   </i>
   thus includes two different subjects: (
   <i>
    1
   </i>
   ) the impurity from childbirth (
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    Leviticus 12
   </a>
   ); and (
   <i>
    2
   </i>
   ) the diagnosis of and regulations concerning skin, garments, and leather goods with certain kinds of surface eruptions (
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_13.1-59">
    Leviticus 13
   </a>
   ). Common to both, however, is the Israelite notion that physical conditions can produce a pollution that affects not only the party afflicted but also the sanctuary—the abode of the divine Presence. Therefore, the individuals affected must not “touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary” during prescribed periods (
   <a href="#levi_12.1-8">
    12:4
   </a>
   ). Being denied access to holiness extends to all whom the Torah considers impure
   <i>
    (tamei).
   </i>
   Certain sins also result in the pollution of Israel’s holy place (see, for example,
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L16-16">
    16:16
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L18-24">
    18:24–25
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#L20-3">
    20:3
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The common denominator regarding all the physical conditions that produce impurity is their association with the nexus of life and death.
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_11.1-12.16">
    Numbers 12
   </a>
   shows that the Israelites associated
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   with death: when Miriam is stricken with it, Aaron pleads, “Let her not be as a stillbirth [literally “a dead person”] which emerges from its mother’s womb with half its flesh eaten away!” (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_12-12">
    12:12
   </a>
   ). In the Torah, blood is synonymous with life (
   <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_6.9-9.29">
    Genesis 9:4
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
    Leviticus 17:14
   </a>
   ). Vaginal blood had an even greater significance for some of the ancients, who thought that it contained the seed that united with the male seed (semen) to produce a human being (Jacob Milgrom,
   <i>
    <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
     Leviticus 1–16
    </a>
   </i>
   , 1991, pp. 744, 767, 950). As menstrual fluid, it signified a lost opportunity to create life, thus linked with the process of death. This applied as well to the person who suffered from scale disease.

   The legislation in
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    Leviticus 12
   </a>
   and its focus upon the menstruating woman have had an enormous impact upon the lives of Jewish women. (For the practical consequences of impurity for women in ancient Israel, see the
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#page_657">
    introduction to
    <i>
     parashat M’tzora
    </i>
   </a>
   .) The view that women—via their normal, recurring
   <a id="page_638">
   </a>
   bodily functions—generate a pollution antagonistic to holiness served as a justification for women’s distance from the sacred throughout Jewish history. Women were disqualified from the Israelite priesthood perhaps because of fear that the sudden onset of menstruation would result in the clash of impurity and holiness, with presumed dire consequences. (For a different perspective, see
   <i>
    T’tzaveh,
   </i>
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#page_489">
    Another View
   </a>
   .) After the destruction of the Temple, which was the focus for the laws of ritual purity, women were often prevented from having contact with a Torah scroll, for example, because of the fear of giving affront to God by approaching in an impure state. The basis for many of the restrictions imposed upon the menstruant and the woman who gave birth was found not in Jewish law but rather in popular custom, which triumphed despite the objections of some rabbis. In addition to her participation in public religious life, the private life of the Jewish woman was affected: she and her husband were not allowed to engage in sexual relations during extensive periods of time, which greatly impacted her fertility and married life in general.

   he section that delineates purification rituals for women after childbirth differentiates between the birth of a son and that of a daughter. For the first 7 days after the birth of a son, and for 14 days after that of a daughter, the woman is in a ritual state equivalent to that of a menstruating woman (see
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">
    Leviticus 15
   </a>
   ). Afterward she must still abstain from contact with the sacred items or the sanctuary for another 33 days in the case of a son and 66 days in the case of a daughter. Leviticus offers no explanation for the differences in duration.

   Despite the fact that
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    Leviticus 12
   </a>
   does not mention bathing, most commentators assume that the act of ritual bathing or immersion marks the end of a woman’s period of impurity. Bathing signifies the termination of impurity from other causes (see
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#L14-8">
    14:8, 9

   IMPURITY AFTER THE BIRTH OF A MALE (12:1–4)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The notion that the woman who gave birth bears impurity is characteristic of many ancient cultures. Among Israel’s neighbors, it was common for the parturient (a woman about to give birth) to be quarantined and taboo, and special purification rituals were performed for the woman and her newborn among some groups. In Leviticus, this period of severe impurity (as opposed to the lesser degree described in
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    v. 4
   </a>
   ) terminates after seven days when the newborn is male and after fourteen days when the newborn is female; compare

   [Heb.
   <i>
    tazria
   </i>
   (which becomes the name of the parashah). The verb refers to a woman producing an offspring. In
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis 1:11–12
   </a>
   , it means “produce seed” or “bring forth seed” (regarding trees). The collective noun
   <i>
    zera
   </i>
   from the same root refers to offspring when used for persons, and to seed when used in agricultural contexts. Several texts mention a woman’s own offspring. See, for example, when an angel promises Hagar that her
   <i>
    zera
   </i>
   will be numerous (“descendants,”
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    Genesis 16:10
   </a>
   ; see also the blessing of Rebekah in
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.60">
    24:60
   </a>
   ). More often the references are to a man’s offspring (as when God makes the covenant with Abraham in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
    Genesis 17:7
   </a>
   ). Baruch Levine translates the clause with
   <i>
    tazria
   </i>
   as “when a woman is inseminated” (
   <i>
    Leviticus
   </i>
   , 1989, p. 72). That rendering, however, does not sufficiently highlight the active role of the woman in this parashah. —

   While this verse could be viewed as a sort of parenthetical reminder, a few commentators have suggested that the timing of a boy’s circumcision is coordinated with the diminishing of his mother’s impure status. It may be that the removal of the foreskin was viewed as a sort of purification ritual, so that both mother and son can achieve purity on consecutive days. Perhaps circumcision is delayed until the eighth day, when mother and (consequently) infant are in a less severe state of impurity, in order to prevent the contamination of the person who performs the circumcision. Therefore, circumcision may have been seen as a postpartum ritual associated with the separation of a male child from the impurity of his mother.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The renowned anthropologist Mary Douglas offers another interpretation of the role of circumcision in the context of postpartum impurity. She writes that circumcision played a protective role for mother and son, so that they were perceived as safer than a mother and daughter. This enhanced protection allowed the new mother and her son to venture out sooner, whereas a mother and her daughter had to lie low to avoid danger. Impurity was viewed as having a protective function. One might ask, “Protection from what?” Douglas’s theory assumes that the people of ancient Israel retained a strong fear of demons (for a possible allusion to such demonic forces, see
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.23-6.1">
    Exodus 4:24–26
   </a>
   ). The Torah, however, makes no obvious allusions to such a fear, nor does it make an obvious link between impurity and protection with regard to individuals who become

   for other reasons.

   This period differs from the initial seven-day period in that the woman now has access to the common sphere, including her husband. She remains impure only in regard to the sanctuary and holy objects. Thus, this section prescribes a total of forty days for the purification period following the birth of a boy.

   IMPURITY AFTER THE BIRTH OF A FEMALE (12:5)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The purification period for a woman after giving birth to a female child is 80 days, twice as long as after a male child. But the provisions follow the same two-step pattern: for the first two weeks, she is in a state of impurity comparable to a menstruating woman; and for sixty-six days she remains impure in regard to the sanctuary and items consecrated to it. The reason for the longer state of impurity after the birth of a girl is unclear. One proposed explanation is that the baby girl is a potential menstruant and mother, and so a future source of impurity. [Nicole Ruane challenges this view in her recent dissertation (“Male without Blemish: Sacrifice and Gender Ideologies in Priestly Ritual Law,” 2005). Instead, she argues that the text presumes the following worldview: “While it is imperfect that women give birth to boys, it is even less perfect when a woman bears a girl” (p. 164). Thus a woman who bears a boy is “rewarded” by having the time of her impurity halved. This possible understanding of birth and of gender would apply to certain priestly writings for which patrilineal continuity is a central concern; we have no information as to how widespread this idea might have been, nor how widely practiced this regulation was. —

   Other less likely proposals attribute the longer time following the birth of a girl to the ancients’ notion that male embryos were completely formed in forty-one days and females in eighty-two, or posit that the Torah is accounting to the mother the occasional vaginal bleeding which afflicts newborn females (Jonathan Magonet, “…The Riddle of Leviticus 12:5,” in
   <i>
    Reading Leviticus,
   </i>
   1996, pp. 144–52), or ascribe a protective function to the state of impurity (see at

    v. 3
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Some have suggested that the prolonged impurity of the baby girl’s mother reflects the social inferiority of females (a judgment not stated in the biblical text). Others counter that the greater potential for defilement does not indicate social status; after all, the handling of a human corpse defiles to a far greater degree than touching a dead lizard (compare
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#L11-29">
    11:29–31
   </a>
   and
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_19.1-22">

   When the mother reaches either the fortieth or eightieth day post-partum, she must take the necessary ritual steps to regain access to the holy sphere. Leviticus does not prescribe immersion for the woman’s post-partum purification (although the Rabbis assume a second immersion at this point, in addition to the ritual bathing at the end of seven or fourteen days). Rather, two sacrifices mark the end of the period of impurity.

    Leviticus 4

   The passage of time, the offering of sacrifices, and perhaps a ritual bathing (unwritten but apparently assumed) all contribute to her renewed ability to touch and eat sacred food and enter holy space.

   or a long time, biblical
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   has been equated with leprosy (also called Hansen’s Disease), but such a view is mistaken. This unit expects the skin eruptions that it describes to change in appearance or disappear at the end of seven or fourteen days (
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#L13-6">
    13:6–8
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#L13-27">

   </a>
   ,
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#L13-35">
    35–36
   </a>
   ), unlike what is known as leprosy today. The Torah appears to group together under the term
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   at least three different diseases that cause scaly or discolored skin: probably psoriasis, favus (a fungus infection), and vitiligo. These three conditions, however, do not change appreciably or disappear over the course of a week or two, which leads some scholars to hesitate in making a certain identification with
   <i>
    tzaraat.
   </i>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Modern translations use various terms for
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   (sometimes inconsistently), including “scaly affection,” “affection,” “eruption,” “scale disease,” and “leprosy.” Leviticus focuses on the appearance of the disease, not only upon the human body, but also upon fabrics, leather, and houses (
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#L13-47">
    13:47–59
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#L14-33">
    14:33–53
   </a>
   ). That is, Leviticus is primarily concerned not with the disease but with its manifestation.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_11.1-12.16">
    Numbers 12
   </a>
   helps explain why the appearance of
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   causes its inclusion in the Torah’s system of impurities. There, Miriam and Aaron, Moses’ older siblings, criticize Moses on account of his Cushite wife and dispute Moses’ preeminence as a prophet. God punishes Miriam; and she becomes stricken with
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   that is “as snow,” a reference to its whiteness or its flaky nature. Aaron then pleads with Moses on her behalf: “Let her not be as a stillbirth, who emerges from its mother’s womb with its flesh half-eaten away!” (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_12-12">
    12:12
   </a>
   ). Thus, the person afflicted with
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   seems like a decomposing corpse, as the skin has the appearance of wasting away. This accords with the suggestion (see the
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#page_637">
    introduction
   </a>
   ) that the common feature of all of the physical conditions that generate impurity is their association with death, a force antithetical to holiness.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The religions of the ancient Near East and ancient Greece regarded scale disease, like most maladies, as divine punishment, often for the violation of treaties.
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_11.1-12.16">
    Numbers 12
   </a>
   , along with II Kings 5 and II Kings 15 (II Chronicles 26), depicts
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   as a condition visited by God upon the sinner. In the case of Miriam, the Rabbis deduce that her sin is maligning Moses; they perceive the disease as the punishment for slander, among other sins. However, Leviticus never implies that the disease is a punishment from God. Rather, it refrains from imputing guilt to the affected individual and describes only the affliction and procedures for coping with its effect.

   Only Moses and Aaron initially receive the information concerning the diagnosis of scale disease. This contrasts with other legislation, which is to be conveyed to the people of Israel (compare
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    12:1

   or
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">

   <i>

   but not of other diseases, thus confirming the ritual—not medical—nature of the Torah’s concern.

   [Here the original JPS translators note: “Where a human being is declared impure by reason of

    tzaraat,
   </i>
   the traditional translation ‘leprosy’ has been retained without regard to modern medical terminology.” The reason for doing so, according to a member of the translation committee, was “to convey the horror that the Bible attaches to this affliction.” —

   If there were black hair growing in the suspect patch of skin, the priest would have declared the individual pure, as yellow hair is characteristic of the disease. Thus, the priest isolates the person for seven days.

   The first restriction is that the afflicted person should go about in ripped clothes. The second restriction means that the person’s hair shall be

   The individual’s isolation is not simply because scaly disease is deemed contagious, but also because of the fear that impurity would spread from the afflicted party to pure persons in the same structure. The impurity of scale disease and of corpses share the ability to pollute others under the same roof (see
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_19.1-22">
    Numbers 19:14
   </a>
   ). If the afflicted party remains in the community, others unaware of the impurity might enter the same structure. If that second individual then enters the sanctuary or eats sacred food, this would bring ritual impurity into a sacred context, leading to potentially disastrous consequences.

   one of the most puzzling, even disturbing, passages in Leviticus, a book concerned with holiness.
   <i>
    Tazria
   </i>
   challenges us, for it places childbirth among the sources of ritual impurity—from which one then needs purification (
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    12:1–8
   </a>
   )—and it reckons the birth of a daughter at twice the length of impurity as the birth of a son (
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    12:2
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#L12-4">
    4–5
   </a>
   ). In Leviticus, the commandment of purification after childbirth is consistent with the priestly insistence that blood contains or represents the life force. The priestly authors of Leviticus believe that blood, whether menstrual or post-partum, is so powerful as a source of life that only purification rituals can allow those who come into contact with it to rejoin their community. These rituals serve to contain the life force that places contaminated people outside the normative community, by returning them to a state of purity in which they can reenter God’s holy community.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Regardless of whether a woman bears a son or a daughter, the rituals of purification are the same. Why, then must a woman spend twice as long in a state of impurity following the birth of a girl than following the birth of a boy? Traditional interpreters have assumed that this is because the birth of a girl creates a kind of double impurity, possibly because newborn girls contain the latent capacity for menstruation and reproduction. But another point is also important here: in ancient Israel, baby girls arguably faced lives filled with more risks than did baby boys. Israel was a society in which economic value accrued primarily to sons. They remained part of their fathers’ households even when they married, inherited their families’ ancestral lands, and cared for their aging parents. In contrast, there is evidence to suggest that girls were sometimes thought of as expendable. In times of need, famine, and war, baby girls might suffer hunger and neglect, or even be abandoned and left to die.

   The priestly authors seem to be concerned about this situation and try to avert such tragedies by ensuring that baby girls stay in their mothers’ protective care for an extended period of time. This not only allows mother and daughter to bond tightly, but also ensures that the child is nursed and cared for. Thus, this troubling passage can be understood not as discrimination against women but as a way to promote God’s loving community—and to guarantee that women and men, both created in the divine image, are nurtured and protected.

   </i>
   (
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    12:2
   </a>
   ). The literal meaning of the word
   <i>
    tazria
   </i>
   , translated here as “at childbirth,” is that the woman “produces seed.” The talmudic rabbis—who had much to say about matters of conception, pregnancy, the formation of the embryo, and birth—played upon such a reading when some of them held that both woman and man can emit “seed.” A statement in the Talmud, frequently repeated in medieval biblical commentaries, asserts that “if the
   <a id="page_651">
   </a>
   woman emits her ‘seed’ first, she bears a male child; if the man emits his seed [semen] first, she bears a female child” (BT
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   25b, 28a, 31a; BT
   <i>
    B’rachot
   </i>
   60a). Presumably this comment models female genital secretions after the male seminal emission. Among other proofs, the Rabbis cite the language in this verse (BT
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   31a). Based on this theory, some rabbis speculated on how men should conduct their sexual lives in order to produce offspring of the desired gender. These suggestions were later anthologized in the mystically inspired medieval sex manual
   <i>
    The Holy Letter.
   </i>
   Another area of rabbinic interest was the genetic material from which the embryo is made. One opinion in the Talmud suggests that “there are three partners in [the procreation of] a person: the blessed Holy One, the father, and the mother” (BT
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   31a). The father is said to supply the seed (
   <i>
    mazria
   </i>
   ) of the body’s white substances, such as bones, sinews, nails, the brain, and the white of the eye. The mother supplies the seed (
   <i>
    mazraat)
   </i>
   of what the Rabbis consider to be the red substances, such as skin, flesh, blood, and the pupil of the eye. And God gives the child its breath, along with beauty of feature, eyesight, the powers of hearing and speaking, the ability to walk, and intellectual capabilities.

    12:5
   </a>
   ). Like modern commentators, the talmudic rabbis were puzzled by the doubling of the mother’s status of ritual impurity following the birth of a daughter. Mishnah
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   3:7 touches on this question in a rabbinic disagreement about embryology. According to the opinion of Rabbi Ishmael, the male embryo is fully fashioned after forty-one days, while the female embryo requires eighty-one days. The Talmud suggests that Rabbi Ishmael deduces these numbers from our verse: 7 plus 33 days for a male embryo, completed on the forty-first day; and 14 plus 66 days for a female embryo, completed on the eighty-first day. (Early Greek scholars, such as Aristotle and Hippocrates, also assumed a slower development of the female embryo.) However, a majority of rabbis in this debate disagree and affirm the equal development of male and female embryos at forty-one days. Elsewhere, the Talmud (BT
   <i>
    B’rachot
   </i>
   60a) considers whether, if the sex of the child is already determined at conception, it would be useful during the first forty days of a woman’s pregnancy to pray that the child be male. According to Mishnah
   <i>
    B’rachot
   </i>
   9:3, a prayer for a male baby at any point during pregnancy is to be considered “a vain prayer”; the Talmud, however, suggests that it may avail in certain circumstances if it is made in the first forty days of pregnancy.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">

     she shall bring…a purgation offering

   </i>
   (
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#L12-8">
    12:6
   </a>
   ). Again, the rabbis of the Talmud wondered why the postpartum woman should have to bring a
   <i>
    chatat
   </i>
   -offering to the priest and why he would need to make expiation on her behalf. While modern translations and commentaries usually construe this particular
   <i>
    chatat
   </i>
   -offering as unrelated to prior sin, the Rabbis did not easily dismiss the usual connection of the
   <i>
    chatat-
   </i>
   offering with sin (see
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.1-5.26">
    4:1
   </a>
   –
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#L5-11">
    5:13
   </a>
   ), even in the context of birth. As one tradition has it: “Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai was asked by his disciples: Why did the Torah ordain that a woman after childbirth should bring a sacrifice? He replied: When she kneels in bearing she swears spontaneously that she will have no more sex with her husband. The Torah, therefore ordained that she should bring a sacrifice” (BT
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   31b). This prompts some talmudic rabbis to a somewhat farfetched explanation for the double length of the mother’s impurity following the birth of a female child (see
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    12:5
   </a>
   ), based on the social attitudes of Jewish antiquity: They suggest that since everyone is happy about the birth of the boy, the mother quickly regrets her oath made while she was suffering the pains of labor; however, for a girl, whose birth prompts little celebration, regret at the oath does not set in for fourteen
   <a id="page_652">
   </a>
   days (BT
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   31b). Elsewhere, however, the Talmud (BT
   <i>
    K’ritot
   </i>
   26a) denies that the
   <i>
    chatat-
   </i>
   offering expiates the mother’s supposed sin of an unintended oath, and instead emphasizes its purifying function, thus anticipating contemporary commentators.

   The Rabbis derived their laws that require an immersion in the
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   in large measure from Leviticus (see at
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">

   ,
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#L15-16">

   , and
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#L11-29">
    11:36
   </a>
   ). They rooted the laws in a need to purify oneself ritually after certain conditions such as menstruation, male seminal emission, certain skin diseases, or contact with the dead. Removing impurities was a precondition for coming into contact with the holy, such as in approaching the sanctuary. With the destruction of the Temple, these laws remained mandatory for women and optional for men (see
   <i>
    Sh’mini,
   </i>
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#page_630">
    Post-biblical Interpretations

   ). While traditional Jews continue to use the
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   for “family purity,” most liberal Jews rarely enter the
   <i>
    mikveh.
   </i>
   When they do, they often enter the

   <i>
    k-v-h
   </i>
   that forms the word
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   appears for the first time in
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis (1:9)
   </a>
   : “Let the waters beneath the sky be collected [
   <i>
    yikavu
   </i>
   ] in one place.” Further, in the next verse emerges the expression
   <i>
    mikveh hamayim,
   </i>
   the name given to the seas, where
   <i>
    k-v-h
   </i>
   connotes “the gathering.” This first
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   is filled with
   <i>
    mayim
   </i>
   (water).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In the most archaic Hebrew script, the letter
   <i>
    mem
   </i>
   is a zigzagging line, drawn like waves that recall water. It is interesting to note that in many languages, the phoneme
   <i>
    “m”
   </i>
   is associated with “mother”
   <i>
    (ima, umm, mutter, mère, madre, mama,
   </i>
   etc.). The person who plunges into the ritual bath of the
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   —entirely surrounded by water, nude, without any barriers, and without touching its sides—resembles the fetus in the mother’s womb. The immersion in the
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   becomes a return to the sensations of the uterus, a return to our source and an act of renewal.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   You cannot know who you are without knowing whence you came. This return to what happened before is sometimes a way of softening the traumas of the past, to start anew after a difficult life experience. Conversely, sometimes it is a way to celebrate something precious in one’s life or something new. The word
   <i>
    kav
   </i>
   means “to be strong” or “strength” in Aramaic. The return to our source reinforces us.

    Spirituality.
   </i>
   Water appears first in the second verse of the story of Creation: “God’s spirit (
   <i>
    ruach
   </i>
   ) glided over the face of the waters” (
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    1:2
   </a>
   ). Thus, from the very beginning, water is forever linked to the divine, to the spiritual. Spirituality in relation to water is not necessarily about “purity.” Purity was originally attached to the mission of the Temple; since the Temple exists no more, purification need not apply to contemporary immersion in the
   <i>
    mikveh.
   </i>
   Going to a
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   is not
   <a id="page_653">
   </a>
   only a means of washing away the past, of removing the legacy of some “sin,” but also of preparing for the future. This is how the
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   functions when used to prepare for Shabbat and holidays or important moments in life. In this case,
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   is practiced by both women and men.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Traditional Jewish law requires that only women go to the
   <i>
    mikveh.
   </i>
   However, when the immersion in a
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   is part of a couple’s sexual life, if both partners go to the
   <i>
    mikveh,
   </i>
   they together assert that they are taking charge of their sex life. Making a visit to the
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   a regular part of the cycle of a couple’s sexual life does not imply a denial of sexuality, but rather a couple’s decision to set temporal boundaries to their sexuality. Jewish tradition honors sexual impulses. The Talmud (BT
   <i>
    Yoma
   </i>
   69b) tells us that without passion the world would cease to exist. However, sexuality, like water, must be channeled in order for life to flourish fully. Passion is exhilarating, but it is not a permanent condition. Moreover, it may gain in intensity when limits are set, as is true with music—where the silent notes underscore the melody. So it goes with sexuality: the downtime (which could be confined to menstruation in the case of women), punctuated by the
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   utilized by both partners, is a form of suspension—a Sabbath—of sexuality. It can leave the space necessary to discover a different face of the other, in a more disciplined tension.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   In
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis 1

   , God creates the world by separating the waters and then withdrawing them to make space for earth and life to appear. The Akkadian root
   <i>
    ku’û
   </i>
   (one of the possible antecedents of the Hebrew word
   <i>
    kav)
   </i>
   means “to wait for, to stretch, to underscore the tension of enduring or waiting.” Oscar Wilde said: “In this world there are only two tragedies; one is not getting what one wants, the other is getting it.” Expectation is the romantic framework of love and desire. The

  <div class="tab-enin">
   The
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   likewise reintroduces spirituality into our lives in a habitual manner. The rabbinic sages capture the power of habits in their determination that frequently occurring rituals take precedence over infrequently occurring rituals (BT
   <i>
    Sukkah
   </i>
   54b, 56a;
   <i>
    P’sachim
   </i>
   114a;
   <i>
    M’gillah
   </i>
   29b; and elsewhere). We are called upon not to build life upon the exceptional but rather to renew the ordinary; such is perhaps one of the secrets of one’s being together with another in partnership.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   When one plunges into the
   <i>
    mikveh,
   </i>
   the links with Creation and with our spirituality extend even further. When we remember that we are created in the image of God,
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   becomes a reminder of the infinite within the finite, the immortal within the human, the limitless options offered to humanity. It is not surprising then that the Torah is compared to water in rabbinic literature. To immerse in water is also to plunge into the “Universe of the Torah,” the infinite source of transformation of the world.
