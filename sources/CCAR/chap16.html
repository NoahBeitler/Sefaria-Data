   (“when [Pharaoh] let [the people] go”) recounts the crossing of the sea, the culmination of the story of the Israelite sojourn in Egypt. From the beginning of the book of Exodus, the goal of leaving Egypt is part of the narrative thread describing the oppressive measures that Pharaoh uses to keep the Israelites in Egypt. That goal is finally realized once the Israelites traverse the Sea of Reeds. This climactic event is related in two versions: a prose account in
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_14.1-31">
    14:1–31
   </a>
   , followed by a poetic account (called in rabbinic literature
   <i>
    Shirat HaYam
   </i>
   , “Song at the Sea”) in
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.1-21">
    15:1–22
   </a>
   . The latter is more of a celebratory or victory hymn than a record of the Exodus event. Without the prose version, the sequence and details of the crossing would be unclear. However, without the poetic one—which may be a female composition—the soaring emotion of escape and the realization of God’s role in deliverance would be lost.

  <div class="tab-en1">
   Fleeing from Egypt does not end the Israelites’ woes. They are far from the Promised Land, and they must cross the uninviting Sinai Peninsula. The crises they face in the wilderness—military threats and shortages of food and water—are the focus of
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.22-17.16">
    15:22
   </a>
   –
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e17-16">
    17:16
   </a>
   . These predicaments foreshadow the challenges they must deal with as an agrarian people living in the highlands of the land of Israel.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Just as women and water began the story of the liberation from Egypt (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.1-22">
    Exodus 2
   </a>
   ), so too they bring it to its fulfillment. Miriam, the sister who first stood by the water (the Nile River) to watch over her baby brother, now, as a prophet, leads the women in interpreting what crossing the water (the Sea of Reeds) means. Thus, women and water frame the story of Israel’s beginnings, from servitude to freedom.

   This phrase refers to the coastal route from Egypt to Israel. The route derives its name from the Philistines, who settled the southern coast of Canaan in the early 12th century

   This designates a more circuitous and difficult route. “Sea of Reeds” (or “Reed Sea”) is a literal translation of
   <i>
    yam suf
   </i>
   and almost certainly does not refer to the Red Sea. It is a descriptive term for a body of water with an abundance of reedy plants rather than the designation of a specific sea. Attempts to identify the sea have proved fruitless, for this is an impressionistic recollection of escape rather than an accurate accounting of geographic places.

The symbolic number twelve suggests a set number of places and thus a purposeful journey rather than a period of random wandering. Most of the places mentioned in the account of the wilderness journey have not been firmly identified—nor is it likely that they ever will be, for the names have been gathered from various sources, or even invented by the storyteller, to give a sense of reality to the dimly remembered recollections of the journey.

   Similar to signals that caravans use, these pillars represent God’s presence. This imagery will recur in the account of the Tabernacle (

   Having reached Etham, the Israelites are told to backtrack so that the pharaoh will think they are lost, thus setting the stage for one last appearance of the motif of the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart.

   The Heb. root is

   The people’s three questions elicit three reassuring imperatives. The language here is used in military contexts to calm troops before battle and to denote battle readiness (see

   </a>
   Moses’ resolute and reassuring response introduces the “divine warrior” theme. Drawn from Canaanite mythology, the image of God doing battle with Israel’s foes is a powerful expression of divine might and one of the most masculine biblical metaphors applied to God (see at
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#ex15-3">
    15:3
   </a>
   ). Military language suffuses the depiction of God’s involvement in delivering the people.

   SPLITTING OF THE SEA (14:15–25)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The sea event takes the narrative to a new level. The signs and wonders performed in Egypt are intense versions of natural devastation, and the horrific slaying of the first-born is a counterpoint to the earlier Egyptian infanticide and an etiology for various Israelite rituals. But the splitting of the sea lies in the realm of cosmic battle.

   The narrator has not previously mentioned this divine messenger (compare

   Taken literally, the complete annihilation of the Egyptian army seems excessive and tragic. However, the story is more likely a literary way to emphasize divine might and God’s concern for the oppressed. Realizing that it is not a historical record of the complete slaughter of many thousands of Egyptians partially ameliorates our modern revulsion at so many deaths. Yet we still must confront the reality of a tradition that recounts and even celebrates this extensive loss of human lives. (See the
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_11.1-12.28">
    introduction to 11:1–10

   ost scholars understand the poetic celebration of Israel’s miraculous rescue from the Egyptians to be a very ancient poem, dating to the late 12th or early 11th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   —much older than the somewhat different prose account that precedes it. In form and content, the poetry draws from the mythological epics of ancient Canaan, in which the heroic deity Baal conquers the primordial forces of chaos, represented by surging waters, so that order can be established. The military imagery of that cosmic battle is echoed and historicized in the Song at the Sea
   <i>
    (Shirat HaYam),
   </i>
   in which the natural elements—water and wind—become God’s weapons against human enemies. The miracle of deliverance is captured in exuberant language, making this passage the thematic centerpiece of Exodus.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Thus far the narrative movement of the book has taken us toward God’s holy mountain, first mentioned in
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E3-6">
    3:1
   </a>
   and now again at the end of this poem (see also
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e3-12">
    3:12
   </a>
   and
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e4-29">
    4:27
   </a>
   ); most of the rest of Exodus focuses on God’s revelation at this mountain. On its location, see at
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_18.1-27">
    18:5
   </a>
   .
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The poetic account of victory at the sea appears in two segments, a longer version (vv. 1–18, with a prose frame in vv. 1 and 19) followed by a much briefer version (v. 21, with a prose introduction in v. 20). On biblical poetry, see at
   <a href="56_chapter_53.xhtml#deu_32.1-43">
    Deuteronomy 32:1–43
   </a>

  <div class="head2" id="exo_vv.1-19">
   SONG AT THE SEA (15:1–19)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Many modern scholars conclude that the Song was created and performed by women. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a considerable body of literary, historical, sociological, and musicological evidence has been amassed to suggest that the Song should be attributed to Miriam. For example, one ancient manuscript tradition calls it the Song of Miriam. Also, songs of military triumph belong to a victory song genre typically composed and performed by women—not men—to greet victorious troops after battle (see at
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    15:20
   </a>
   ). Thus, the title “Song of Miriam” that is often used by modern scholars and interpreters for v. 21 might in fact be appropriate for this passage as well.

    </b>
   </i>
   The prose introduction mentions Moses, the chief human protagonist of the Exodus narrative, as the performer of the Song, along with the people. Hence it has traditionally been assumed that Moses is the author of the Song. Why would a woman’s composition (see previous comment) be attributed to a man? Perhaps the centrality of Moses to the Exodus story meant that authorship of this hymnic masterpiece accrued to him.

   This term may allude to the building of an abode (shrine) for God, a project to which much of the second half of Exodus is devoted. However, because the poetry places it in parallel with “exalt,” the Hebrew term might better be translated “glorify.”

   ,
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e13-14">

      the Warrior.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   As one of the most strikingly male metaphors applied to God in the Bible, this term signifies divine power and asserts that human military victories must be attributed to God. It contributes to our contemporary notion that the biblical deity is male. However, although warriors were understood to be male, this imagery does not mean that the Torah’s composer(s) believed God to be a male being. Note that female imagery for God also occasionally appears in the Bible, including in Exodus (see at
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-4">
    16:4
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">

   ,
   <a href="56_chapter_53.xhtml#deu32-18">
    18
   </a>
   ). In Isaiah 42:13–14, the image of God as a warrior is juxtaposed with the image of God as a woman in labor. The prophet uses both metaphors to convince the people of God’s power.

   An incentive for battle is often the booty gathered by the victors. This phrase probably implies the taking of humans as well as goods, since conquering soldiers took nubile women as spoil (see Judges 5:30). Young female captives were especially prized for their reproductive and labor potential, for the mortality rates for women due to death in childbirth meant a shortage of wives. (See at

   </i>
   The very declaration of uniqueness is witness to a polytheistic world: God is unique among the “celestials,” a somewhat misleading translation of a word that means “gods.” Because true monotheism did not emerge in ancient Israel until the 6th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.

   </i>
   Although some understand this to be a reference to the Jerusalem temple and thus consider the Song a composition of the monarchic period (beginning in the 10th century), the mythic nature of the hymn makes it more likely that “holy abode” refers to God’s heavenly habitation. The Israelites, like their Canaanite neighbors, imagined a divine abode in heaven that became the model for God’s earthly dwellings, the Tabernacle and the Temple (see at v. 17 and
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">

   These four groups of people represent the Israelites’ early enemies. The Song serves as a warning to them, anticipating or reflecting Israel’s early struggles in the Promised Land.

   A better translation would be “created.” The root
   <i>
    k-n-h
   </i>
   can mean “to acquire” (hence “ransomed”; compare “redeemed” in v. 13) or “to create.” It was used when Eve, the archetypal mother, gave birth to her first child (
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_4.1-6.8">
    Genesis 4:1

   ), the woman mentioned in more biblical books (five) than any other female figure finally gets a name. She also gets a title, one that never appears for Moses in the book of Exodus. Miriam is the first of several biblical women—including Deborah (Judges 4:4), Huldah (II Kings 22:14), and Noadiah (Nehemiah 6:14)—to bear the title of prophet. The authority of prophets as conveyors of God’s will to the people was gender inclusive both in the biblical world and in other parts of the ancient Near East. The 8th-century-

    B.C.E.
   </small>
   prophet Micah acknowledges Miriam’s leading role in the Exodus when he proclaims in God’s name that to deliver Israel, “I sent you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam” (Micah 6:4). In the present verse, Miriam appears also as a singer and a leader of other singing women, a role familiar from other biblical texts and ancient cultures.

   This translation of

   </i>
   is more appropriate than either the anachronistic “tambourine” or the vague “timbrel” that appears in many English translations; tambourines are not attested until the Roman period, more than a thousand years later. The hand-drum, or frame-drum, is the only percussion instrument mentioned in the Bible, in contrast to other classes of instruments (such as string and wind instruments) for which there are many examples. Archeological evidence—such as terracotta statuettes of women (never men) playing the frame-drum—indicates that this was largely a woman’s instrument. Thus, the mention of instrumental ensembles, including the frame-drum in other biblical texts (such as Psalm 150), suggests the presence of female musicians. Because of the rhythmic nature of ancient Hebrew music, drum playing —by women—would have been an essential part of most musical performances.

   </i>
   It was apparently customary in ancient Israel for women to welcome victorious armies with victory songs (see Judges 11:34; I Samuel 18:6–7). Accomplished female musicians would have earned the esteem of their community. Also, groups of female performers likely would have met together to practice their instruments and compose songs for specific occasions, which would have provided occasions for female bonding and for women to exert organizational skills and mentor younger performers.

   Along with singing and drum playing, dance was an integral part of this performance genre. It is likely that most musical performances in the biblical world involved movement as well as vocal and instrumental expression (see Psalms 149:3; 150:4).

   o sooner do the Israelites safely cross the sea than they are confronted with two universal problems of community survival. The first concerns sustenance: how will they secure enough to eat and drink? The second concerns safety: how will they deal with military threats? The provision of food and water and the protection from enemies signal God’s beneficent presence. The deliverance from Egypt was depicted largely in masculine imagery—with God portrayed, for example, as a warrior defeating Israel’s enemies. Now we come to accounts of divine resolution of food and water problems; arguably these episodes portray God with female imagery, insofar as women in ancient Israel were the ones who frequently drew water (see
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-12">
    Genesis 24:11
   </a>
   and
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E2-16">
    Exodus 2:16
   </a>
   ) and nearly always provided food.

   The trust in God and Moses established by the sea episode (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e14-31">

   Like other places named in this parashah, this is an unknown locale and probably not a real place. Instead, its name, meaning “bitterness,” indicates what happens there. In addition, the name connects the bitterness of wandering with the bitterness of work in Egypt (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e1-14">
    1:14
   </a>
   ), which the bitter herbs of the Passover ritual commemorate (

   What might nowadays be considered magic and thus superstition was believed to be efficacious in the biblical world.

   Cereal products were so central to the diet of people in ancient Israel—providing approximately half of their daily caloric in take—that the Bible uses the term for bread (
   <i>
    lechem
   </i>
   ) sometimes to denote food more generally. Close examination of biblical texts mentioning bread production, and consideration of relevant archeological and ethnographic data, together indicate that women were the producers of bread in households in the Land of Israel. In an arduous series of operations—grinding, sifting, kneading, baking (which involved collecting wood and building fires)—taking several hours every day, women transformed grain into bread. This complex process was essential because human beings cannot digest the endosperm surrounding the grain nor the grains’ nutritional starch in raw form. On women and bread-baking, see also at
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e11-6">

    Y BREAKING THROUGH
   </small>
   the waters of the Sea of Reeds and emerging through the narrow passage, Israel is born as a liberated nation. Like any newborn, Israel expresses the need for food and water—and voices the fear of their absence. In response, God behaves as a mother, sometimes nurturing, sometimes stern, often setting limits.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Israel first faces a lack of water. When they encounter bitter waters, Moses sweetens them by casting in a piece of wood. Later, panic ensues because no springs are discovered at Rephidim. God instructs Moses to bring forth water from a rock with the very staff that turned the Nile to blood. On this initial leg of the journey, the people interpret the lack of water and food as indicative of God’s absence, much as an infant interprets a lack of nourishment as the absence of nurture.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Food can be called Israel’s national obsession, and it is used to gauge the relative safety or danger of a situation. Raw foods that require less chewing (milk, honey, manna) indicate relative stability, while meat has the potential to cause trouble (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_11.1-12.16">
    Numbers 11
   </a>
   ). Although no mention is made of Israel eating anything in Egypt before the Passover celebration (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-2">
    Exodus 12:8–9
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e12-14">
    15
   </a>
   ), the people salivate when remembering Egyptian delicacies (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-1">
    Exodus 16:3
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#n11-5">
    Numbers 11:5
   </a>
   ). While God promises Israel a land of milk and honey, they accuse God of trying to starve them in the wilderness (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-1">
    Exodus 16:3
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num21-4">
    Numbers 21:5
   </a>
   ). God rains bread from heaven (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-4">
    Exodus 16:4
   </a>
   ) as a taste of what is to come: manna that is white as milk and resembles the promised honey (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-31">
    Exodus 16:31
   </a>
   ). But, as Moses later informs the Divine, not even manna can fill the bottomless pit of Israel’s appetite (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#n11-21">
    Numbers 11:21–22

   Why are the people so hungry? Perhaps the trauma of slavery has left a residue of deprivation, or perhaps meals allow for some regularity during the journey through an unknown wilderness. The plot of the Torah implies that the people can find satisfaction only when they partake of the homeland’s fruits (Joshua 5:11–12). Hunger is indicative of exile; and Israel is not sated until it finds a home.

   </i>
   (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.1-21">
    15:1
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis noted that the word
   <i>
    shirah
   </i>
   (song) appears ten times in the Hebrew Scriptures. The Song at the Sea (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.1-21">
    Exodus 15
   </a>
   ) is the second instance. According to
   <i>
    M’chilta,
   </i>
   an early commentary on Exodus, nine of these songs were sung in the past, but the tenth is for the “Age to Come.” This passage also reports that “for all the songs referring to previous events the noun used (
   <i>
    shirah)
   </i>
   is in the feminine” (
   <i>
    Shirta
   </i>
   1). In a revelatory exposition of rabbinic sexual politics, the sages explained that “even as a female gives birth, so the achievements of the past were followed by subjugation.” That is, just as a woman who emerges from a successful labor is still subject to the authority of her husband, so Israel, despite small victories, has consistently been subjected to foreign conquest. However, in the case of the future song, predicted in “Sing unto
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   <a id="page_401">
   </a>
   a new song” (Isaiah 42:10), the masculine noun
   <i>
    shir
   </i>
   is used. This indicates “that just as no male gives birth, so the triumph which is yet to come will not be succeeded by subjugation” (

   ). Miriam is called “the prophet” in this verse, although she never prophesies in the Bible. The
   <i>
    M’chilta

   says she predicted the birth of Moses to her father, who praised her when Moses was born—but then blamed her when they were forced to expose him in the basket (S
   <i>

   <i>

   </i>
   (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    15:20
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis speculated as to where the women obtained the musical instruments they played when they danced at the sea. Like a mother who remembers to pack all the necessities for a family trip, the women’s confidence that God would deliver them made them bring these instruments along: “But where did the Israelites get hand-drums and flutes in the wilderness? It was simply that the righteous were confident and knew that God would perform miracles and mighty deeds when they left Egypt, so they prepared hand-drums and flutes” (
   <i>
    M’chilta, Shirta
   </i>
   10). Although the
   <i>
    M’chilta
   </i>
   calls the righteous
   <i>
    tzaddikim
   </i>
   (masculine plural), the medieval commentator Rashi, in his remarks on this verse, made a point of calling them
   <i>

   (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    15:21
   </a>
   ). Interpreters visualized two choral groups at the sea chanting the same song, both led by prophets: the men by Moses, the women by Miriam. Just as Moses recited the Song among the men, so it was Miriam who recited among the women: “Sing to
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   for He has triumphed gloriously” (
   <i>
    M’chilta, Shirta

  <div class="tab-en1">
   In rabbinic literature, Miriam and Moses often appear in parallel, with Miriam given an equal status to Moses. In a midrash in the 13th-century-
   <small>
    C.E.
   </small>
   <i>
    Midrash HaGadol,
   </i>
   Joseph explains two dreams of Pharaoh in which the number three appears. According to Joseph’s interpretation, the double appearance of this number refers to the three patriarchs and to the three leaders who would redeem the people from Egypt: Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. Furthermore, the miraculous well of Miriam, which accompanied the people of Israel though the wilderness and sustained them because of Miriam’s righteousness (BT
   <i>
    Taanit
   </i>
   9a;
   <i>
    B’midbar Rabbah
   </i>
   1.2), was among the ten miraculous entities created by God during the twilight on the eve of the first Sabbath (Mishnah
   <i>
    Avot
   </i>
   5:6). This well complements the manna, which was given to the people because of Moses’ righteousness. The Talmud (BT
   <i>
    Taanit
   </i>
   9a, among many other sources) explains as follows: “Rabbi Yose the son of Rabbi Judah says, ‘Three good leaders had arisen for Israel—namely, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam—and for their sake three good things were given: the well, the clouds of glory, and the manna. The first was given for the merits of Miriam, the second for those of Aaron, and the third for those of Moses.’” The well disappeared at Miriam’s death, but one tradition says a vessel of water from Miriam’s well is one of three concealed objects that Elijah will restore in the messianic age, along with vessels of manna and of sacred oil (
   <i>
    M’chilta, Vayassa

    HERE ARE MOMENTS

   that define us: unexpected or unplanned moments when the decisions we make, the actions we take, determine all that will follow. Crossroads come disguised in many forms. Many are unmarked, without a hint of what is ahead.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   <i>
    B’shalach
   </i>
   describes such a crossroads. The crossing of the Sea of Reeds was not only the crossing out of Egypt and out of slavery, but also the entrance into an unknown future, made possible by a moment of extraordinary faith.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   At the far bank of the sea, triumph rings out in instrumental music and in song, led by both Moses and Miriam. Yet earlier, with Egyptians in pursuit and the waters ahead, according to the Rabbis it was neither Moses nor Miriam who took center stage, but Nahshon ben Amminadab. Nahshon is a curious hero. Briefly mentioned as Aaron’s brother-in-law (
   <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#e6-20">
    Exodus 6:23
   </a>
   ), the Torah neither notices nor lauds him. Yet the Rabbis praise him for his initiative, the one who first entered the billowing waves, leading all of Israel to safety.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Nahshon’s heroism is a literary deduction. In
   <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#n7-12">
    Numbers 7:12
   </a>
   , Nahshon, the prince of the tribe of Judah, brings the first offering to dedicate the Tabernacle. The Midrash surmises: “When it was time to dedicate the tabernacle, Moses confessed to the princes of the tribes, ‘The Holy One has commanded you to bring offerings, but I do not know who should go first.’ The princes looked at Nahshon, saying, ‘This man has sanctified the name of the Holy One at the Sea of Reeds. He is worthy to bring the
   <i>
    Shechinah.
   </i>
   Let Nahshon go first’” (
   <i>
    B’midbar Rabbah
   </i>
   12.21).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   At the Sea of Reeds, according to midrashic tradition, Nahshon stood at a crossroads—whether to have faith and plunge into the water, or be gripped by fear and remain on the shore. What was that moment like? If we were on the shore of the sea that fateful day, how would we have acted? Confidently? Timidly? Would we have entered the water gingerly or with fury? Flailing or swimming? How do we approach the sea crossings in our own lives? Are we coerced by an army from behind, or pulled ahead by the unknown?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Some think of Nahshon as fearless, determined to be the first into the water. In
   <i>
    Midrash T’hillim
   </i>
   114:8, Nahshon reputedly pelts his brothers with stones to assure his place of primacy. The daredevil confidence of this Nahshon contrasts sharply with another vision of this moment (
   <i>
    M’chilta, B’shalach
   </i>
   5). Huddled together, a terrified crowd looks behind at the Egyptians and forward toward water. As they yell, “I don’t want to go into the sea!” Nahshon jumps up in fear; losing his footing, he falls into the waves. Overcome with terror, he cites Psalms, “Save me, O God, for the waters have reached my neck” (Psalm 69:2). Here, Nahshon—a fearful, drowning man—cries for God’s help. The midrash alternately envisions Nahshon as hapless victim, brash show-off, or eager leader.

   As she emerges from the water, Miriam, too, faces an array of alternatives—an internal sea crossing of her own. Was it the time to forge ahead, adrenaline still coursing from their narrow escape? Was it the occasion to mourn the loss of the known, the familiar if oppressive Egypt? Was it the instant to comfort those catching their breath, those who had needed to run and swim faster than they believed possible? Was it safer to hang back and let others take their rightful place as leaders? Or was this the moment to lift up the hand-drum and triumphantly sing and dance, giddy with gratitude for God’s redemption?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Miriam had the foresight to bring her hand-drum. Miriam
   <a id="page_403">

   had the wisdom to gather her sisters to acknowledge and affirm the miracle, to mark the moment when their tenuous hope broke forth in joy— the birth of her community as a people touched by God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Like Nahshon, Miriam’s leadership is surprising.
   <i>
    Kol ishah,
   </i>
   the voice of a woman, Miriam’s strong voice, had been heard previously only as a sister and daughter. Yet, at her sea crossing, emerging from the waters, she does not wait for someone else to change the world. She does not demur that she was not bred for greatness. She does not blend into the crowd. Instead, Miriam’s voice rings out for all to hear.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Miriam is a leader: a prophet who speaks to and binds others to God. Like a large
   <i>
    tallit
   </i>
   on small shoulders, she is one upon whom the mantle of authority does not fit snugly, one who might have been surprised at her own influence, but one who nevertheless conscientiously undertakes responsibility for contributing to God’s purpose—much like contemporary women leaders. In the waters of transition, Miriam sparks innovation, creativity, and hope, rooted in the past yet focused on the future—just like contemporary women leaders. Like Nahshon before the waves and Miriam after them, we ask: how do we navigate waters never traversed before? How do we create rituals that reflect the tradition yet give voice to our experience? How do we speak new words that include the familiar in a Holy tongue?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Like Nahshon and Miriam, today’s women face our own sea crossing. We too can choose to enter the water: with quiet certitude, brash impulsiveness, or terror at what lies ahead. Or, we may decide to hang back, looking around for someone else to go in first. Eventually, when we enter—however we enter—we, and our world, are transformed.

   In our time, the sea crossing may be when we hear a cry for social justice, when we unexpectedly find our voice waxing prophetic; it may come as we read a book, converse with a friend, or witness a scene in which we are seized with understanding about our place in the world. As we enter the water, if we speak and act out of awe and gratitude, if we look around and trust our vision, we may discover that we are bathed in and buoyed by the presence of God.
