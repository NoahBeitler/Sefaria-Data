   (“eighth,” referring to the eighth day of ordination) describes the ritual on the day after Aaron’s ordination ceremony. In the previous two parashot,
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    Leviticus 1–7
   </a>
   presented rules for the sacrificial service, while
   <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_8.1-36">
    Leviticus 8
   </a>
   described the priestly ordination of Aaron and his sons. In this parashah, Aaron begins to officiate as chief priest.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This parashah includes a strange story of the fire from God which kills Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s oldest sons (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.1-7">
    10:1–7
   </a>
   ). It concludes with dietary laws and with the demand that Israel be holy—for God is holy (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#L11-45">
    11:45
   </a>
   ). In this parashah, the theme of holiness expands from the sanctuary to the priests and to the people.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Contemporary readers are often troubled by the descriptions of the sacrificial service. Nevertheless, sacrifice was an integral part of society in the ancient Near East. Every major city in antiquity had its temple where specially ordained priests conducted animal sacrifices. As elsewhere in antiquity, Leviticus also demands that no one can eat meat unless a portion of it is offered first as a sacrifice to God. The sacrificial altar is God’s dining table.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This parashah says practically nothing about women. Many temples in the ancient world included women as priests, but ancient Israel seems to have recognized only males in this role (see
   <i>
    T’tzaveh
   </i>
   ,
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#page_489">
    Another View
   </a>
   ; and at
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_9.1-24">
    9:1
   </a>
   ). Although the priestly laws in the Bible mostly concern men, priests’ daughters—and presumably wives—were able to partake of some of the offerings, as
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#L10-14">
    10:14
   </a>
   indicates (see also
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#L22-10">
    22:12–13
   </a>
   ).

   Of special relevance to women are the dietary laws in Leviticus. These apply to all Israelites. However, because women were responsible for food preparation, they were responsible for applying these laws (see at
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_11.1-47">
    Leviticus 11

   he parashah begins on the eighth day (hence its name), the day after the seven-day ordination ceremony of the priests. Aaron now begins his priestly duties and the Tabernacle’s activities commence. The first part of Leviticus provided the rules for the sacrificial system, but only now that the priests have been ordained can the worship itself be inaugurated.

   Aaron’s sons begin now to function as priests, and they will lead the congregation upon his death. According to
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#L10-14">
    10:14
   </a>
   , Aaron also has (unnamed) daughters. Do they also participate in running the Tabernacle along with his sons? According to
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_38.1-20">
    Exodus 38:8
   </a>
   , women “perform tasks
   <i>
    (tzovot)
   </i>
   at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.” As noted in the comment there, the verb
   <i>
    tzovot
   </i>
   seems to indicate the work of a support staff. Perhaps that reference to women alludes to, or at least includes, Aaron’s daughters. They might prepare the basins, the knives, the water, and other materials needed for the Tabernacle.

   The inauguration involves four different types of sacrifice: a purgation offering (see
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.1-5.26">
    Leviticus 4

   ); a burnt offering (see
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">

   ); an offering of well-being (see
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">

   ); and a meal offering (see
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    Leviticus 2

   ). Every type of offering is brought except the
   <i>

   </i>
   the reparation offering (see
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#L5-15">
    5:15–26

    The Strange Fire of Nadab and Abihu

   (10:1–7)

   n the tragic story that follows, Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s two oldest sons, offer a ritual fire that God did not command. As a result, fire comes from God and kills them. Like good tragedy everywhere, the story is intended to elicit pity and fear—pity for Nadab, Abihu, their father, mother, and siblings; and fear that God’s terrifying power may burst forth again. The world is perceived as a dangerous place, and God can protect but also create harm (Isaiah 45:7). The ancient world’s protection is the sacrificial ritual correctly performed according to the prescribed rules. However, contact with the holy must be rigorously safeguarded from illegitimate incursion. If the procedures are performed incorrectly, the sanctuary becomes defiled, with disastrous consequences (
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#L15-31">
    15:31
   </a>
   ). This story, however, leaves the reader uncertain as to what precisely constitutes the sons’ transgression.

   The verse implies that the offering might have been fine if it had been ordered by a proper authority. This episode underscores what everyone in the ancient Near East apparently believed: the deity must be worshipped precisely as specified or catastrophe occurs.

    </b>
   </a>
   The exact reasons for this punishment are unclear. The Bible records another story where God destroys a person for touching the ark in an unauthorized manner: King David decides to bring the ark of God to Jerusalem. En route the ark begins to slip off the ox-cart. Unbidden, a man reaches out his hand to steady the ark and God kills him (II Samuel 6:6–7). Both that story and the present one illustrate the danger ascribed to the holy. Indeed, ritual aims to contain and protect against the danger inherent in the holy.

    </b>
   </i>
   Or, “I sanctify myself by means of those near to me.” That is, I reveal my holiness among those near to me. The ones “nearest” to God were Nadab and Abihu: when they offered the incense they literally “came near” (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.1-7">
    10:1
   </a>
   ; see
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_16.1-34">
    16:1
   </a>
   ); and as priests, they are “nearer” to God than non-priests. These deaths evince God’s power as awesome and the Tabernacle’s status as holy. According to this reading, then, God uses the deaths of Nadab and Abihu to magnify Godself. The story of Nadab and Abihu may aim, among other things, to illustrate that priestly privilege may not be abused.

   There is not much that one can say when confronted with the awesome power of God. But what was the reaction of Nadab and Abihu’s mother, Elisheba (see

   The anointing oil is holy and must be used in the manner prescribed, that is, by the high priest when he conducts the sacrificial rites (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_30.11-31.18">
    Exodus 30:30–33
   </a>
   ). If Aaron is outside the tent or in the presence of the dead, he defiles the oil and also the sanctuary (
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.14">
    21:10–12
   </a>
   ). If the sanctuary becomes defiled, the entire community could perish (
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#L15-31">
    15:31
   </a>
   ). An ordinary priest may defile himself through burial of his son and other members of his immediate family (
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
    Leviticus 21:1
   </a>

    Laws for Aaron The Priest and His Household

   he Tent of Meeting must be purged of the contamination of the corpse defilement that occurred with the deaths of Nadab and Abihu, but that report appears only later, in
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_16.1-34">
    Leviticus 16
   </a>
   . Here, following additional instructions to the priests (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.8-20">
    vv. 8–15
   </a>
   ), comes an odd story about the purgation offering. Moses suddenly chastises Aaron and his remaining sons for erroneously burning the goat rather than eating it (see
   <a href="#levi_9.1-24">
    9:1–4
   </a>
   for relevant laws). Aaron obliquely asks: if they had eaten it, would his sons have been spared? Moses has no answer.

   The mention of wine and strong drink here leads some to suggest that the placement of this verse implies that strong drink caused Nadab and Abihu to act precipitously. More likely, however, this placement is coincidental.

   Citing Aaron’s sons specifically by name may indicate that only the chief priest and his male heirs are entitled to the “most holy” offerings—daughters being excluded. As indicated by v. 14 (compare
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#L23-20">
    23:20
   </a>
   ) and by
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#L22-10">
    22:12–13
   </a>
   , a priest’s daughter may eat “holy” food, if not the “most holy,” so long as she is part of her father’s household. (See further at

   Designated parts of the meal and gift offering may be eaten by women as well as by anyone belonging to the priest’s household (

   Here, as in v. 13, the word
   <i>

   does not include daughters. These donations primarily compensate the (male) priests for their ritual role; only secondarily do they serve to feed members of the family who are not serving as priests.

   Moses’ anger regarding the sacrifice of the goat is puzzling. Was he not there when they burned it? Moses chastises Aaron and his remaining sons for further lack of scrupulousness in carrying out their responsibilities, but perhaps he is passing off his own derelication of duties onto them.

   Moses’ point is that a purgation offering is not complete until the priests have eaten their share of the meat from it. The law requires that it be eaten in a pure place (“in the sacred precinct,”
   <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#L6-18">
    6:19
   </a>
   ).

      have approved?”
     </b>
    </i>
   </a>
   Aaron’s rhetorical question implies that God would not have approved. Aaron apparently has reasoned that the death of Nadab and Abihu has polluted the area (compare
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_19.1-22">
    Numbers 19:14
   </a>
   )—and yet Aaron and his sons cannot leave the vicinity (above, v. 7). Thus the priests have no place available where they can eat the meat.

    Dietary Laws for The Israelite people

   t this point in the narrative, the Israelites have set up the Tabernacle (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_40.1-38">
    Exodus 40
   </a>
   ), received specifications for the sacrifices (
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    Leviticus 1–7
   </a>
   ), ordained the priesthood (
   <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_8.1-36">
    Leviticus 8
   </a>
   ), and initiated formal worship (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_9.1-24">
    Leviticus 9–10
   </a>
   ). God has assigned the priests their task of teaching Israel to distinguish between the ritually pure and the impure (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#L10-10">
    10:10–11
   </a>
   ). This task includes being able to differentiate between pure and impure foods, to which the text now turns. The people must make such distinctions in their daily, household life, not merely in relation to the sanctuary. The practice of differentiating between the pure and the impure in one’s eating creates a relationship between the priests’ work in the sanctuary and ordinary Israelites at home.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   No explanation is offered for what makes these items unfit as food, and none is needed. These specific food prohibitions likely reflect ancient cultural dislikes (“taboos” is too strong a word) that eventually become solidified into law (see also at
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu_12.1-16.17">
    Deuteronomy 14:3–21
   </a>
   ). They later become explicit indicators of identity, however. That is, loyalty to one’s Judaism and to Judaism’s God came to be expressed via resistance to violating the dietary laws. For example, according to II Maccabees 7, a mother instructs her sons to die rather than eat pork publicly. [Some food prohibitions may also have had functional economic reasons behind them (such as an attempt to avoid economic dependence on other groups). Others may have been symbolic, such as avoiding predatory animals (possibly with a rationale that “you are what you eat”). —

   This unit has special relevance for women. The ancient Israelite diet consisted mostly of grains—supplemented with milk curds, cheese, yogurt, wine, olive oil, legumes, and fruits and vegetables. In ancient Israel preparing those foodstuffs was the domain of women; it was they who typically supervised or performed tasks such as building the fire, drawing water from the well, grinding the grain, kneading the dough, forming the cakes, milking the sheep and goats, making the cheese and yogurt, gathering the olives and dates, and treading the grapes. As a result, we can assume that women were responsible for maintaining the dietary laws.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Meat was reserved for special occasions. Scholars debate the role of women in slaughtering animals for meat in ancient Israel. Some suggest, on the basis of ancient reliefs, that during certain periods, animals were slaughtered domestically. In those periods, women may have participated in the task. (In 1 Samuel 28:24, the woman of En-dor slaughters a calf on her own initiative and prepares a meal with it.) However, other evidence suggests that women did not slaughter animals. If slaughtering was restricted to the sanctuary—even a local sanctuary—it would have been unlikely that women would perform the actual sacrifice. If women went at all, they would have been accompanied by a man who would have performed the sacrifice rite. (For a different opinion, see at
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    1:5
   </a>
   .).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   It has been suggested that women also controlled food distribution in the household. However, it is perhaps more likely that the customs in present-day traditional Arabic and Afghani societies are relevant in this regard. In these societies women do prepare the food, but the men and boys get the lion’s share; the women and girls wait in the back room until the men are done eating. The food is not allocated, but simply laid on the floor on platters in front of the men and boys, who eat with their hands from the common pot until they are done. Then the women eat. These customs go back into antiquity; they may also reflect the customs of ancient Israel. (A similar picture may be implicit in
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 18
   </a>
   .) [It is also possible that the overall role of women in Islamic cultures today is significantly different from that of ancient Israel and thus may not provide a reliable analogy. Some ethnographic evidence indicates that in ancient Palestine the whole family ordinarily ate together, gathered around common dishes. —

   Pigs were raised in Syria and the Levant in antiquity prior to the advent of the Israelite presence in the Judean highlands. Iron Age Israelite settlements show only very few pig bones, in contrast to earlier settlements there, and in contrast to neighboring areas (of the Philistines, Moabites, and Ammonites) where pig bones are well attested during the same time period. It is thus likely that the prohibition against eating pig among the Israelites is very ancient.

   </i>
   Anthropologist Mary Douglas suggests that the prohibition of touching the carcass of the inedible mammals protects these animals in their lifetime. Since they cannot be skinned, dismembered, or exploited after death, they need not be hunted or killed. Thus elephants would not be killed for their tusks, alligators for their hides, mink or ermine for their fur, nor turtles for their shells. However, the Rabbis may be right in interpreting this prohibition as applying only to priests serving in the sanctuary (
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#L22-8">
    22:8
   </a>
   ) and not to the laity. The prohibition has meaning only for members of a priestly household: One who touches such a carcass is ritually impure. In order to eat of the sacred donations, he or she must bathe and remain impure until evening. (See further at

   A cistern was usually cut into bedrock and used for collecting and storing runoff. It was kept covered with a stone when not in use. If the rock was porous, the cistern was waterproofed by being plastered with lime.

   the notion of a rational religion, yet we still seek a logical basis for the food laws in
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_11.1-47">
    Leviticus 11
   </a>
   . Mary Douglas, who examines the food prohibitions in Leviticus from an anthropological perspective, looks for the underlying rationale. In her influential work
   <i>
    Purity and Danger
   </i>
   (1966), she concludes that the distinctions between pure and impure animals are based on the principle that pure animals are those that stay well within the bounds of their habitat. The qualities of impure animals are seen as unsuitable for their habitat, thereby threatening to blur the boundaries established by pure animals, who possess qualities seen as suitable for that habitat. Douglas’s categories rely largely on the means of locomotion appropriate to each sphere: wings for air, cleft hooves for earth, fins and scales for water. Everything that blurs these boundaries is segregated and put into a category of defilement.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Less well known is a brilliant and complex later essay, “Self Evidence” (in her book
   <i>
    Implicit Meanings,
   </i>
   1975), in which Douglas suggests how biblical food prohibitions fit into the wider historical and sociological realities of the Israelites and later of the Jews, throughout their history. This preoccupation with distinguishing what is inside bounds from what is outside bounds is a reflection, according to Douglas, of Israelite history and sociology. Inside Israel’s frail boundaries is a small political unit surrounded by powerful enemies. Douglas concludes that here is a people who cherish their boundaries and want nothing better than to keep them strong and high; any attempt to cross them is seen as a hostile intrusion.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The mysteries of the parashah and the rational connection between religion and culture come together here. For biblical Israel, being holy means being set apart. Food prohibitions reflect Israel’s preoccupation with clearly defined categories. This preoccupation continues to be expressed when Jews differentiate between the holy and profane, between light and darkness, between Israel and other nations, between Shabbat and the rest of the week. What Douglas illustrates, in both her earlier and later works, is how such religious practices and systems are shaped by sociopolitical circumstances, and, in turn, shape the norms of the community.

   The Rabbis inherited from the Torah a ritual purity system that had involved both priests and laity, and both women and men; those sages assumed that the biblical commandments for ritual purification required full immersion in a
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   (plural,
   <i>
    mikva’ot).
   </i>
   In biblical times, however, ritual washing could have been achieved instead by splashing, pouring (affusion), or rinsing. The range of available strategies is illustrated in Greek red- and black-figure pottery from the 6th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   onward, where scenes depict men or women showering from spigots in a slightly stooped but standing position, using tubs and basins, or having water from large jugs poured upon them while in a crouched position. Neighboring Near Eastern cultures also had a variety of forms of purification, and there is no reason to think that uniformity was the rule in ancient Israel as well. When rabbinic Judaism eventually emerged as the dominant form of Jewish practice, however, the
   <i>

   would become the only acceptable type of installation for ritual immersion.

   Archeologists have found numerous ritual bathing pools that Jews constructed during the Second Temple period (some two thousand years ago), indicating their practice of full bodily immersion. Since stored rainwater was always a scarce commodity, Jews utilized water diverted from caves, springs, and rivers whenever possible in building ritual baths. The most common use of such
   <i>
    mikva’ot
   </i>
   during this era was purification prior to entering the area of the Temple. Rabbinic sources indicate that the Jewish court
   <i>
    (beit din
   </i>
   ) supervised the construction, validity, measurements, and cleanliness of these
   <i>
    mikva’ot.
   </i>
   During Second Temple times, however, it appears that Jews had not achieved uniformity of opinion as to
   <i>

   must be hewn out of rock or built into the ground; it must also be made watertight, usually with plaster, since any leakage invalidates it. A ritual bath must contain a minimum of forty
   <i>
    se’ahs
   </i>
   (at least two hundred gallons, or more than 750 liters) of free-flowing clean water, sufficient for full immersion either vertically or horizontally. Rain or spring water is valid, as is water diverted from a river, lake, or ocean. Once a

   is vested with considerable power and responsibility. Though everything is new—and no models exist for him to follow—Aaron carries out his role with great competency and dignity as he offers up the first sacrifices to God.

   In
   <i>
    parashat Sh’mini,
   </i>
   we find ourselves with Aaron and his family at an exhilarating moment. It is the climactic eighth day of dedication of the Tabernacle. Exultant and joyful, Aaron and his sons bless the people—and the glory of God appears before all. A fire of heavenly origin consumes the sacrifices in their entirety; the people fall on their faces in awe and love of God. Aaron’s joy must surely be overflowing.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Suddenly, the scene turns into heartbreak. Though not commanded to do so, Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s elder sons, put incense into pans and bring it as an offering. Instantly, a fire of God leaps out and consumes them. Aaron is devastated. These two sons were outstanding young men: they were deemed worthy of ascending Mt. Sinai in a most prestigious order—after Moses and Aaron, and before the 70 elders—and worthy of participating in the festive meal at which God’s face was shown (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_24.1-18">
    Exodus 24:1
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#exo_7.8-9.35">
    9–11
   </a>
   ).

  <div class="tab-enin">
   What could have happened? We struggle to understand. Was this a punishment from God, or a random accident? What crime could they have committed that was so heinous as to warrant death by flash fire? Perhaps they were acting out of enthusiasm and desire to serve. Perhaps they were overcome simply by the pure joy of being in the presence of God—and wished only to increase awe in the hearts of the people. And even if they were guilty of not following God’s word to the last, did not their father Aaron have credit in the storehouse of good deeds? Was there not some milder punishment that could have been meted out on the scale, such as that meted out to other miscreants in the Torah?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Yet despite the fact that they performed everything else properly and created a glorious Tabernacle celebration, despite their father’s merit or their own, they are swiftly cut down.

   When I was growing up, my high school Torah teacher, Mar Yerushalmi, communicated unequivocally to his students that Nadab and Abihu were punished for the grave sin of eating in the place where they should not have. Whenever a student would be caught chewing gum in class as we studied Torah with Rashi’s commentary, Yerushalmi would remind her of Nadab and Abihu. On the one hand, this devout teacher was implying that the sons were guilty and deserved what they got; on the other, likening their crime to a teenager’s act of chewing gum in the wrong setting was his way of subtly suggesting to a class of impressionable teenagers that he, too, felt the punishment did not fit the crime.

   The Torah narrative teaches us that Moses struggles with the same issue, trying to find an explanation. He wants to offer consolation to his beloved brother and closest friend, yet he takes care not to betray his responsibility as the leader who must teach the people to follow God’s law “This is what
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   meant by saying, ‘Through those near to Me I show Myself holy’” (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#L10-3">
    10:3
   </a>
   ). Moses’ delicate message to the people—and his only consolation to Aaron—is that this was not a random act but a sentence decreed on those closest to God, who are thus held to a higher standard. What was Aaron’s response? Two simple words:
   <i>
    vayidom
    <a id="page_633">
    </a>
    Aharon
   </i>
   (“And Aaron was silent”). The word
   <i>
    vayidom
   </i>
   means more than he kept quiet—
   <i>
    vayishtok.
   </i>
   Aaron responded with a profound, shattering silence, a stunning silence, a shocked silence. He does not justify the cruel decree by blaming his sons and accepting their fate as punishment for their sins. Yet, neither does he revolt or protest God’s action. Total silence.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Aaron’s response is the profoundest human and religious response to the reality that there are times when good people die unjustly or are consumed in tragedies that seem to be arbitrary, shocking, without justification, and with nothing to ameliorate the pain and loss of those who love them.

   A few years ago, in 2002, my beloved son JJ, age 36, was killed while riding a bicycle in Israel. He had arrived the night before to celebrate the holidays with the whole family and was bicycling with his brother to visit his sister in Zichron Yaakov, when a young driver ran a yellow light with great speed—and took JJ’s life in an instant. JJ loved Israel, family, Judaism, athletics, God, nature, and life; and he was celebrating all of these loves when his life was snuffed out.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   When my husband and I sat
   <i>
    shiva,
   </i>
   most people came with no forethought agenda or explanation, though a few—out of good intention and compassion—tried to justify God or soften the loss by giving it some meaning. “He was so good that God needed him by His side” was one such attempt, to which on one occasion—unable to hold back my words—I responded, “But we on Earth need him more!” Most people understood at the deepest level that there was nothing that could justify, nothing that could offset the pain or soften the blow, and they wisely remained silent. And we ourselves were silent, as there were no words we could speak that would make any sense of it.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   At times, devout members of religions that affirm an afterlife are tempted to say that the deceased is “in a better place—living a better life in a better world”; or they are tempted to suggest that there must be some sin or error or judgment that has brought this fate upon the victim. Such persons cannot tolerate the thought that what has happened is unjustified, for it violates their deepest principles about good and evil, reward and punishment. They need somehow to internally rationalize and justify a reality in order to bring the world back to proper equilibrium.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Jewish laws of bereavement, so exquisitely tuned to the needs of the mourners, stipulate that the
   <i>
    shiva
   </i>
   visitor should not speak until the mourner speaks. I had always thought that the point of that precept was to ensure that the conversation would flow to the place the mourner needs it to reach. But I now understand that the halachah enjoining the comforting visitor to hold back in silence serves a different function: to caution against offering a rationale for the decree of death. The deeper human religious response is to be silent, to live with the contradiction, and to affirm that we need not force meaning into tragedy. Sometimes, the deepest response of love is to be silent.

    Mourning my son has similarities to labor. The contractions of pain rush through my body like a knot that is tied tighter and tighter so that I am unable to breathe, dead along with my son. My womb becomes a grave. I feel the pain of him in my belly, a pressure bearing down on me. It will always be inside of me. And though I hope and pray that one day I will not be as great with pain as I am now, the pain will never leave me.
