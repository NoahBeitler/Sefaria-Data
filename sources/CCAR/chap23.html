   (“records [of]”) brings to a conclusion the long Tabernacle narrative and the book of Exodus. In this book, the Israelites have been transformed from slaves building store cities for Pharaoh (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e1-11">
    1:11–14
   </a>
   ) into a free people building a “home” for the God who will now dwell among them (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
    25:8
   </a>
   ). Once the Tabernacle is completed, God’s presence fills the sacred space. Just as God’s cloud and fire led the Israelites from the Sea of Reeds to Sinai and then hovered over the holy mountain, God will now be with them when the wilderness journey resumes, as recounted in the book of Numbers.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   As the parashah begins, the Israelites have fabricated all the components of the tent and its enclosure, interior, and courtyard furnishings (see
   <i>
    parashat Vayak’heil
   </i>
   ) now they inventory the collected materials (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_38.21-31">
    38:21–31
   </a>
   ). Only the instructions for the priestly vestments given in
   <i>
    parashat T’tzaveh
   </i>
   (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
    28:1–43
   </a>
   ) have not yet been fulfilled. Thus, before the Israelites erect and dedicate the Tabernacle, they must make the garments for Aaron and his descendants (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_39.1-31">
    39:1–31
   </a>
   ). The description of the vestments here is quite similar to that of the earlier instructions. However, there are some differences, most notably the virtual absence of Aaron’s name, even though he serves as the chief priestly official (the “high priest”). Instead, the final part of Exodus returns to highlighting Aaron’s brother, Moses, and his special relationship with God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   After reporting that the vestments are completed, the text presents a final summation of the construction work (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#e39-33">
    39:33–43
   </a>
   ), after which the actual assembly of the shrine can begin. God gives Moses the orders to set up the Tabernacle and install its furnishings (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_40.1-38">
    40:1–8
   </a>
   ) and then to consecrate them and also the priests (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#chap-fn9-4">
    40:9–16
   </a>
   ). All the pieces now come together under the leadership of Moses, who carries out God’s commandments to erect the shrine and place its furnishings in the proper place (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#e40-17">
    40:17–33
   </a>
   ). With the Tabernacle complete, God’s presence enters this sumptuous earthly abode (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#E40-38">
    40:34–38
   </a>
   ). Some of the language here evokes the creation of the world in
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis 1
   </a>
   , reflecting the momentous significance that the text bestows upon this event.

   Once everything is complete, Moses reviews the work and blesses the Israelites (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#e39-33">
    39:43
   </a>
   ). Finally, God’s invisible presence fills the
   <i>

   </i>
   (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#E40-38">
    40:34–35
   </a>
   ). In contrast to the prior Torah portion, where women (and men) are mentioned explicitly as contributors to the Tabernacle and as participants in essential aspects
   <a id="page_546">
   </a>
   of its construction and service, here neither women nor men are directly visible as such, apart from three specified leaders. Rather, those women (and men) remain in view while their gender recedes into the background. Indirectly—as previously mentioned donors, fabricators, and members of the collective Israelite community—they are included in the final account of the sacred portable structure erected so that God “may dwell among them” (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
    25:8

   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#chap-fn42-3">

   his section, which takes the form of archival data recorded by levitical priests, is an inventory of the metals—gold, silver, and “copper” (see at
   <a href="#exo_38.21-31">
    v. 29
   </a>
   )—used for the Tabernacle. The kind of information provided about each metal varies. Prior to the tally,
   <a href="#exo_38.21-31">

   reiterate that specially designated artisans used these materials.

   More precisely, this term probably refers to a record of things that are counted up, as in a tally. The verbal root of this noun
   <i>
    (p-k-d),
   </i>
   which gives this parashah its name, also is used in Numbers in reference to the census count (as in
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#num_1.1-54">
    Numbers 1:3
   </a>
   ).

   </i>
   This is the only verse in Exodus in which the words
   <i>
    mishkan
   </i>
   (Tabernacle) and
   <i>
    edut
   </i>
   (Pact) are used together (see at
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
    25:9
   </a>
   and
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.10-40">
    25:16
   </a>
   ); and the combination is found only three times elsewhere in the Torah (
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#N1-50">
    Numbers 1:50
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#N1-50">

   </a>
   ;
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#N10-12">
    10:11
   </a>
   ). The phrase emphasizes that the Tabernacle is the repository for God’s covenant with Israel as well as the place for God’s presence to abide. With this statement, the meaning of Sinai is transferred to the Tabernacle, ready to accompany the Israelites on their journey.

   This designation for Aaron rarely appears in Exodus. Aaron’s responsibilities as “the priest” are said to include various matters of ritual (for example,
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_27.20-21">
    27:21
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-35">

   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e30-7">

   ), judicial proceedings (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-30">
    28:29–30
   </a>
   ), and instruction (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.8-20">
    Leviticus 10:11
   </a>
   ). The Bible never refers to Aaron by the title “high priest”—a term that seems to refer to an office that developed over time so that its responsibilities included also finance and management.

   This clause appears only a few times in Exodus up to this point. Now it recurs in rapid-fire succession, fourteen times in this parashah, especially in
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_39.1-31">
    Exodus 39–40

   </i>
   Heb.
   <i>
    t’nufah
   </i>
   (“elevation offering”), which refers to a ritual used to dedicate something to God. Elevation offerings of food appear in
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e29-24">
    29:24–27
   </a>
   and of gold here and in
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-22">
    35:22
   </a>
   . This phrase is also used for “copper” (bronze) donations in this inventory (
   <a href="#exo_38.21-31">
    v. 29
   </a>
   ), but silver is inexplicably omitted.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Calculating the modern equivalents of biblical weights is imprecise; but it is estimated that a talent, which in the ancient Near East equaled three thousand shekels, would have weighed about seventy-five pounds (33 kilograms). The amassed gold would have weighed more than two thousand pounds (roughly a thousand kilograms), an unlikely amount. Thus, this inventory apparently deals in symbolic numbers, although the nature of the symbolism is no longer clear.

  <div class="tab-enin">

     <a href="#chap-fn24-1b" id="chap-fn024-1b">
      sanctuary weight.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   This may be different than the normal weight, but it may also be asserting that the priestly officials were the ones who set weights (see
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_30.11-31.18">
    30:13

   Another unlikely large and presumably symbolic amount—more than three times the quantity in the previous verse—is given for the quantity of donated silver.

   The military census that involved individual men’s contributions to the Tabernacle, mandated in
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_30.11-31.18">
    30:11–16
   </a>
   , accounts here for all of the silver collected. For some reason, the freewill contributions of silver that presumably came from both women and men (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-22">
    35:24
   </a>
   ; compare
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_11.1-12.28">

    </b>
   </i>
   This figure is equivalent to that of the military census in
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#N1-46">
    Numbers 1:46
   </a>
   ; both count only males above the age of twenty. This impossibly large and thus symbolic number, perhaps meant to include all Israelites in times to come, is slightly larger than the number of men who left Egypt: 600,000 men (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.37-42">
    Exodus 12:37

   Specification of gender does not appear explicitly in the Hebrew here, but it is implied by the act of a military census (see at

   Like gold (
   <a href="#exo_38.21-31">
    v. 24
   </a>
   ), the “copper” (or bronze) is dedicated through the ritual of the wave offering. The “copper” (or bronze) from the mirrors of the women serving “at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e38-8">
    38:8
   </a>
   ) is not mentioned, perhaps because the laver for which they donated their mirrors is omitted in the list of uses for the “copper” in the next two verses.

   he catalogue of priestly vestments is similar to that of the earlier prescriptive texts that provide instructions for making these items (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
    28:1–43
   </a>
   ). Apparently because of the focus in this parashah on construction rather than use, this unit adds technical details but omits some information about function. The most remarkable difference between the two accounts is the almost complete absence of any mention of Aaron, whose name appears some sixteen times in the equivalent unit in
   <i>
    parashat T’tzaveh
   </i>
   but only twice here (
   <a href="#exo_39.1-31">
    vv. 1, 27

   ). In contrast, Moses’ name, which is absent from the earlier account of the vestments, appears repeatedly here.

   INTRODUCTION (39:1)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The introductory verse mentions only the apparel of the chief priestly officer, whose elaborate vestments are described in considerable detail in the next section. (For the parallel prescriptive text earlier in Exodus, see
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
    28:1–5

   Although other materials are involved in making the priestly apparel, only the dyed woolen yarns, and not even the gold or the linen threads (which appear in subsequent verses), are mentioned.

   Although women are not explicitly mentioned, they are likely in view here, given that women were typically the textile workers in ancient Israel (see at
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-22">
    35:25

   ), just as Hannah is said to have made her son Samuel’s robe when he served as a priest at Shiloh (I Samuel 2:19).

   This is one of only two places where Aaron’s name is used in this narrative (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_39.1-31">
    Exodus 39
   </a>
   ), in contrast to his prominence in the equivalent prescriptive texts. His complicity in the Golden Calf incident may account for his near absence here. In effect, the text emphasizes the enduring office, not one particular officeholder. It does, however, give Moses a relatively exalted place.

   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_38.21-31">
    38:22

   ). With seven denoting totality or completeness in Semitic parlance, such repetition gives prominence to the role of Moses, not Aaron, as the authoritative conduit of God’s will, even for making the priestly garments.

   RITUAL ITEMS (39:2–21)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The vestments of the chief priestly official are not simply items of clothing; rather, they have ritual functions. This description differs from that of the earlier, prescriptive instructions (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-6">
    28:6–30
   </a>
   ) in adjusting to the different context and in being somewhat less detailed, especially by omitting information about the use of these items.

      The ephod.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The biblical sources that mention the ephod (such as Judges 8:24–27, I Samuel 30:7, and Hosea 3:4) contain such disparate information that it is difficult to understand what an ephod looked like or how it was used. Although the appearance and use of the ephod varied over time, what is constant is that the ephod always is related to ritual matters—sometime as a ritual garment, sometimes as a divinatory device, and sometimes as both. In Exodus, its details and its association with the breastpiece of decision make it likely that the ephod was worn by the priest and used for oracular (divinatory) purposes.

   According to the earlier, prescriptive text, God had specified that both the ephod and breastpiece be adorned with gemstones engraved for “remembrance” (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-6">
    28:12
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-30">
    29
   </a>
   ) with the names of the Israelite tribes. This feature has commemorative symbolic value, bringing all Israel into the Tabernacle with the chief priestly officer as he carries out the rituals thought to help secure the well-being of the people or to adjudicate their conflicts.

   </i>
   The description of the breastpiece’s manufacture does not use the longer phrase “breastpiece of decision” (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-15">
    28:15
   </a>

   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-30">

   ,
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-30">

   ), which indicates that the breastpiece plays a role in the judicial functions of the priesthood. Also missing from this passage is any mention of two associated items, the Urim and Thummim (see at
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-30">

   In addition to the ritual items, Aaron and the other priests wear special garments. The description of these garments in this section includes somewhat more detail than in the earlier, prescriptive account (

   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-40">

   The artisans make the special robe for the chief priestly officer. The full-length robe was blue, with bells and multicolored tassels in the shape of pomegranates on the skirt (see at
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-35">

    </b>
   </i>
   The sound of the bells apparently was intended to ward off danger. In this case, the danger would have been the intense holiness emanating from the presence of God as the chief priestly official enters the holy zone of the Tabernacle (

   A tunic was the standard garment for both women and men in the eastern Mediterranean region for about a thousand years (in the Late Bronze and Iron Ages, from the mid-2nd to the mid-1st millennia

   The headdress of Aaron’s sons is actually more of a cap than a turban. The headgear of the chief priestly official is more elaborate and includes a crown or diadem (

   Earlier in the text, God mandated these breeches to function as an undergarment worn by all priestly ranks, perhaps for reasons of modesty (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#chap-fn42-2">
    28:42–43

   he last unit of this parashah mirrors
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis 1
   </a>
   , in which God’s creative acts are first stated (“Let there be…”) and then carried out (“…and so it was”). The first half of
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_40.1-38">
    Exodus 40
   </a>
   is the equivalent of “Let there be…,” in which God gives Moses a final set of instructions for erecting the sacred shrine (
   <a href="#exo_40.1-38">
    vv. 1–16
   </a>
   ). The next part of the unit reflects the “…and so it was” aspect of the Tabernacle (
   <a href="#exo_40.1-38">
    vv. 17–33
   </a>
   ). Thus the erection of God’s earthly abode is tantamount to the creation of the world; indeed, as was the case for temple buildings in the ancient Near East, the Tabernacle is conceptually a microcosm of the universe. (See also

   This refers to New Year’s Day. Thus, the beginning of the existence of the shrine, which is a microcosm of the cosmos, is keyed to the creation of the world. It is as if God’s role as omnipotent creator is mirrored in and signified by God’s earthly abode. But the Tabernacle’s existence is also keyed to the beginning of Israel’s existence as a free people: it comes nine months after the people arrive at Sinai (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    19:1
   </a>
   ) and virtually on the first anniversary of the beginning of freedom, which was on the “fourteenth day of the first month” (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-2">
    12:6
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e12-18">
    18
   </a>
   ). The month is not named, but it is probably Nisan. Thus the Tabernacle would be completed in time for the first celebration of Pesach (see

   The priestly narrator frequently, as here, uses a causative form of the Hebrew verb (

   , “to stand, rise”) to indicate the establishment of the

   <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#exo_6.2-7.7">
    6:4
   </a>
   ). Using the same verb for the Tabernacle and the covenant provides a connection between these two foundational aspects of Israelite national life.

   This passage presents a final listing of the components of the sacred shrine, including the initial use of all the ritual components. Moses eclipses Aaron once more in this parashah by initiating what are otherwise considered priestly assignments. Moses already possesses sanctity, which the priests do not gain until they have been sanctified by being washed, clothed, anointed, and daubed with ritual fluids—procedures not mentioned until

   In this edition of the Torah, this clause is considered the beginning of a new unit of thought. However, it could also be translated “and Moses finished his work,” thus completing the account of Moses erecting the shrine. Either way, the language echoes

   At first glance it seems surprising that Moses and God’s presence could not be in the tent at the same time—especially in light of
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e33-7">
    33:9–11
   </a>
   , where God spoke directly to Moses inside the Tent of Meeting (outside the camp) while the cloud hovered at the entrance. However, the present passage concerns the function of the cloud (and fire) in the journey to the Promised Land that is about to start up again, not the oracular function of the tent as expressed in
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_33.1-23">

   The verb comes from the root
   <i>
    sh-k-n,

   which means “to dwell” as well as “to settle” (see at
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">

   ); it is the root for the noun
   <i>

   (Tabernacle) as well as
   <i>
    Shechinah

   (see

   God does not permanently fill the shrine. When the cloud lifts, the people dismantle and pack up the Tabernacle and then travel onward.

   . It is fitting that Exodus ends with this word; its verbal root
   <i>
    (n-s-e)

   was used frequently in Genesis for the movements of the ancestors, including their descent to Egypt (
   <a href="14_chapter_11.xhtml#ge_46.1-34">
    Genesis 46:1
   </a>
   ). The same root then appeared in Exodus to indicate the stages of travel of the Israelites from Egypt to Sinai (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.37-42">
    12:37
   </a>

   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e13-21">

   ; and
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    19:2

   ). It is also found frequently in Numbers, in reference to the wilderness wanderings (as in
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_9.15-10.36">
    Numbers 10:12
   </a>
   ). Thus, the word “journeys” situates the entire Exodus narrative within the larger story of the Torah. Just as important, the concluding verse of Exodus proclaims that the Israelites will not be alone on their long and difficult journey to the Promised Land. Rather, they are to be guided night and day by the luminous cloud of God’s presence.

    HIS PARASHAH DESCRIBES

   the priestly vestments: the ephod and breastpiece of gold, blue, purple, and crimson yarns of fine twisted linen, the pure blue woven robe with its pomegranates of blue, purple, and twisted crimson yarns on the hem, the tunics of fine linen woven work to be worn by Aaron and his sons, their headdress and decorated turbans of fine linen, and their sashes of fine embroidered blue, purple, and crimson linen yarns. Besides the priests’ vestments, the text also mentions the hangings and curtains used to decorate the Tabernacle and to separate the rooms.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Producing textiles like these required a series of steps—carding, spinning, dyeing, and weaving the cotton, linen, or wool—tasks typically performed by women in the ancient Near East. Graves of women and girls often include weaving equipment such as bobbins and loom weights, whereas men’s and boy’s graves lack such equipment. Likewise, 4000-year-old graves of women in Turkmenia include specialized knives similar to those used by carpet weavers who live there today. An ancient Egyptian wooden model of a weaver’s house shows women at work weaving, spinning, and winding the yarns. A relief found at Susa, dated to circa 1000

  <div class="tab-enin">
   The objects described in this parashah were for use in the Tabernacle and later in the Jerusalem Temple. What kind of staff maintained those facilities? Consider that Mesopotamian and Egyptian temples were large estates that employed thousands of workers. Female workers associated with these large temples cared for the sick and served as midwives, cooks and pastry chefs, menial cleaners, and janitors, as well as spinners and weavers.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   According to Exodus, women performed the skilled work involved in preparing the yarn and weaving the fabrics for the Tabernacle (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-22">
    35:25–26
   </a>
   ). Although women are not mentioned explicitly in this parashah, archeological evidence and biblical references to women spinning and weaving (Proverbs 31:19; II Kings 23:7; compare Isaiah 19:9) allow us to reconstruct the vital role that Exodus presumes that women played in the construction of the Tabernacle and its elaborate objects.

   (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_38.21-31">
    38:22
   </a>
   ). Although no women are mentioned in Bezalel’s genealogy, rabbinic tradition connected him with Moses’ sister Miriam. Hur’s father was Caleb, and Caleb’s wife was Ephrath (I Chronicles 2:19). But Midrash
   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah
   </i>
   1.13 and 1.17 suggested that Ephrath was, in fact, another name for Miriam—who was also identified with Puah, one of the heroic midwives of
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_1.1-22">
    Exodus 1
   </a>
   . All of these conflated identities combined to make Miriam the great-grandmother of Bezalel. According to
   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah
   </i>
   48.4, Miriam was not only Bezalel’s great-grandmother; she was also
   <a id="page_561">
   </a>
   the source of his inspiration. As one of the two midwives who saved the Israelite infants, Miriam was rewarded with special access to wisdom. This midrashic tradition is based on the biblical statement that God “established households [literally: houses]” for the midwives (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E1-15">
    1:21
   </a>
   ); according to the Rabbis, Miriam’s house was the house of wisdom. Since Bezalel, too, is associated with wisdom (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-30">
    35:31
   </a>
   ), the Rabbis assumed that the source of his special knowledge must have been Miriam. Thus, women played key roles at both the beginning and the conclusion of the book of Exodus: Moses could not have been saved without the ingenuity and bravery of women—including the midwives, his mother and sister, and Pharaoh’s daughter—nor could the Tabernacle have been built without the wisdom that Miriam bequeathed to Bezalel.

   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah

   52.5 invokes the relationship between a man and a woman to reflect upon the bond between God and Israel. However, while most such interpretations envisioned a marital relationship in which God was imagined as the husband and Israel as the wife, here we see something different. Based on Song of Songs 3:11, “O maidens of Zion, go forth / And gaze upon King Solomon / Wearing the crown that his mother / Gave him on his wedding day, / On his day of bliss,” Rabbi Eleazar ben Rabbi Yose suggested that God first loved Israel like a father loves his daughter, and then, as God’s love increased, like a man loves his sister. Finally, God’s love for Israel reached the point where it was like the love a man has for his mother. Thus, each successive example represented a more intense love, including this striking idealization of the relationship between mother and son. Rabbi Eleazar then offered an interpretation based on the marital relationship; he concluded with a reflection on the destruction of the Temple and the promise that God would rebuild Jerusalem. Here, the proof text is Isaiah 51:3, and the image is of God comforting Zion in a time when “joy and gladness are found, thanksgiving and the strains of song.” Ultimately, we learn from this midrash that when we read about the Tabernacle, we are to imagine both its destruction and its ultimate rebuilding. Above all, we are to remember that the loving and intimate relationship between God and Israel—whichever relational imagery we use—remains intact.

   </i>
   (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#e40-17">
    40:17
   </a>
   ). The rabbinic association of women with Rosh Chodesh, the celebration of the New Moon and the beginning of a month, has become well known. The usual explanation is that Rosh Chodesh was a reward for the Israelite women’s refusal to contribute their jewelry to the making of the Golden Calf (Midrash
   <i>
    Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer
   </i>
   45). However, another rabbinic tradition also links women with Rosh Chodesh via the erection of the Tabernacle. As we read in this verse, the Tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month, namely, Rosh Chodesh Nisan. According to the
   <i>
    Shulchan Aruch
   </i>
   and its commentaries (
   <i>
    Orach Chaim
   </i>
   417.1), this day was the original women’s holiday, from which the idea of Rosh Chodesh arose. Women were connected with the erection of the Tabernacle because they were the first to contribute when the Tabernacle was being built (Nachmanides on 35:22). Women’s support of the Tabernacle strengthens the significance of their earlier refusal to contribute to the Golden Calf: it indicates that women are able to discern when a cause is worthy of their generosity.

    OR THE FIRST TIME
   </small>
   in the Torah, with the completion of the
   <i>
    Mishkan,
   </i>
   the presence of God has a regular home, an earthly residence. And this home is not only for God; it is a “Tent of Meeting” for Israel as well. When God’s presence enters the
   <i>
    Mishkan,
   </i>
   it is clear that Israel’s work in building this sacred structure has been blessed. For the first time, by learning from past mistakes, Israel—all Israel—has a place to experience God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In other words, the same Israelites who once sought to contain power and divinity within the idol of the Golden Calf (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
    Exodus 32
   </a>
   ) now create the
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_33.1-36.7">
    Exodus 35–40
   </a>
   ), which, while made of the same materials and by some of the very same processes, emphatically does not attempt to contain God. Having been given an explicit opportunity to fall again into the trap of deifying something material, having been handed the opportunity to make a cage for God, the people instead create the
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   and regard it only as a space, not as a stand-in or a container for God (Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg,
   <i>
    The Particulars of Rapture,
   </i>
   2001, pp. 480–481, 330–333). Once this purpose is established, God’s presence dwells in the
   <i>
    Mishkan,
   </i>
   in their midst; the process of
   <i>
    t’shuvah
   </i>
   (repentance) is complete.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Given the prohibitions against making images of God, the disaster of the Golden Calf, and the lesson the Israelites have begun to learn that God cannot be represented physically, we might expect the presence of God in the
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   to be without form altogether, invisible. Wouldn’t God’s complete lack of form at this moment make perfect sense in light of the Israelites’ newfound awareness and understanding?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   However, God’s presence is manifested in the
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   in not one but two different ways: as a cloud by day and fire by night. Why does God come to the Israelites (and to us, as we read) in these very common forms? Wouldn’t the lesson of the Golden Calf be more clearly enforced if now God’s presence remained untainted by any physical form?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Perhaps these manifestations exist precisely in order to teach the Israelites that an experience of God can exist within the visual and tangible realms. That is, the problem with worshipping the Golden Calf was not that the calf could be seen; it was that the Golden Calf was worshipped as if it contained God entirely, as if God was nowhere else. Here, the Israelites learn that an encounter with God does not have to be so abstract, so removed from their sensory experience that they are left without any means of comprehending or describing it. In other words, the divine experience can include things seen. However, it must also transform our grasp of the seen object, our understanding of God, and, by extension, the act of seeing and the seer.

   Remember the narrative of the Burning Bush that was on fire but not consumed (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E3-6">
    3:1–4
   </a>
   ). This phenomenon is contrary to our understanding of what happens when a bush catches on fire. For Moses, the very existence of the Burning Bush not consumed awakens the possibility that there is something divine in that fire. God could just have easily come to Moses without a Burning Bush; however, this is what enables Moses to find evidence of God’s presence. Before God even addresses Moses, he sees the fire acting differently and realizes that there is more to the world than what he knows.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Later, we read about two pillars that accompany the Israelites as they leave Egypt: a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e13-21">
    13:20–22
   </a>
   ). The cloud is a signpost and the fire an illuminated guide in the
   <a id="page_563">
   </a>
   darkness; both show Israel the path to follow on their journey through the wilderness. But note that neither object acts naturally. The cloud does not blanket and obscure, as we expect clouds to do; instead, it is contained in a pillar and provides direction for the Israelites. Similarly, the fire does not spread and destroy whatever is in its path, as we expect fire to do; like the cloud, the fire is contained, a giant torch. In both of these manifestations, the Israelites began to see, just as Moses saw in the bush, the possibility of natural things, things of-this-earth, being bent and shaped in unnatural, divine ways.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Focusing on our parashah (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#E40-38">
    40:34–38
   </a>
   ), God’s presence now dwells in the completed
   <i>
    Mishkan,
   </i>
   not as something invisible to Israel, but as something very familiar. Just as before, God’s presence is manifested as a cloud by day and fire by night. Here, too, the familiar acts in an unusual way. The cloud remains in the
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   ; it does not drift or dissipate. Even more remarkably, the fire burns night after night and does not consume anything; each morning, the
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   remains intact (Zornberg, p. 492). These manifestations—these miracles—allow Israel to find and perceive God’s presence but still remain aware that their perceptions cannot begin to encompass the totality of that presence.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Had God dwelt invisibly in the
   <i>
    Mishkan,
   </i>
   had the Israelites never seen God’s presence there, they might have assumed that seeking visual encounters with God is a form of idolatry. By appearing “in the view of all the house of Israel” (
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#E40-38">
    40:38
   </a>
   ), God teaches that the problem with worshipping idols is not the visual experience itself; the problem occurs when the act merely confirms our preconceptions about God (Zornberg, p. 482). The Israelites see God’s presence in natural, familiar forms that then transcend and undermine those forms. This seeing, and this dissonance, tests their understanding of the world and leads to a more complex relationship with God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   So it is for us: We need not be wary of looking for visual evidence of God’s presence in the world around us. Seeking God’s presence with our eyes is not idolatrous; it is only idolatry when we “know” in advance what we will see, when our expectations restrain us. Unfortunately, we may have been so afraid of making idols that we have limited ourselves to divine experiences that are abstract and often detached, expecting ourselves to develop a relationship with God without using our eyes. What would happen if we started looking for God’s presence in fire and clouds once more? How much do our relationships with God stand to gain from our actually seeing what may have been there all along? At the very least, we will benefit from the search alone, from our looking day and night. And at best, it is possible that if we look, we will see. And then, we will never see the same way again, for we ourselves will have changed.
