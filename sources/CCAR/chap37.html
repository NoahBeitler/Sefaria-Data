   (“Send for yourself”) continues the theme in Numbers of challenges to Moses’ leadership. In the previous parashah, Miriam and Aaron challenge Moses’ leadership (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
    Numbers 12
   </a>
   ); here, several tribal leaders—and ultimately the populace—do so. The parashah opens with the Israelites apparently nearing the end of their wilderness trek as they prepare to enter Canaan from the south. In anticipation of the invasion, Moses chooses scouts to reconnoiter Canaan. The goal of the expedition is twofold: to assess the strength of the indigenous populations and the strongholds in which they reside, and also to investigate the productivity of the land. One could argue that the venture is superfluous, since God has already ordained the conquest of Canaan by Israel. Seemingly, the objective is to test the faithfulness of the scouts and the Israelites as a whole.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   The theme of rebellion at the heart of this parashah centers on the events in
   <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_13.1-33">
    Numbers 13–14
   </a>
   : the reconnaissance of Canaan, the scouts’ report, the Israelites’ response, and God’s reaction. The keys to the story and subsequent wilderness accounts are the negativity expressed about the mission by ten of the twelve scouts as well as by the populace, and the consequences of that attitude. Only two scouts, Caleb and Joshua, remain enthusiastic about entering the Promised Land, thereby demonstrating trust in God. The sin of faithlessness, exemplified by the majority, threatens the extermination of all Israel. Only Moses’ intercession, coupled with God’s mercy, saves the people, but not without a heavy price: condemnation to forty years of wandering and certain death for the entire wilderness generation.

   The remaining portion of the parashah (
   <a href="#num_15.1-41">
    15:1–41
   </a>
   ) focuses on a variety of laws, mostly relating to the sacrificial system. The delineation of laws is interrupted by a case study involving the willful breaking of the law: the desecration of Shabbat. The parashah then ends with the commandment to wear “fringes”
   <i>
    (tzitzit)
   </i>
   on one’s garment as a reminder to obey God’s laws. Notably, all these laws, even that of the
   <i>
    tzitzit
   </i>
   , are designated for all Israel—and apparently are inclusive of women. Otherwise, there is no explicit attention to women or to issues specifically relating to them. For implicit issues concerning women, see the comments on the sacrificial food such as the
   <i>
    challah
   </i>
   (bread dough offering,
   <a href="#num15-19">
    15:19–21
   </a>
   ). Another indirect way to consider the roles of women in this parashah is to compare the story of the scouts in this parashah with the narrative involving Rahab the prostitute and the scouts in Joshua 2 (see introduction to
   <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_13.1-33">
    Numbers 13
   </a>
   , below).

   he opening of this Torah portion is set in the Israelite encampment in the wilderness. At God’s command, Moses appoints twelve chieftains, one from each tribe, for a scouting expedition to Canaan to spy out the land and its inhabitants. During their reconnaissance, the scouts cut down a huge cluster of grapes, as well as pomegranates and figs, to bring back to camp as samples of the land’s produce. As they make their report, the scouts claim to have encountered populations of giants, inhabitants that dwarf their own size, convincing ten of the scouts that any conquest attempt is doomed to failure. Notably, subsequent scouting expeditions mentioned in the Bible produce the opposite effect, frightening the enemy rather than the Israelites (see Joshua 2; Judges 18). Most significant is the story about Rahab, the harlot in Jericho who risks her life by hiding the two Israelite spies sent by Joshua. In that account, a woman of Canaanite origin is depicted as a God-fearing individual who trusts in Israel’s victory. In essence, she becomes the hero of the story, the conduit to Israel’s military success.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The narrative in Numbers is a conflation of at least two traditions that reflect different written sources and result in discrepancies. (On J, E, and P as the scholarly names for those sources, see Women and Interpretation of the Torah,
   <a href="fm-06.xhtml">
    page xxxvi
   </a>
   .) The differences revolve around two issues: the geographical area of Canaan that is scouted, and the number of scouts who bring a positive report. In the earlier version (JE), the scouts reconnoiter the southern portion of Canaan (
   <a href="#num13-17">
    13:17
   </a>
   ), and Caleb alone recommends that Israel proceed with the conquest (
   <a href="#num13-30">
    13:30
   </a>
   ). The later priestly account (P) expands the scouting expedition so that they traverse the entire land of Canaan (
   <a href="#num13-21">
    13:21
   </a>
   ), plus it adds Joshua as a spokesman for undertaking the conquest (
   <a href="#num14-6">
    14:6–9
   </a>
   ).

   MOSES CHOOSES AND INSTRUCTS THE SCOUTS (13:1–20)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The scouts represent the twelve tribes of Israel. The text reiterates their leadership status, probably to underscore their ultimate failure as leaders and to highlight their faithlessness. Moses instructs them to assess the strength of Canaan’s inhabitants, both the size of their population and the settlements in which they reside. The scouts are also to evaluate the productivity of the land and return with samples of the fruit of the season (summer).

   Canaanite settlements in the Bronze and Iron Ages consisted both of unwalled villages and of walled cities with fortified gates. The latter were constructed to withstand attacks and sieges; they required more advanced military machinery to penetrate. This information would have been strategically vital to a conquest plan.

   THE SCOUTS RECONNOITER CANAAN (13:21–24)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The expedition outlined in these verses reflects a conflation of two traditions: the scouting of the entire land (
   <a href="#num13-21">
    v. 21
   </a>
   ) and the scouting of only the area of the city of Hebron and south (
   <a href="#num13-21">
    vv. 22–24
   </a>
   ). In the region of Hebron, the scouts encounter clans of aboriginal giants.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The grapes, pomegranates, and figs that they bring back—all late summer fruit—suggest the season of the expedition. But since in the Bible these fruits commonly symbolize the productivity of the Promised Land, they may also be simply a literary device.

  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   At first, Caleb is the only scout who speaks favorably of an Israelite conquest of Canaan. Joshua’s role as a faithful leader does not appear until later in the narrative (
   <a href="#num14-6">
    14:6
   </a>
   ), which is a section clearly derived from an alternate tradition. (Caleb, the chieftain who represents Judah, will continue to play a key role in the conquest of Canaan, particularly in the tribal territory of Judah. In Joshua 15:13–19 and Judges 1:12–15, he promises his daughter Achsah in marriage to the conqueror of the city of Kiriath-Sepher, also known as Debir. The narrative then gives voice to Achsah as she cleverly appeals to Caleb’s sense of honor as a father, prompting him to bestow property with water springs in the Negeb to her and her new husband, Othniel.)

   They and the Nephilim (v. 33) are giants or super-humans mentioned also in other biblical texts.
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_6.1-4">
    Genesis 6:1–4
   </a>
   recounts the origin of the Nephilim. David’s Philistine adversary, Goliath, is depicted as a giant (I Samuel 17:4) descended from another group of giants, the Rephaim (I Chronicles 20:5–6).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   It is difficult to interpret the meaning of “giants” in the scouts’ report. In the case of the Philistines, it may be that their tall headdresses (pictured in Egyptian art) contributed to their gigantic image. More importantly, the report of giants in the land makes the Canaanites more intimidating and their eventual defeat by the Israelites more spectacular. Notably, Anakites are also mentioned in Egyptian literature (Papyrus Anastasi 1,
   <i>
    Context of Scripture,
   </i>
   2002, 3:13) where they are identified as Shasu (a nomadic group) about 6’8”–8’6” (2–2.6 meters) tall. The Shasu were enemies of the Egyptians and their depiction as giants functions as a literary device similar to that in the biblical story. Some scholars actually connect the Shasu with proto-Israelites.

   </i>
   Most likely, this phrase alludes to the results of frequent warfare, which ravaged Canaan (see Ezekiel 36:13–14). An alternate explanation is that the expression refers to the infertility of the land, but this would contradict the scouts’ earlier report and hence is less likely.

   n the continuous cycle of rebellions by the Israelites in the wilderness, this one is the most egregious. The ten scouts who incite the populace advocate abandoning Israel’s ultimate goal of settling the Promised Land. This extreme display of faithlessness before God, similar to that in the Golden Calf episode (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
    Exodus 32
   </a>
   ), provokes God’s fiery anger—which threatens to annihilate the whole nation. As before, Moses becomes an intercessor, a part he has learned to play well. Still, here the punishment is most severe and far-reaching.

   THE SCOUTS DISCOURAGE THE PEOPLE WITH THEIR REPORT (14:1–5)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Reacting to the scouts’ frightening description of the fierce inhabitants of Canaan, the Israelites cry out in fear. Clearly, they have accepted the veracity of the scouts’ military analysis and expect to be defeated. They are ready to return to Egypt rather than face the enemy in Canaan, apparently having forgotten the wrath of the Egyptian army that pursued them when they escaped from Egypt. It appears that the series of murmurings and rebellions in the wilderness has reached a climax at the gates of the Promised Land.

   </i>
   Several biblical texts describe situations in which women and children are carried off as booty. In one case, I Samuel 30, David rescues the wives and children of his men (and his own family as well). Commonly, the attackers kill the captive wives but keep alive the virgins, “women who have not known a man” (see Judges 21). Deuteronomic law regulates the treatment of women taken captive by Israelite men (
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_21.10-21">
    Deuteronomy 21:10–14
   </a>

   In the face of Moses and Aaron’s temporary abdication of leadership, Joshua and Caleb assume responsibility. They staunchly articulate that the outcome of the mission will be determined by Israel’s God, not by military fortitude. The extent of the people’s rebellion is evident by their readiness to stone Joshua and Caleb. It is only the sudden appearance of God’s Presence before the people that saves them.

   This act, a sign of grief and mourning, probably took the place of mutilating oneself with gashes and the like (a biblical prohibition,
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#L19-28">
    Leviticus 19:28
   </a>
   ). Tearing one’s garment is an ancient custom that has survived to the present day. In the Bible, for example, King David’s daughter Tamar rends her garments, puts dust on her head, and cries loudly, grieving after her half-brother Amnon rapes her (II Samuel 13; compare also
   <a href="13_chapter_10.xhtml#chap10-4-fn9">
    Genesis 44:13
   </a>
   ).

  <div class="head2" id="num_vv.10-38">
   GOD PUNISHES THE COMMUNITY FOR ITS LACK OF FAITH (14:10–38)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   God is prepared to eradicate all Israel in a plague—with the exception of Moses, from whose descendants God proposes to create a new nation. Since the sins surrounding the scouting expedition and the Golden Calf (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
    Exodus 32
   </a>
   ) are the only two events eliciting such severe divine retribution, it seems that their gravity is comparable. As in the past, Moses intercedes on behalf of the people. He argues first that God’s reputation among the nations as a most powerful deity must be preserved; his second argument appeals to God’s attribute of mercy (see
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#chap-fn6-4">
    Exodus 34:6–7
   </a>
   ). Moses’ lengthy prayer for the nation contrasts sharply with his very brief prayer on behalf of his sister Miriam (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-13">
    12:13
   </a>
   ), who was stricken with a skin disease for challenging Moses’ position.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   As is often the case in the Torah, God responds favorably to Moses’ plea, promising to spare the nation. The Israelites are condemned to wander in the wilderness until nearly all the adults have died, presumably of natural causes (
   <a href="#num14-22">
    vv. 22–23
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#num14-28">
    28–33
   </a>
   ); but the ten faithless scouts are struck down on the spot (
   <a href="#num14-36">
    vv. 36–37
   </a>
   ). The tribe of Levi is not among those who are doomed to die in the wilderness, apparently because it had not been represented among the scouts. Of the remaining Israelites, only Joshua and Caleb and the children “born in the wilderness” will enter the Promised Land.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   God’s decree in this passage is woven from two sources or traditions, JE (
   <a href="#num14-20">
    vv. 20–24
   </a>
   ) and a priestly source (
   <a href="#num14-26">
    vv. 26–38
   </a>
   ). (On these sources, see Women and Interpretation of the Torah,
   <a href="fm-06.xhtml">
    page xxxvi
   </a>
   .) In the former, only Caleb is singled out to be spared (
   <a href="#num14-24">
    v. 24
   </a>
   ) because he alone among the scouts was faithful; in the latter, both Caleb and Joshua are listed as those who will settle Canaan (

   The entire formula of God’s attributes is found in
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#chap-fn6-4">
    Exodus 34:6–7
   </a>
   ; portions are quoted here as well as in the Decalogue (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#chap-fn4-3">
    Exodus 20:5–6
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu5-9">
    Deuteronomy 5:9–10
   </a>
   ). Moses is clearly appealing to God’s merciful nature, which should prevent God from carrying out the threat to slaughter the entire nation. Simultaneously, Moses notes that God does not remit full punishment; in fact, future generations share the punishment of their guilty ancestors. Deuteronomy offers a different perspective on this matter, arguing that subsequent generations are punished only if they persist in those sins (
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu5-9">
    Deuteronomy 5:9–10
   </a>
   ).

   Except for Joshua, Caleb, and the tribe of Levi (

    v. 2

   Literally, “bearing your harlotry,” indicating the infidelity of the older generation to God. The Bible often uses the term “harlotry” metaphorically to refer to Israelite idolatrous practices, a manifestation of their infidelity to God (see especially Hosea 1–3). This pejorative image is underscored in some of the biblical depictions of the harlot (as in Proverbs 23:27).

   The ten scouts who incited the rebellion with their negative report die in a plague sent by God. Their sin is too grave to mitigate. That they get no second chance is a reflection of just how seriously the Bible treats the responsibilities of leadership; indeed, these scouts demonstrated the huge impact that a leader can have.

   THE PEOPLE ATTEMPT A MILITARY EXPEDITION (14:39–45)

  <div class="tab-enin">
   A group of Israelites attempts to invade Canaan despite a warning to the contrary. Their motivation is either regret for their previous open lack of trust in God or a hope to reverse God’s decree. In any case, the invasion fails, and they are defeated. The message here is clear: without God’s blessing and presence in battle (marked by the accompanying Ark), conquest is impossible. The function of the Ark in the military camp is also emphasized in this section.

   egal material interrupts the narrative of the wandering in the wilderness. Its purpose, immediately following God’s punishment of the faithless Israelites, may be to reiterate the promise that eventually they will indeed inherit Canaan—as signaled by the introduction to the first two sets of laws: “When you enter the land” (
   <a href="#num15-2">
    vv. 2
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#num15-18">
    18
   </a>
   ). The laws in this unit, with the exception of the last, deal with the sacrificial system. The last law, about
   <i>
    tzitzit
   </i>
   (fringes), is preceded by a case study of a wood-gatherer who violates Shabbat and is stoned to death by the community. The placement of the law of
   <i>
    tzitzit
   </i>
   after that case is probably designed to illustrate how to prevent such violations of the commandments in the first place.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Many scholars maintain that the laws in
   <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_15.1-41">
    Numbers 15
   </a>
   are late (post-exilic), serving to complement and supplement earlier laws in other parts of the Torah.

   SACRIFICES AND THEIR ACCOMPANIMENTS (15:1–16)

   This section of laws addresses the individual Israelite regarding the correct combination of ingredients for the various sacrifices. The rituals outlined here call for animal burnt offerings (
   <i>
    olah)
   </i>
   and offerings of well-being (
   <i>
    zevach
   </i>
   ) to be accompanied by a grain and oil mixture and wine (see
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">

   </a>
   ;
   <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.3">

   ), the combination being reminiscent of a complete meal. In the case of sacrifices, the meal is for the Deity. Although the Bible describes these offerings as “producing an odor pleasing to
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">

   CHALLAH: OFFERING OF THE FIRST DOUGH (15:17–21)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The
   <i>
    challah
   </i>
   (dough offering) is the first part of dough made from grains prepared in the kneading basin. While somewhat analogous to the first fruits offering (
   <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_26.1-15">
    Deuteronomy 26:1–11
   </a>
   ) and the tithes (
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu14-22">
    Deuteronomy 14:22–29
   </a>
   ), the dough offering seems to be an additional levy, in this case for a product manufactured from already tithed grain. The dough, a gift dedicated to the sanctuary, is given to the priest; in turn, the homes of the Israelites are blessed (see Ezekiel 44:30). Women played an important role in food production in ancient Israel (see also at
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-1">
    Exodus 16:3
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#e25-30">
    25:30
   </a>
   ). Not only did they perform agricultural tasks, but also they prepared the family meals. Making bread would have been a woman’s daily chore. Tabuns (“ovens,” from the Arabic) are often uncovered in excavations of residential courtyards. The Bible describes several women as kneading bread or cakes (Sarah in
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#g18-6">
    Genesis 18:6
   </a>
   ; the unnamed medium of En-dor in I Samuel 28:24; Tamar in II Samuel 13:8; see also at
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_26.26">
    Leviticus 26:26

   the “cutting off” of a person, is a punishment enacted by the Divine.

   A CASE OF WILLFUL SHABBAT VIOLATION (15:32–36)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The case of the wood-gatherer illustrates a most severe violation of the law, the willful desecration of Shabbat, which is a capital offense. It is not totally clear why Moses consults God regarding the offender’s punishment. Possibly, the reason is that earlier legislative texts that prescribe the death penalty are unclear as to whether punishment is to be exacted by a human court or by God (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e31-12">
    Exodus 31:14–15
   </a>
   ). So that no doubt remains, God sentences the violator to stoning at the hands of the community. This serious offense apparently is an affront to the entire community.

   THE LAW OF TZITZIT (15:37–41)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In antiquity, tassels and fringes were common on Canaanite and Mesopotamian clothing, and they held special significance. For example, prophets from the Babylonian city of Mari (second millennium) legitimated their oracles to the king by sending a fringe from their garment. Symbolically, the fringe was like a signature. The imprinting of fringes on clay tablets was also a way of endorsing or verifying a written document. Like garments and hair, fringes were considered part of the individual’s identity; thus, for example, giving one’s fringe to another person signified a pledge of loyalty. Artistic depictions from these cultures show women wearing tasseled garments, especially women of high status.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Since in the ancient Near East both genders customarily wore fringed garments, and since biblical laws are commonly prescribed for the people as a whole, we can assume that the law of
   <i>
    tzitzit
   </i>
   was ordained for all Israelites, females and males. According to this text, the purpose of the tassels on the corners of the outer garments was to call the Israelites to action regarding the fulfillment of the commandments. What seems to distinguish these tassels from the more popular garment fringes is the addition of a colored cord that is to stand out in contrast to the other tassel fibers and remind the wearer of the commandments. It is probably not accidental that this cord is identical to the one that hangs from the high priest’s headdress (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-36">
    Exodus 28:37
   </a>
   ). The
   <i>
    tzitzit
   </i>
   on the garments of Israelites identified them as being holy to God and symbolically may have connected them to the priests. Israelites who pledged loyalty to God also would have been loyal to the priests who oversaw God’s laws.

    HE SCOUTS DISPATCHED
   </small>
   to investigate the nature of the Promised Land have suffered from a bad reputation. The Torah and the commentators blame them for one generation’s loss of the land, for forty years of wandering through the wilderness, and for Moses’ untimely demise just beyond the border of the land. The ten scouts, however, can be seen in a different light.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   When they commence their reconnaissance mission, all that the scouts and the people of Israel have heard of their destination is that God promised it to their ancestors, that it flows with milk and honey, and that it is populated by other peoples. The scouts’ uncertainty as to whether Israel really belongs in its Promised Land results from their lack of knowledge and familiarity with this place. They experience Canaan through the filter of God’s description and probe its veracity more than they investigate the landscape. Because they are unable to find evidence that legitimates God’s promise of the land, the scouts reject promise and land alike.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The scouts begin by corroborating God’s description: “it does indeed flow with milk and honey” (
   <a href="#num13-27">
    13:27
   </a>
   ), and it is inhabited by other people; but they go on to invert the elements of God’s version. The land flowing with milk and honey becomes the land that eats its inhabitants; it is not like a nourishing mother offering sweet milk, but a cannibalistic mother not to be trusted (
   <a href="#num13-32">
    13:32
   </a>
   ). The peoples of Canaan are no ordinary nations, but Nephilim—a race of demi-gods born from the union of the sons of God and the daughters of humans (
   <a href="#num13-33">
    13:33
   </a>
   ; see also at
   <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_6.9-9.29">
    Genesis 6:24
   </a>
   ). Next to their “enormous stature” the Israelites seem like “grasshoppers.” In the land of primordial giants, Israel’s ancestors are nowhere to be seen.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   At this juncture, the majority of the scouts and the people have no will to wage war against giants or the land’s inhabitants; better they should have no homeland than engage in what seem to be fruitless wars. The scouts’ report fuels a narrative of opposition to the Promised Land—the place is a curse and not a blessing! It also opens up the possibility of a new identity: being an Israelite resistant to the notion that the people belong within a circumscribed territory. Instead of an inaugural vision, what the scouts report makes Israel want to go back to Egypt (
   <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num14-26">
    Numbers 14:34
   </a>
   ). The scouts’ story is the anti-myth of the Promised Land.

   (
   <a href="#num13-2">
    13:2

   ). A hyperliteral translation of the first three words of this verse reads, “Send for yourself men.” In his 1602 commentary, the
   <i>
    Kli Yakar
   </i>
   (Rabbi Efraim Shlomo of Luntshits, Poland) claims that while the Israelite men of the wilderness generation hated the Land of Israel, the Israelite women loved it. His proof is based on the argument that the demand of the discontented Israelites, “Let us head back for Egypt” (
   <a href="#num14-4">
    14:4
   </a>
   ), represents the feelings of all the men, while “Give us a holding [in the Land of Israel] among our father’s kinsmen!” (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num27-4">
    27:4
   </a>
   )—although formally attributed only to the daughters of Zelophehad—actually represents the feelings of all of the women.
   <a id="page_887">
   </a>
   Based on these generalizations, the
   <i>
    Kli Yakar
   </i>
   claims that if God had chosen the scouts, God would have selected female scouts who loved the land, in order to ensure a positive report. Instead, when Moses was given permission to choose the scouts (“for yourself”), he made the tactical error of sending men instead.

   ). Caleb, introduced for the first time in this verse, is identified by the names of his father and of his tribe. His wife’s name, not surprisingly, is not included here, but she is identified in the Midrash. In fact, two wives are mentioned—each in a different midrashic text—and it is unclear if the Rabbis believed that he was married to both women at the same time, or to one after the other, or whether the two teachings existed independently. The wife more commonly connected with Caleb is Miriam, the sister of Moses
   <i>
    (Sh’mot Rabbah
   </i>
   1.17). Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s daughter, who had adopted Moses and whom rabbinic literature identifies as Bitya, is also described as Caleb’s wife (BT
   <i>
    M’gillah
   </i>
   13a). Neither of these marriages is mentioned in the Bible, and each is derived from a complex rabbinic interpretation of different genealogical lists in the book of Chronicles (I Chronicles 2:18–19 for Miriam; I Chronicles 4:18 for Bitya).

   <a href="#num15-19">
    15:19
   </a>
   ). This verse describes the commandment of
   <i>
    challah.
   </i>
   This commandment does not mandate the eating of special loaves of bread on Shabbat (known later in Judaism also as “challah”) but applies instead to the baking process. To perform the mitzvah of
   <i>
    challah,
   </i>
   the baker ritually removes a tiny portion of the raw dough and recites a specific blessing. When the Temple stood in Jerusalem, this consecrated portion was to be eaten by the priests. Since the destruction of the Temple in 70
   <small>
    C.E.
   </small>
   , the piece of separated dough is to be burned in the oven and thrown away. Separating
   <i>
    challah
   </i>
   is one of three commandments that are traditionally and specifically associated with—and performed by—women. (The other two are candle lighting for Shabbat and the rituals concerning menstrual purity.)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Bread baking is usually regarded as a female activity, but it may also be seen as the exemplar of the many mundane tasks needed to provide physical nourishment for one’s family. The anonymous author of the 13th-century
   <i>
    Sefer haChinuch
   </i>
   (385:1) emphasized this latter aspect of bread baking when he suggested that the commandment of
   <i>
    challah
   </i>
   allows women to take an ordinary act and elevate it to the spiritual. While eating the bread feeds the body, the ritual aspect of making the bread feeds the soul.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Midrash
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   17.8, which connects the idea of
   <i>
    challah
   </i>
   with the creation of humankind, takes a less positive view of women’s fulfillment of this commandment. This midrash imagines that at the moment of human creation God removed a small portion of the newly formed earth for a special purpose, the creation of Adam. Thus, Adam became the
   <i>
    challah
   </i>
   of the world. Eve, the first woman, corrupted Adam by encouraging him to eat from the forbidden Tree of Knowledge. According to this rabbinic view, the commandment of
   <i>
    challah
   </i>
   was specifically given to women as a reminder of Eve’s sin and as a means of spiritual atonement.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   [Some of the extant early modern supplicatory prayers in Yiddish (
   <i>
    tkhines
   </i>
   ) were intended for women to recite while separating
   <i>
    challah.
   </i>
   These prayers refer to the ancient bringing of tithes and recall female participation in ancient Temple worship. They also invoke the messianic era when the Temple’s rites will be restored. One such supplication requests that an angel guard the baking and prevent the bread from burning, just as angels had guarded the

   the scouts to survey the land of Canaan, he gives them a list of very specific things to investigate. He charges them: “Go up there into the Negeb and on into the hill country, and see what kind of country it is. Are the people who dwell in it strong or weak, few or many? Is the country in which they dwell good or bad? Are the towns they live in open or fortified? Is the soil rich or poor? Is it wooded or not?” (
   <a href="#num13-17">
    13:17–20
   </a>
   ). Twelve emissaries go out and return after forty days, reporting on what they saw in this exotic new land. All but two of the scouts are punished later; victims of a plague, they die in the wilderness.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   What is their sin? According to our tradition, they sin by not trusting God’s vision and not having faith: “How long will this people spurn Me, and how long will they have no faith in Me despite all the signs that I have performed in their midst?” (
   <a href="#num14-11">
    14:11
   </a>
   ). Furthermore, they sin because they “caused the whole community to mutter against him [Moses] by spreading calumnies about the land” (
   <a href="#num14-36">
    14:36
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   I question not only the nature of their sin, but also Moses’ approach to their mission. Moses’ instructions divide the world into either/or categories that ignore the nuances within a complex reality. Instead of asking such specific questions, what if he had said to them, “When you return, tell us what you see. How did you experience this new place? What was the land like? How were the people?” Perhaps these kinds of open-ended questions would have led the scouts to bring back a different report. At least these sorts of instructions might have given them more room to develop their own stories in a less dualistic fashion; the scouts might have been inspired to bring back a different description of what they saw.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Or is it simply a matter of perspective? After all, the twelve emissaries all observe and experience the same things, and yet two of them return with an account that is entirely different from that of the other ten.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   In his book
   <i>
    The Courage to Create
   </i>
   (1975), Rollo May writes, “We are called upon to do something new, to confront a no-man’s-land, to push into a forest where there are no well-worn paths and from which no one has returned to guide us. This is what existentialists call the anxiety of nothingness…. To live into the future means to leap into the unknown, and this requires a degree of courage for which there is no immediate precedent and which few people realize.” He asserts that “if you do not express your own original ideas, if you do not listen to your own being, you will have betrayed yourself. Also you will have betrayed our community in failing to make your contribution to the whole” (pp. 12–13).

   The ten emissaries start their report with a positive statement about the land overflowing with milk and honey; they then switch to the negatively colored description of the fortified cities and powerful people (
   <a href="#num13-27">
    13:27–29
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis describe this as the way slanderers speak: “They begin with flattering and end with evil” (BT
   <i>
    Sotah
   </i>
   35a). Or, in more modern terms: the pessimist observes a situation, generalizes about the bad aspects, and interprets them as a permanent and constant feature. In contrast, the optimist observes the same situation and sees the bad aspects, but particularizes them and interprets them as a temporary obstacle that can be overcome.

   This then is the sin of the scouts: their failure to contribute to their community because of their negative attitude and narrow perspective. They seemingly lack
   <a id="page_889">
   </a>
   the courage to leap into the unknown and confront “no-man’s-land.” Where the ten see potential failure and defeat, Joshua and Caleb see potential success and possibility. They had the courage to leap into the unknown and envision a new reality. While they acknowledge the challenges that lie ahead, they are able to “listen to their own being” and trust in the people’s ability to overcome those challenges with God’s promised help and protection: “The land that we traversed and scouted is an exceedingly good land. If pleased with us,
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   will bring us into that land, a land that flows with milk and honey, and give it to us; only you must not rebel against
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">

   . Have no fear then of the people of the country, for they are our prey: their protection has departed from them, but
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">

   As Harvey Fields wrote, we too can “conquer ‘Promised Lands’ when we have regard for our talents and believe in our creative powers. The sin of the spies grows from their failure of self-love and self-respect…. Only Joshua and Caleb, who refuse to see themselves as ‘grasshoppers,’ are worthy of entering the Promised Land”

   These, to me, are the challenges of
   <i>
    Sh’lach L’cha
   </i>
   : First, the challenge to perceive the world in all its nuanced complexity—and not reduce it to simplistic either/or, black/white categories. Second, and more central to the parashah, the challenge of really loving ourselves and trusting our instincts, the challenge of not making ourselves into anything less than we truly are (since this would diminish the One in whose image we are created), and the challenge of living with the “anxiety of nothingness” in order to create a new reality.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   As long as we see ourselves merely as grasshoppers up against giants, we will set ourselves up for failure. If we want to create anything new and to enter into the Promised Land, then we have no choice but to leap into the unknown, to believe in ourselves, and to trust in God’s faith in us. This voice of optimism and hope is what separates Joshua and Caleb from the other scouts. This is what—in spite of a long history filled with good reasons to see ourselves as grasshoppers and to give up—has enabled the Jewish people to continue and to thrive.

    I remember my mother arising on Fridays while it was still dark to begin the added tasks of preparing for the Sabbath. Dough was kneaded the night before and lay in a large basin which was nestled in the hollow of a huge feather pillow. The pillow kept the dough warm all night so it would rise. A white tablecloth was placed over the basin, and in the morning the dough would look like an enormous mushroom extending over the rim of the basin. My mother would press her fist into the center of the mound, which would collapse in a wrinkled heap. She would continue to knead it for a few minutes, then replace the white tablecloth and allow it to rise once more. After a few hours the tablecloth would again be lifted into a mound; it was then ready to make the Sabbath loaf, or
    <i>
     challah.
    </i>
    While my mother braided the long ropes of dough into a huge oval, I would have a piece of dough to make a miniature
    <i>
     challah.
    </i>
    At first I could only manipulate three strands, braiding them into something like my own braided hair; but then, as I watched my mother working with four strands of dough, I practiced until I could do it too.
   </div>
   <div class="note1">
    Before baking the loaves, which had risen and been glossed over with beaten egg applied with a goose feather, my mother would take a small piece of dough and throw it into the flame of the kitchen range, reciting a special prayer. It was some relic of the old days of sacrifice—some part of an ancient ritual.

    The transforming moment of my life as a Jewish feminist came when I began wearing a
    <i>
     tallit
    </i>
    …. I don’t remember putting the
    <i>
     tallit
    </i>
    on for the first time; it wasn’t a moment I ritualized. I simply became a Jew who prayed in a
    <i>
     tallit,
    </i>
    experiencing my entitlement to its sensuous beauty as part of my obligation to wear this garment. My public and unambiguous violation of normative Judaism was linked to my growing private life as a Jew. My
    <i>

    left me nowhere to hide.

    When I put on a

    even when I am alone, I place myself in the folds of my people. Donning the

     tallit
    </i>
    is a daily, visual symbol of my identity, reminding me to whom I belong as I begin my day’s journey. It protects me, shields me and defines me. Falling around my shoulders and arms, the
    <i>
     tallit
    </i>
    provides me with a secure awareness of my body and its boundaries. I am not lost there, but found. Others are outside, I am inside, but we are one. I fill up my
    <i>
     tallit.
    </i>
    No matter my size, I always will. And it is in that fullness that I am counted as a member of the congregation.
