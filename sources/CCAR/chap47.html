   (“see”) introduces the legal collection that extends from
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu_12.1-16.17">
    Deuteronomy 12
   </a>
   to
   <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_26.1-15">
    26
   </a>
   . Like the two other major biblical collections of legal material (the Book of the Covenant in
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 21–24
   </a>
   and the priestly legislation in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers), these laws are conceived of as part of the covenantal relationship between Israel and God, with responsibilities incumbent upon both parties. The legal collection here offers a unifying vision of Israel: it insists on absolute loyalty to the one God—and to God’s Chosen Place, the sole official shrine.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   According to
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#page_1041">
    Deuteronomy 1:5
   </a>
   , the location for the expounding of these laws is the land of Moab, east of the Jordan River, before Israel enters the land. This would be during the 2nd millennium
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   , according to the implied chronology and the imagined “original” audience (see
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#page_1039">
    introduction to
    <i>
     parashat D’varim
    </i>
   </a>
   ). But historians believe that these laws were actually compiled in the 7th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   or later, and that they comprise part of the “book of the
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   (Teaching),” the phrase used in Deuteronomy to refer to the exhortations and laws in this book (not to the so-called Five Books of Moses). According to II Kings 22 (and II Chronicles 34:14–28), a reportedly similar “book of the
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   ” is discovered during the reign of King Josiah, in the midst of renovations of the Temple. The King orders his scribes to consult with the female prophet Huldah, who authenticates the scroll. Its laws represent a reform of earlier traditions and of existing practice. The book of Kings further reports that King Josiah implemented some of those reforms in about 622
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   (On the economic aspects of this “reform,” see at
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu12-2">
    12:2–3
   </a>
   .)

   The laws in this parashah (like those in the three portions that follow) contain various precepts designed to regulate activity in the Promised Land and to bind Israel to its God. The parashah includes rules about many aspects of life: the consumption of meat (

   While the legislation here applies to all Israel, several teachings at first glance seem to address only the presumably male heads of household (

   ). This raises the following questions: What about their wives, who are not mentioned? Furthermore,
   <a id="page_1116">
   </a>
   are all of these laws intended only for men and not for women? The answers are not always clear. However, some laws implicitly address everyone, such as those that regulate diet (
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#chap-fn3-4">
    14:3–21
   </a>
   ). Others explicitly include women, as when they are expected to attend festive celebrations at Israel’s official sanctuary (

  <div class="tab-enin">
   A powerful theme in
   <i>
    parashat R’eih,
   </i>
   alongside the prominent concern for the loyal worship of Israel’s God alone, is caring for the needy. It is possible that a concern for women’s welfare lies behind certain economic legislation to protect the vulnerable (see at
   <a href="#chap-fn29a-4">
    14:29
   </a>
   ), since women were often at risk in ancient Israelite society.

    Deuteronomy 26

   . Most scholars agree that even though Deuteronomy presents this material as Moses’ teachings, these precepts were compiled hundreds of years later. Evidence indicates that the compilers of the laws in Deuteronomy were an eclectic group—including scribes, priests, prophets, and other intellectuals—who formulated a notion of Israel as a nation guided by God. What makes their work unique is the powerful, unified vision that serves as the basis for their editorial work. Their distinctive perspective includes the idea that all Israel—kings and commoners alike—are to be judged by the degree to which they adhere to the laws of Deuteronomy. In particular, the laws considerably limit the roles of the king and priests and redistribute power to broader segments of the Israelite community (see at
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#deu17-14">
    17:14–20

   The Israelites are charged to destroy places of worship and ritual objects that are sacred to the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land of Canaan, in order to prevent Israel from straying from God. Many modem scholars have concluded that in reality, this regulation targeted village sanctuaries where Israel’s own deity was worshipped. Such sacred sites had been legitimate places of Israelite and Judean worship in the centuries before the centralization mandated in Deuteronomy. (Note, for example, Hannah’s visits to the shrine in Shiloh in I Samuel 1.) Conducting sacrifices only in Jerusalem would have been a boon for that city’s economy, strengthening the crown as it faced Assyrian imperialism, especially in the 7th century

   Archeologists have discovered these objects at sacred sites throughout the land of Israel. Ritual objects like these were earlier used by Canaanites and then adopted by the Israelites, thus indicating the debt they owed to their predecessors in the Promised Land.

   The specific mention of those with least access to resources is an important component of the laws in Deuteronomy.

   <a href="#chap-fn19-2">
    v. 19
   </a>
   , below), a likely result of closing the local sanctuaries that were a major source of livelihood for Levites.

   RULES ABOUT THE CONSUMPTION OF MEAT AND TITHES (12:15–28)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   For Israelites as for others in the ancient world, meat-eating was not part of the daily diet, since they valued animals most for what they could produce while they were alive, including milk, wool, dung (used for fuel and construction), and offspring. Also, meat from an entire animal would have to be consumed at once, given the lack of refrigeration. Thus, eating the meat not otherwise utilized for sacrifice in festive meals provided one way for people to partake of meat.
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-23">
    Exodus 20:21
   </a>
   implies that sacrifices could take place anywhere; however, if centralization of sacrifice meant that there were no longer any local sanctuaries at which to sacrifice animals, then how would those who lived far from Jerusalem be able to eat meat? In order to ensure that the consumption of meat did not cease with the cessation of village sacrifice, Deuteronomy allows Israelites to slaughter and eat meat in their own settlements, as long as they follow these detailed regulations. Deuteronomy’s laws in this case conflict with
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
    Leviticus 17:2–7
   </a>
   , which permits eating meat only at a sanctuary.

    </b>
   </i>
   When animals for human consumption are no longer dedicated to God, everyone can partake of them, not only those who are ritually pure. This regulation makes it easier for women to consume meat because ritual impurity on account of menstruation and childbirth (see
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    Leviticus 12
   </a>
   ;

   Eating blood is prohibited because blood symbolizes life—and life belongs to God (see

   Common among other peoples in the ancient Near East, tithes were a kind of assessment that could be fulfilled by designating agricultural products or livestock, which would be consumed in sacred ceremonies (see also at
   <a href="#deu14-22">
    14:22–29

   The centralization of sacrifice means that the landless Levites (see
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_8.1-9.14">
    Numbers 8
   </a>
   ) who served local sanctuaries would have lost their means of livelihood. In an agrarian culture such as ancient Israel, those who did not own land were at risk of chronic starvation and even death. Therefore, the Levites would have become part of Israel’s underclass, unable to provide for themselves and their families.

   WARNINGS AGAINST WORSHIPPING AS OTHER NATIONS DO (12:29–31)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The crucial injunction condemning the worship of any deity other than Israel’s God is predicated upon the settlement of the land, after God will “cut down” the existing inhabitants. Certain biblical depictions of the conquest of the land (found especially in Joshua and Judges) claim that such destruction happened, whereas other passages portray a long period of Israelite coexistence with Canaanite and other ethnic communities in the very heartland of what would later become the Israel of the Monarchy. The results of decades of archeological research indicate that the latter version is the historically accurate one (see also at
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#deu2-34">

   While child sacrifice is condemned here as an abhorrent religious ritual, other passages reveal that at times even Israelites sacrificed their children (as implied by
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_21.22-22.19">
    Genesis 22:1–19
   </a>
   ). According to II Kings 3:27, the Moabite king sacrifices his first-born son as a last resort. The Israelite child most renowned for having been sacrificed is Jephthah’s daughter (Judges 11:29–40).

   WARNINGS AGAINST ILLICIT MOURNING PRACTICES (14:1–2)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Gashing the skin until it bleeds and shaving were mourning customs practiced by Israelites and some of their neighbors. The other biblical passages that mention gashing or shaving have the connotation of foreignness, even when done by Israelites. For instance, I Kings 18:28 portrays Baal’s prophets mourning their god’s absence in their time of need by gashing themselves (see also Jeremiah 16:6–7; 41:4–5; 47:5). The textual evidence is ambiguous as to whether women as well as men engaged in these public mourning rituals; yet we do know that certain women were trained to chant dirges that accompanied burial ceremonies (see Jeremiah 9:16–17 and

   DIETARY LAWS (14:3–21)

   The dietary laws provide another venue in which Israel must demonstrate its allegiance to God. The regulations found here and in
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_11.1-47">
    Leviticus 11
   </a>
   are straightforward: Israelites may consume only certain specified animals in order to remain within God’s holy community. However, the rationale behind these rules is less transparent. Rabbis, biblical scholars, archeologists, and anthropologists have tried to go beyond the arcane lists of permitted and prohibited animals to understand the purpose for these regulations. While explanations vary, most agree that dietary laws, whatever their origins, were eventually meant to distinguish Israel from other nations and to allow them to demonstrate their loyalty to God. Whether all Israelites were aware of and adhered to the dietary laws is uncertain. However, the absence of pig bones at Israelite sites suggests obedience to at least that rule.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The degree to which dietary rules had an impact on women’s lives is unclear. Both women and men worked in the fields, orchards, and gardens—the source of most Israelite food; and both genders tended livestock, while hunting was done mostly by men. [Food preparation was most often a woman’s task, but the dietary laws do not directly concern that issue. Rather, they concern which animals are permitted and which are forbidden, and they also ban the consumption of blood. The responsibility for draining blood likely fell to those individuals, female or male, who slaughtered animals. Some scholars believe that slaughtering and butchering were men’s tasks; but the narrative of the medium at En-dor reports that she slaughters a calf (I Samuel 28:24), perhaps indicating that both genders would have had responsibility for adhering to the dietary stipulations.—

   The implications and reasons for the injunction against boiling a baby goat in its mother’s milk are obscure. Scholars have not found parallels in other ancient Near Eastern legal material. While some see this as a polemic against a pagan rite, most likely this rule attests to biblical respect for the relationship between a mother and her offspring (see
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#chap-fn6-2">
    22:6–7

   ), as well as revulsion at the idea that mothers’ milk could contribute to death rather than life. [Some contemporary scholars offer a different explanation, arguing that the consonants in the noun
   <i>
    chalav

   (milk) can be read as
   <i>
    chelev

   (fat); in that case, the verse would forbid cooking a young animal in “its mother’s fat.” This prohibition would avoid the economic loss involved in slaughtering two animals, one of whom could still bear more young. (See Carol Meyers’ discussion of Jack Sasson’s research in

In Deuteronomy the injunction applies to the entire household, women and men alike, who are to rejoice together in God’s presence as they consume these tithes at the central sanctuary. (See also

Because of the six-year limit on the term of servitude, the Hebrew debt-servant is in a position different from that of the foreigner taken as a prisoner of war or purchased from a foreign owner and kept as a slave for life.

   The final command, to celebrate the three major feasts in the Chosen Place, underscores gender inequality in Israelite community festivals. Each feast requires the offering of a gift, which reflects the blessing that God has bestowed upon the individual making the offering. Who is required to appear before God and bring a gift reflecting God’s blessing? “All your males” (
   <a href="#chap-fn16-6">
    v. 16
   </a>
   ) are the ones who must see God’s “face.” [What this rule is meant to convey about females is not clear, especially given that
   <a href="#page_1120">
    12:12
   </a>
   and other passages expect women to be present during festival celebrations as well. Assessing the relationship between obligations and exemptions is difficult. (See also

    N IMPORTANT ISSUE
   </small>
   in this parashah is the centralization of religious life at the one chosen sanctuary. Yet the wording of several instructions raises at least two questions about the inclusion of women.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   First, daughters and female slaves are commanded to celebrate two of the pilgrimage festivals—Shavuot (
   <a href="#chap-fn11-6">
    16:11
   </a>
   ) and Sukkot (
   <a href="#chap-fn14-6">
    16:14
   </a>
   ), but not Passover (
   <a href="#deu16-5">
    16:5–8
   </a>
   )—along with marginal individuals like widows and orphans. (See also
   <a href="#page_1120">
    12:12
   </a>
   .) But why are wives not mentioned? The command addressed to the head of household apparently includes the man’s wife as the senior female of the household; the head of the household, when male, thus stands for both members of the conjugal pair (see also
   <i>
    Mishpatim,
   </i>
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#page_445">
    Another View
   </a>
   ). This implicit inclusion of the wife perhaps authorizes her to act on behalf of her husband should he be unable for any reason to make the pilgrimage trip. In fact, listing her separately would have precluded her status as “second-in-command.”
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The summary of the stipulations for the three pilgrim festivals presents a second problem, for it specifies that “all your males” shall come to the Chosen Place (
   <a href="#chap-fn16-6">
    16:16
   </a>
   ). Why are women not mentioned? Some have suggested that Deuteronomy exempts women because the journey might be too difficult for them, especially those with young children. But another possibility acknowledges that agrarian households included animals that could not be left untended for close to two weeks (the weeklong holiday plus travel time). As the chief household managers (see Proverbs 31:10–31), women were the natural ones to maintain the household at such times. Thus, the all-inclusive injunction for everyone to participate in the Sukkot festival every seventh year that is found elsewhere in
   <a href="55_chapter_52.xhtml#de33_23-1">
    Deuteronomy (31:10–12)
   </a>
   may be idealistic. Alternatively, the insistence on women’s participation on that occasion may emphasize that they too should experience the special covenant renewal of the seventh-year celebration.

   Twenty-first-century expectations for gender equality in the Torah are unrealistic. Because Israelite society was organized by lineage units, Deuteronomy addresses many of its instructions to the heads of households (usually male), who bear the main responsibility for fulfilling the Torah’s cultic requirements. Yet, although women often are not addressed explicitly in the pilgrimage regulations, they are not forbidden to participate; in fact, several texts indicate their presence. In this respect, the festival commands of Deuteronomy seem more inclusive than comparable rules in Exodus (compare
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e23-15">
    Exodus 23:14–17
   </a>
   ).

   (
   <a href="#deu12-7">
    12:7
   </a>
   ). The use of the phrase “your households” (literally “your houses”) immediately raises questions about who is included in this designation. Subsequent verses in this parashah (
   <a href="#page_1120">
    12:12

   ,
   <a href="#deu12-18">

   ) consistently omit wives from lists of participating household members, but they do
   <a id="page_1135">
   </a>
   include other women, such as daughters and female slaves. Thus, early rabbinic interpreters considered the expression for “house” here to mean “wife” (
   <i>
    Sifrei D’varim
   </i>
   64); in fact, rabbinic texts often equate the two terms (Mishnah
   <i>
    Yoma
   </i>
   1:1). Rabbinic sources frequently cite a statement to this effect attributed to Rabbi Yosi, who said, “All my life I never called my wife ‘my wife’
   <i>
    (ishti)
   </i>
   and my ox ‘my ox.’ Instead, my wife I called ‘my house’ and my ox ‘my field’” (BT
   <i>
    Shabbat
   </i>
   118b; BT
   <i>
    Gittin
   </i>
   52a, among others). Indeed, in talmudic Aramaic one of the words for “wife” is related to the word for “house.” Thus, the Rabbis understood a wife to be the essence of a household, and they attached a great deal of significance to this fundamental conviction.

   The metaphoric connection between woman and house in the rabbinic imagination led to further elaborations, such as references to the interior organs of the woman’s body as various rooms. For example, “the sages made a simile (
   <i>
    mashal mash’lu)
   </i>
   with regard to the woman: the chamber, the antechamber, and the upper chamber” (Mishnah
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   2:5). At times, women’s sexual organs are referred to as doors, hinges, and even keys (BT
   <i>
    B’chorot

   45a).

   ). The repeated biblical insistence that the first-born be consecrated led to an entire mishnaic tractate,
   <i>
    B’chorot,
   </i>
   which is devoted to the legal aspects of this topic. Among many other concerns, Mishnah
   <i>
    B’chorot
   </i>
   inquires as to what constitutes the status of a first-born animal. Does this include, for instance, an animal that emerged from “its mother’s side,” presumably by Caesarean birth? The answer is that such a birth does not bestow first-born status on the animal since
   <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#n18-16">
    Numbers 18:15
   </a>
   defines the first-born as literally what “opens the womb.” Moreover, biblical law explicitly requires a “male” first-born. Thus, any sexual ambiguity, whether a lack or a doubling of external sexual organs, constitutes a blemish that disqualifies an animal from sacrificial status as a first-born (Mishnah
   <i>
    B’chorot
   </i>
   6:12).

    </b>
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#chap-fn14-6">
    16:14
   </a>
   ). According to the Babylonian Talmud, this verse teaches that a husband is obligated to make his wife and children rejoice as part of the holiday observance. A Babylonian sage suggests that wives are made joyous with new clothes; he goes on to claim that in Babylonia women prefer colorful garments, while women in the Land of Israel prefer bleached clothes made from linen (BT
   <i>
    P’sachim
   </i>
   109a). Another rabbinic tradition based on this verse prohibits weddings during the intermediary days of Passover or Sukkot, since “one should not mix up one joy with another” (BT
   <i>
    Mo’ed Katan
   </i>
   8b).

   </span>
   (
   <a href="#chap-fn16-6">
    16:16
   </a>
   ). The emphasis on “males” in the concluding verses of the parashah is noteworthy, especially since earlier statements imply that the entire extended household, including daughters and female slaves, was obligated to participate in festival observances. The exclusion of women in this verse appears to contradict the preceding passages. The Rabbis solved this contradiction by subdividing the responsibilities of rejoicing (v. 14) into various components. Accordingly, women and people with sexual ambiguities, such as the hermaphrodite and the non-sexed person, are said to be exempt from the commandment of appearing before God (Mishnah
   <i>
    Chagigah
   </i>
   1:1), since the biblical verse specifies that males are to do this. “Appearance” (
   <i>
    r’iah
   </i>
   ) entails both presence in the Temple and offering a sacrifice, since “they shall not appear before
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   empty-handed” (
   <a href="#chap-fn16-6">
    16:16
   </a>
   ). Talmudic discussions (BT
   <i>
    Chagigah
   </i>
   4b) suggest that the exemption of women from this particular obligation makes sense since bringing a sacrifice in this instance is a time-bound commandment (festival observances take place three times a year on specific days
   <a id="page_1136">
   </a>
   on the calendar). According to an early rabbinic principle, women are exempt from commandments that must be performed at fixed times (Mishnah
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   1:7). However, the responsibility to rejoice applies to everyone (Tosefta
   <i>
    Chagigah
   </i>
   1:4 and BT
   <i>
    Chagigah
   </i>
   6b); thus, in that aspect of the festival celebration, women and men are equally obligated.

   “Y
   <small>
    OU ARE WHAT YOU EAT,”
   </small>
   the common expression goes. I sometimes think of this saying in relation to kashrut (that is, keeping kosher). What do the choices that we make about what we eat reveal about who we really are? Many Jews today view kashrut as an outdated vestige of ancient Israelite practice, expanded upon by rabbinic Judaism, but no longer relevant to modern day life. However, the presentation of the prohibitions associated with kashrut in
   <i>
    parashat R’eih
   </i>
   challenges us to consider anew the purposes of kashrut.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu14">
    Deuteronomy 14
   </a>
   tells us what animals, fish, and birds we can and cannot eat. It instructs us not to boil a kid (a young goat) in its mother’s milk, an injunction that became the basis for the rabbinic separation between milk and meat (
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#chap-fn21-4">
    14:21
   </a>
   ; see also
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e23-19">
    Exodus 23:19
   </a>
   and
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#levisa8">
    34:26
   </a>
   ). While many Jews today believe the biblical prohibitions against certain meat and fish to be for health reasons,
   <i>
    parashat R’eih
   </i>
   makes no such claim. In fact, if this were the case, the explicit permission to give the stranger and the foreigner the foods we are forbidden to eat (
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#chap-fn21-4">
    14:21
   </a>
   ) would be frankly immoral. Rather,
   <i>
    parashat R’eih,
   </i>
   as the Torah does elsewhere, identifies the articulation of eating prohibitions strictly as part of the Israelites’ particular path to holiness: “for you are a people consecrated to your God
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="ltr">
    יהוה
   </span>
   ” (
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#chap-fn21-4">
    14:21
   </a>
   ). What is it about these prohibitions that can make us holy? Interestingly, the prohibited foods are identified as
   <i>
    tamei…lachem
   </i>
   —ritually impure “for you” (
   <a href="#deu14-7">
    14:7
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#deu14-7">
    8
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#chap-fn9-4">
    10
   </a>
   ). For this reason, it is perfectly acceptable for other people to eat them, just not for the people Israel.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Traditional and modern commentators have offered various explanations as to why particular fish, poultry, and animals are considered
   <i>
    tahor
   </i>
   (“ritually pure”) and therefore acceptable to eat. But perhaps more important than the meaning of each of the details of the prohibitions is the simple fact that we are given a list of dos and don’ts that govern what we are to consume daily. According to the Torah, God asks that we abstain from eating certain foods, not because they are unhealthy or intrinsically problematic, but simply as an expression of our devotion. As with other
   <i>
    chukim
   </i>
   (laws that the rabbinic sages define as being without rational explanation), these prohibitions are like the requests of a beloved: we may not understand them, but we are, in essence, asked to follow them purely as an expression of our love. Daily, the observance of kashrut calls us back to a personal relationship with God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The laws of kashrut offer a Jewish spiritual discipline that is rooted in the concrete choices and details of daily life—to be practiced in an area that seems most “mundane.” In fact, part of the beauty of kashrut is that regardless of our age, personal interests, or geographic location, we all eat, and most of us do so several times a day. While we may sometimes choose to dine alone, eating is almost universally enjoyed as a social activity. A spiritual discipline around eating is one that carries the clear message that spirituality is about far more than what we do in synagogue and on
   <a id="page_1137">
   </a>
   holidays; it extends into every area of our lives, every single day.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Kashrut reminds us again and again that Jewish spirituality is inseparable from what one might term “physical.” It teaches us that Jewish spiritual practice is about taking the most ordinary of experiences—in all aspects of our lives—and transforming them into moments of meaning, moments of connection. Kashrut provides a model for doing just that, around issues of food preparation and eating. It’s time to cook dinner: What will we make, and how will we prepare it? Will we be driven by an empty stomach or considerations that extend beyond it as well? In these moments, kashrut can connect us to Jewish tradition, to other Jews, and to God. We are hungry and sit down for a meal, but before digging in, we recall that Jewish tradition offers us the practice of pausing for a blessing and a moment of gratitude. We may take this a step further and decide to put aside
   <i>
    tzedakah
   </i>
   regularly at dinnertime, as some of us try to do. This can be seen as a practice similar to the tithing performed in ancient times, as outlined in the verses immediately following the rules of kashrut in our parashah (
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu14-22">
    14:22–29
   </a>
   ). In stead of just wolfing down our food and moving on to the next activity, we can learn from Jewish rituals to pause and turn the act of eating into a moment of heightened spiritual awareness.

  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Increasing numbers of Jews today are expanding their kashrut practice to incorporate additional ethical and environmental considerations. Was the food produced under conditions that respect persons and the environment? Were the workers who picked or prepared the food paid a living wage? Did the processes of production treat animals humanely? In addition to allowing these questions to influence our choices about what to eat, we can direct our
   <i>
    tzedakah
   </i>
   money to organizations that address these issues, like environmental and farmworker advocacy groups.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   From the time of the Torah onward, Jewish tradition teaches us that the spiritual realm encompasses all of life. Kashrut and the other Jewish practices related to eating exemplify this teaching and extend beyond themselves: they stand as daily reminders to look for additional ways to turn the ordinary into moments of deeper connection and intentionality. Every moment has the potential to be one of connection. Through other
   <i>
    mitzvot,
   </i>
   such as the laws governing proper speech and interpersonal ethics, as well as through the less well-known but rich Jewish tradition of cultivating
   <i>
    middot
   </i>
   (personal qualities such as patience and generosity in judgment), we can seek to deepen our connections with each other and with God. A Jewish spiritual discipline around eating, practiced with intention, can set us on this course every day. “You are what you eat.” That is, what you choose to eat and how you choose to eat it says a lot about who you are and what kind of a life you are striving to achieve.

    “You’ll sit there until you finish your meal,” we say to the child who refuses to eat, without in the least realizing how potently we engage in this way a heated debate about identity.…Food is so charged, so significant, so informed with primal meaning and first impressions of life, mothering, and the world that we might well expect the communications that take place through food to carry even more weight than those that arise when a child totters about knocking into furniture or pushes a truck across the floor.
   </div>
   <div class="tab-enin">
    And so we come, stage by stage in this way, to adolescence, when the youth must struggle to form an image of what she is and may become. Is it a wonder, then, that she continues to express this struggle through her relationship to food?

    If Pesach is about departures (for it recalls the Exodus from Egypt) and Shavuot is about arrivals (for it celebrates the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai), Sukkot is about the journey. It is the holiday that best symbolizes where most of us are most of the time: somewhere in between, midway, sometimes moving, sometimes stuck, always heading—we hope—in the right direction. It reminds us that the way to get somewhere, what we do and learn along the way, where we detour and where we pause, whom we meet and whom we travel with, are as essential to the journey as is the arrival.
