   (“I pleaded”) begins with Moses’ recollection of how he longingly prayed to God to be allowed to enter the Promised Land. This speech is part of a larger address to the Israelites in which Moses recounts for them all that occurred in the wilderness and the lessons they should derive from these experiences. Moses exhorts them to use the past as the basis for future behavior, making their first-hand knowledge of God and their national memory of the Sinai experience (here called Horeb) the basis for their relationship to God when they begin their lives in the new land without him.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Throughout this parashah, Moses plays the role of teacher. First, he spells out various reasons as to
   <i>
    why
   </i>
   the Israelites should obey God’s teachings (
   <a href="#deu_4.1-40">
    4:1–40
   </a>
   ). Next, he reminds them of
   <i>
    what
   </i>
   God commanded at Horeb (Sinai) (
   <a href="#deu_4.44-5.30">
    4:44
   </a>
   –
   <a href="#deu5-30">
    5:30
   </a>
   ), including the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”) (
   <a href="#page_1073">
    5:6–18
   </a>
   ). Then, he teaches them
   <i>
    how
   </i>
   to fulfill the commandments by specifying the proper attitude to approach the Divine (
   <a href="#deu_6.1-7.5">
    6:1–7:5
   </a>
   ). Finally, he concludes by explaining the nature of God’s love for them, the basis for the relationship between Israel and God (
   <a href="#deu_7.6-11">
    7:6–11
   </a>
   ). Throughout, Moses reiterates that while the people will be rewarded for their obedience and commitment to God, they will be punished severely if they stray from God’s path. In particular, he emphasizes monotheism, a central theme in Deuteronomy as a whole. God’s uniqueness and the demand for Israel’s absolute loyalty find expression in the passages known as the
   <i>
    Sh’ma
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    V’ahavta
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#chap-fn4-4">
    6:4–9
   </a>
   )— prayers that stand at the center of the Jewish proclamation of faith.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This parashah seems to include women as a matter of course when Moses addresses the Israelites in the second-person masculine singular or plural, as is typical elsewhere. In addition, women are mentioned specifically in the Decalogue as daughters, slaves, mothers, and wives (
   <a href="#deu5-14">
    5:14
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#chap-fn16-3">
    16
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#page_1075">
    18
   </a>
   ), as well as in the prohibition of intermarriage, in which Canaanite women appear to possess the power to lead Israelites astray (
   <a href="#chap-fn3-4a">
    7:3–4
   </a>
   ). More indirectly, the parashah’s emphasis on education (
   <a href="#deu6-20">
    6:20–25
   </a>
   ) invites readers to assess women’s role in ancient Israel with respect to raising the next generation.

   his unit continues Moses’ review of the Israelites’ journey to the plains of Moab, in the lower Jordan valley. In preparing the people to enter the land, Moses explains why he cannot go forth with them. Earlier he blamed the people for his not being allowed to enter the land (
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#chap-fn37-1">
    1:37
   </a>
   ); here he discloses how he unsuccessfully beseeched God to reconsider.

   There is a word play between this word and
   <i>
    eb’rah-na,
   </i>
   “let me cross over” in the previous verse. The root
   <i>
    e-b-r
   </i>
   is repeated numerous times in the previous parashah (for example,
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#chap-fn14-4">
    2:14
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#deu_3.21-22">
    3:21
   </a>
   ), highlighting the theme of “crossing over” at the beginning of Deuteronomy.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Moses again blames the Israelites for his punishment, as in
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#chap-fn37-1">
    1:37
   </a>
   . In contrast,
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_20.1-29">
    Numbers 20
   </a>
   (where Moses strikes the rock to produce water) depicts the punishment as Moses’ fault. This inconsistency exemplifies one of several contradictions between Deuteronomy’s account of the wilderness journey and that of Exodus and Numbers (see at
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#n1-9">
    1:9–18
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#n1-19">
    1:19–46
   </a>
   ). While Moses interprets God’s response and behavior as anger (see also
   <a href="#deu4-21">
    4:21
   </a>
   ), one might also see a nurturing hand in God’s allowing Moses to see the land and assuring him of an integral role in passing on leadership to Joshua.

   oses’ speeches at the start of Deuteronomy retell—and reinterpret—the formative events in Israel’s journey as a way of exhorting his audience to obey the instructions. He argues that God’s teachings must be followed strictly since there are dire consequences for disobeying them. At the same time, he emphasizes that these precepts should be obeyed because they provide Israel wisdom and discernment that will make this nation honored by other nations. Moses uses a combination of threats and promises to stress the need to follow these teachings even when he is no longer present as an intermediary and interpreter.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Here, as elsewhere, Deuteronomy speaks to multiple audiences: those who are described in the text as standing in Moab listening to Moses’ words; the contemporaries of the exilic writers who composed the literary framework of the book (

   One way that Moses teaches the importance of obeying God’s commandments is by emphasizing the lessons learned from personal experience. Here, he calls attention to what the people saw with their “own eyes” (

   As part of his warning against idolatry, Moses forbids the worship of the celestial bodies. The passage states that God divided the heavenly beings among the other nations but selected Israel as God’s own possession. In other words, God sanctioned the non-Israelites to worship lesser divine entities but restricted the Israelites to worship God alone.

   Demanding absolute loyalty to the one God, Moses warns the Israelites that if they make idols they will be exiled from the land they currently wait to enter. According to some who date much of Deuteronomy to the 7th century
   <small>
    B.C.E
   </small>
   ., this passage addresses an audience in Judah that fears imminent exile, having witnessed the exile of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   Others who date
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_4.1-40">
    Deuteronomy 4
   </a>
   even later, to the Babylonian exile, see this warning as an explanation after the fact, indicating why exile happened and offering comfort that restoration is possible.

   According to translator David Stein, this term can have either a male-only or an inclusive sense, depending on context. He argues that here the term refers specifically to the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), those with whom God formed a covenant in their capacity as (male) heads of their corporate households. It goes without saying that each patriarch represents the entire household, and that God’s covenant applies to all its members—women and men alike (“Methodology,”

   Starting with a series of rhetorical questions, this passage illustrates the uniqueness of God’s relationship with Israel—perhaps the most important reason for observing God’s laws—by retelling a sequence of spectacular and seemingly impossible events, including the redemption from Egypt and revelation of God’s words.

   This verse and

   clearly and directly affirm the monotheistic belief in a single deity. In contrast, other passages in Deuteronomy reflect an acceptance that other gods existed, even though Israel was commanded to worship the one God exclusively; scholars refer to this belief as monolatry (see

   As Moses expresses the importance of studying and observing the terms of God’s teaching (see also
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_4.1-40">
    4:1

   Even though Moses is the only one who speaks with God “face to face” (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e33-7">
    Exodus 33:11
   </a>
   ; compare “mouth to mouth” in
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-2">
    Numbers 12:8

   THE DECALOGUE (“TEN COMMANDMENTS”) (5:6–18)

   <a href="#chap-fn16-3">
    vv. 16–18
   </a>
   deal solely with issues protecting the family. The commandments refer to women repeatedly, making it clear that these laws are considered an obligation for all Israel. For more on the (non) gendered language in the Decalogue and details concerning the structure of these commandments and their ancient Near East context, see at

   This verse, which is a statement and not a command per se, establishes the reason why the Israelites should observe God’s laws. While some consider the historical prologue in this verse to be the first “commandment,” others interpret both

   Jeffrey Tigay explains that in the Bible the root
   <i>
    k-n-a,
   </i>
   meaning “to become dark red,” is often associated with fire (as in
   <a href="#deu4-24">
    4:24
   </a>
   ) and is used to describe “fiery passions” like love, anger, and jealousy. He writes: “The term reflects the emotional tie between God and Israel that was described metaphorically by the prophets as a marital bond in which [God] is like the husband and Israel a wife” (
   <i>
    Deuteronomy
   </i>
   , 1996, p. 65). This metaphor captures the expected exclusive nature of the relationship between God and Israel, as well as the jealousy and anger sparked when Israel unfaithfully turns to other gods (see also at

   This commandment is explained differently here than in
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-8">
    Exodus 20:8–11
   </a>
   . Exodus exhorts the Israelites to “remember” the Sabbath, while Deuteronomy commands the Israelites to “observe” the Sabbath. Exodus focuses on God’s resting on the seventh day of creation as the reason for the observance, whereas Deuteronomy connects it to God’s saving of the Israelites from Egypt. Exodus explains how the Sabbath came to be: it portrays God and Moses as proclaiming to newly liberated Israelites that they, like God, must rest on the Sabbath. Deuteronomy, addressed ostensibly to a generation of wilderness-born Israelites who have not experienced slavery, commands them to observe the Sabbath for the sake of their own slaves, lest they forget the historical experiences of their ancestors. [These differences have ramifications for how one understands the Torah as a continuous tradition. The revision reflected in Deuteronomy underscores the fluidity of even the Decalogue, as precepts are revised or reapplied for the circumstances of a new generation. (See further

   The commandment to honor one’s parents comes at the center of the Decalogue, and it is one of the few that promises a reward (see also
   <a href="#deu5-10">
    v. 10
   </a>
   ). This commandment reflects the need to preserve the family structure across generations in order to have a viable community; it helps to maintain parental authority and to ensure for the care of elderly parents. (See also at
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo20-14">

   This is one of several biblical texts that emphasize the mother’s importance (see also at
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#page_704">
    Leviticus 19:3
   </a>
   and at
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#e11-12">
    Numbers 11:12
   </a>
   ). For instance, Genesis emphasizes a mother’s role in the family structure (see Rebekah in
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_27.1-28.9">
    Genesis 27–28
   </a>
   ); Proverbs 1:8 and 6:20 exhort children to be faithful to their mother’s teachings.

   In the Bible, adultery is defined as sex between a man and a married woman who is not his wife (see also at
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu22-22">
    22:22
   </a>
   and
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-13">

   </i>
   While this verse has been applied to lying in general, it refers here only to the act of lying as a witness in a legal situation. This prohibition does not apply to many cases in which biblical characters, including women, use deception to subvert those in power and to achieve what, from the biblical perspective, can be considered legitimate ends (as does Rebekah in
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_27.1-28.9">
    Genesis 27
   </a>
   ; see also Abraham at
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.10-14.24">

      You [men] shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The Decalogue ends with another directive to protect the family. The term “covet” implies a more inward emotion. While many have questioned how an emotion can be legislated, others point out that some thoughts can be harmful; thus it is in a person’s best interest to attempt to control ideas in their seedling states. This is one of the places where a commandment implicitly applies only to men; the reverse, a woman coveting her neighbor’s husband, may also be implicit but unacknowledged. (For a different interpretation, see at
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-14">
    Exodus 20:14

   In
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_20.1-14">
    Exodus 20:14
   </a>
   , the order of the words in this commandment is different; there, the mention of a neighbor’s house precedes the mention of his wife. Each version of the Decalogue thus evokes a different meaning of Heb.
   <i>
    bayit
   </i>
   (“household, house”). In effect, Exodus counts a wife as an element of the household, while Deuteronomy treats her apart from the household’s assets.

   THE CALL TO LOVE THE ONE AND ONLY GOD (6:1–9)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This section includes two central passages in Jewish liturgy: the
   <i>
    Sh’ma
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#chap-fn4-4">
    6:4
   </a>
   ) and
   <i>
    V’ahavta
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#chap-fn4-4">
    6:4–9
   </a>
   ). The
   <i>
    Sh’ma
   </i>
   (“Hear”) reminds the Israelites of God’s essence and their relationship with the One God. The
   <i>
    V’ahavta
   </i>
   (“You shall love”) describes how the people are to internalize the teachings and impart them to future generations.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The
   <i>
    Sh’ma
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    V’ahavta
   </i>
   hold special meaning when understood as directives to the Israelites about to cross the Jordan into Israel. At a time so central to the formation of the people, they are told about love and the importance of preserving family, educating one’s children, and maintaining one’s relationship to the Divine. These ideas have helped to sustain the people Israel throughout many years of waiting to “cross the Jordan.”

   </i>
   This charge refers to both listening and obeying, with alliteration linking the two words (
   <i>
    v’shamata
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    v’shamarta).

    </b>
   </i>
   Given the centrality of the
   <i>
    Sh’ma
   </i>
   as the “watchword of the Jewish faith,” its meaning is surprisingly uncertain. Because of its grammatical construction and the various nuances of the word
   <i>
    echad
   </i>
   (translated here as “alone”), this declaration can be construed in different ways. Some translations have rendered it as: “The L
   <small>
    ORD
   </small>
   our God, the L
   <small>
    ORD
   </small>
   is one” (see the 1917 Jewish Publication Society translation, which is similar to the 1611 King James Version). Such a translation implies that the
   <i>
    Sh’ma
   </i>
   is a statement about God’s essence, a reflection of the monotheistic belief in the existence of only one God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Other translations resemble the one incorporated in this book. This version makes a claim about God’s unique relationship to Israel, without necessarily denying the existence of other divine beings. Bernard Levinson points out: “The verse makes not a quantitative argument (about the number of deities) but a qualitative one about the nature of the relationship between God and Israel” (“Deuteronomy,
   <i>
    ” Jewish Study Bible,
   </i>
   2004, p. 380). This understanding reflects what many scholars have concluded is a pre-monotheistic Israelite belief called monolatry: the allegiance to one god, while recognizing the existence of other deities. (See also at

   . This language is rooted in ancient Near Eastern political treaties, where “love” implies a sense of loyalty to a greater power. The verb conveys not just an emotion, but a statement with implications for one’s actions. God demands intellectual, emotional, and physical commitment. (See also at

   In the ancient Near East, sacred words were literally written on doorposts and on plaques placed near entranceways; this practice had an apotropaic function, meaning that it was believed to help ward off evil. This evolved into the Jewish practice of writing selections from the Torah on a piece of parchment and affixing it to the doorpost, usually encased in a slender box (called a mezuzah).

   Remembering what God has done in the past is a starting point and guide to the future. Memory plays a crucial role in Deuteronomy as a whole and in this parashah in particular.

   PROHIBITIONS REGARDING THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND (7:1–5)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The call to absolute loyalty to God and the memory of the past become the basis for the demand for complete separation from Israel’s neighbors. Many later readers have struggled with the problematic concept that God charges the Israelites to destroy all the inhabitants when they enter the land. We must confront the fact that this is what the Torah says and be willing to disapprove of it. While we may attempt to understand this rhetoric in its historical context, we can still reject it as something we would not endorse today. In this parashah, the demand to destroy all the Canaanites is presented within a specific understanding of who Israel is at this point in its history: because the Israelites are weak and have demonstrated their inability to resist foreign worship in the past, they are instructed to isolate themselves in order to maintain their identity and remain loyal to their God. (See also at
   <a href="49_chapter_46.xhtml#deu7-24">
    7:24

   .) [Some scholars make the point that such calls for destruction most likely reflect the retrojected rhetoric of victory, a claim by later generations that the previous inhabitants were annihilated completely. However, had all the seven nations listed in v. 1 been destroyed, then the command not to intermarry (v. 3) would be irrelevant (see also
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e23-32">
    Exodus 23:32–33
   </a>
   and
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
    34:15–16

   , which imply the existence of other inhabitants of the land). While conquest certainly involves killing, Deuteronomy’s representation of the wholesale slaughter of every living person (the proclamation of
   <i>

   ) is unlikely to have been a historical actuality. —

   his is one of the Bible’s strongest statements of God’s special relationship with Israel. God has actively chosen this people and separated them from all others to be God’s people.

   in debates about the development of monotheism, the belief in God’s oneness. While certain passages reflect Deuteronomy’s mandate that a single God must be worshipped at one shrine by one people (see
   <a href="#deu4-35">
    4:35
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="#chap-fn4-4">
    6:4
   </a>
   ), others suggest a belief in the existence in multiple deities (see
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E4-20">
    4:19–20
   </a>
   ). Despite the Bible’s claim that Moses introduced monotheism to the world, many scholars recognize that Israel’s commitment to monotheism developed over time. Texts such as
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E4-20">
    4:19–20
   </a>
   or
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e15-11">
    Exodus 15:11
   </a>
   (“Who is like you,
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   , among the celestials [literally: gods]?”) likely represent an earlier stage in Israel’s theological development. Furthermore, prophetic diatribes against idolatry (see, for instance, Jeremiah 2 or Hosea 2) suggest that monotheism may have been the ideal, but it may not have been the practice of the average Israelite until the 6th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Tikva Frymer-Kensky shed enormous light on the process through which monotheism took root within Israelite culture and thus revolutionized biblical religion. In her influential 1992 book
   <i>
    In the Wake of the Goddesses,
   </i>
   she described the transition to monotheism as a process in which the image of Israel’s God expanded to include all the functions previously attributed to various gods and goddesses—the multiple divine personalities thought to determine the natural world. Israel’s God became the rainmaker, healer, warrior, and, as the many tales of barren women attest, controller of human reproduction.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   However, this perception of one God as master of the universe creates a theological challenge. The polytheistic universe, observed Frymer-Kensky, is defined by change and flux in which humanity is at the mercy of the gods. Divine whims destroy cities; divine squabbles cause deluge or drought. Now, with one God in control, what accounts for destruction and tragedy? Frymer-Kensky asserted that biblical monotheism makes human beings the initiators of change within the universe. Human behavior becomes the variable that determines the course of history and the natural world. When Israel behaves, there is rain and abundance; when Israel sins, there is drought and death (
   <a href="49_chapter_46.xhtml#deu11-13">
    Deuteronomy 11:13–17
   </a>
   ). Frymer-Kensky noted that biblical monotheism thus comes with a mandate: as God’s partners, it becomes humanity’s responsibility to maintain God’s universe through right behavior and social justice.

   <i>
    D’varim Rabbah

   2.1 poses four rhetorical questions on the halachah of prayer. For the answers, it looks to the behavior of four biblical figures—Hannah, Daniel, David, and Solomon. The first question is whether a person should pray in a loud voice, as Moses apparently does in this passage. Based on the actions of Hannah, who prayed silently, with only her lips moving (I Samuel 1:13), the answer is no.

   (
   <a href="#chap-fn16-3">
    5:16
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis (JT
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   1:7, 61b) illustrated this commandment with two exaggerated tales designed to emphasize the seriousness of the mitzvah. Rabbi Tarfon’s mother was walking in her courtyard on Shabbat when her shoe broke, exposing her foot to the ground. Her son placed his hands under her feet step by step until she returned to her room. When she later complained to other Rabbis that her son had shown her too much honor, they disagreed. Even if he repeated that act thousands of times, he would still not have shown her even half the honor the Torah requires. Conversely, Rabbi Ishmael’s mother complained to the Rabbis that her son did not honor her sufficiently when he refused to allow her to wash his feet and drink the wash water. The Rabbis insisted that if this was the honor she desired, then he must allow her to do it.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   At BT
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   39b, the Rabbis compared the mitzvah of honoring parents with the commandment in
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#chap-fn6-2">
    Deuteronomy 22:6–7
   </a>
   to send away a mother bird before gathering up her eggs. In each case, the Torah promises long life to those who keep these mitzvot. And the comparison goes deeper: by sending away the mother bird, the egg gatherer shows sensitivity to a mother, albeit a non-human one. Broadly speaking, sending away the mother bird is “honoring a mother,” or honoring motherhood.

   (
   <a href="#chap-fn4-4">
    6:4–9

   ). The Rabbis saw the recitation of the
   <i>
    Sh’ma
   </i>
   as a Jew’s acceptance of the “yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven”—that is, the acceptance of God’s sovereignty, including acceptance of God’s legitimate authority to require obedience to the Torah (for instance, Mishnah
   <i>
    B’rachot
   </i>
   2:2, 5). The martyr Rabbi Akiva died while saying these words (BT
   <i>
    B’rachot
   </i>
   61b). This entire passage, known as “recitation of the
   <i>
    Sh’ma,”
   </i>
   became part of the standard prayer liturgy that men are required to recite twice daily. However, the Rabbis ruled that women are not required to recite the daily
   <i>
    Sh’ma
   </i>
   (Mishnah
   <i>
    B’rachot
   </i>
   3:3) since it is a positive, time-bound commandment from which women are generally exempt in rabbinic law (BT
   <i>
    B’rachot
   </i>
   20b). The Talmud raises the possibility that women should also be obligated in the recitation of
   <i>
    Sh’ma
   </i>
   because of its proclamation of God’s sovereignty, but then dismisses this option. The insistence on women’s exemption from time-bound commandments, even in the service of God, is a powerful talmudic statement of gender hierarchy and female spiritual marginalization. As Rabbi David Abudraham (14th-century Spain) explained, women are exempt from time-bound commandments so that they will not be occupied in divine service when their husbands need them for domestic service.

    </b>
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#chap-fn3-4a">
    7:3–4
   </a>
   ). The Torah forbids intermarriage with the seven Canaanite nations on the grounds that the Canaanite spouse could turn the Israelite spouse away from the worship of God. In their biblical context, these verses
   <a id="page_1084">
   </a>
   depict an equal-opportunity danger: whether the intermarrying Israelite is the bride or the groom, the fear is that the Canaanite spouse will lead the Israelite partner astray. Partly because the Canaanite concern was nonexistent in their time, and partly because rabbinic legal interpretation of Scripture generally tends to focus closely on words and phrases, the Rabbis read the grammatically masculine Hebrew of 7:4 with extreme literalness: “For
   <i>
    he
   </i>
   will turn
   <i>
    your son
   </i>
   away.” In the Talmud this reading is used to justify the determination of Jewish descent according to whether one’s mother is Jewish (BT
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   68b). The argument is that “he” (the Israelite daughter’s Canaanite spouse) will turn away “your son” (the Israelite father-in-law’s grandson from that union). This proves that the child of a Canaanite father and Israelite mother is considered “your son” (an Israelite), while the child of an Israelite father and Canaanite mother is, by implication, considered “her child” (a Canaanite). Thus, according to rabbinic halachah, in cases of intermarriage the children of an Israelite mother married to a non-Jew are considered part of the Jewish people, but the children of an Israelite father and a non-Israelite mother are not.

   of the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”) described in this portion has long been scrutinized for how it differs from the first version in
   <i>
    parashat Yitro.
   </i>
   One obvious difference is the reason given for observing the Sabbath.
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-8">
    Exodus 20:11
   </a>
   states that we should rest on the seventh day in imitation of God at Creation, but
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu5-13">
    Deuteronomy 5:15
   </a>
   focuses on our need as humans to rest. Another discrepancy is that
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    Exodus 19
   </a>
   situates the revelation at Sinai, while
   <a href="#deu5-2">
    5:2
   </a>
   refers to this sacred site as Horeb. But the most significant difference between these two texts lies in the Israelites’ own state of mind.

   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    Exodus 19–20
   </a>
   , they have successfully fled the Egyptians, crossed the Sea of Reeds, and been fed in the wilderness on manna; the danger is behind them. When they hear the first of the “Ten Words”—“I
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt”—each of them has a personal understanding of the God they have known and experienced.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In Deuteronomy, however, the danger lies ahead. Of those hearing Moses’ recitation of the commandments this time, almost none actually fled Egypt themselves. Earlier, they may have witnessed their rebellious parents’ refusal to fight for the Promised Land (
   <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_13.1-33">
    Numbers 13–14
   </a>
   ); but now, precious few of them still has a living parent. The giants of their youth—Moses, Aaron, and Miriam—are either dead or soon will be. The Israelites themselves, untested, will have to battle their way into the Promised Land in order to settle there. In Exodus, the Israelites are preoccupied with the present; in Deuteronomy, they are focused on the future.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Religion promises us a meaningful world. If we are not free, whether because of physical or psychological enslavement, then life may not be meaningful. But death also threatens meaning, so one of religion’s major tasks is to reconcile us to the losses we experience and, ultimately, to our own mortality. Our religion must convince us that although death exits, meaning abides. We are finite not only because we die, but also because we have chosen the particular life we live. A people’s story spreads over a large canvas
   <a id="page_1085">
   </a>
   and lifts up everyone who participates in its story. When we identify with those who came before us and when we are invested in those who will come after us, then we are part of something much larger than our individual lives and efforts.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   While religion can help us find meaning in the face of death, the experience of bereavement transcends our cognitive experience. In particular, with the death of one’s parents comes a feeling of loss and, subsequently, a quest for enduring values. During the final years in the wilderness, after their parents have died, the members of the generation about to enter into the Promised Land go through a gradual reassessment of their parents’ identities, trying to figure out who their ancestors were and who they are themselves. As Moses recounts all that has transpired since the Israelites escaped from Egypt, he emphasizes that the prior generation died because they lacked faith: disillusioned, they had doubted God’s plan to fulfill the covenant of the ancestors and settle them in the Promised Land. Now, standing in Moab, poised to complete the forty-year journey, the current generation comes to admire and appreciate the stark honesty of their parents, who had passed on the history of their own inadequacies so that their children would not “be like their ancestors, a wayward and defiant generation, a generation whose heart was inconstant, whose spirit was not true to God” (Psalm 78:8).

   How much deeper their understanding of their parents must have become when they themselves became adults and assumed the formidable task of raising the next generation! Now they face the awesome but voluntary task of carrying on the chain of tradition. After all, if they do not do so, no one else will. Their parents’ passing likely led them to understand that they are part of something larger than themselves, as well as to realize that they are merely a brief but significant moment in the life of the Jewish people. It is said that we become fully human and adult when we touch death. The loss of our parents makes us aware that we, too, are part of a generation that will die.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   As the Israelites listen to Moses repeat the Decalogue, their biological parents are gone and their parent figure, Moses, will soon die. How can they find the invincible parent? Somehow, the people must internalize their ideal parent—in other words, they must parent themselves—and then raise the next generation. Their focus must shift to the next generation, the one without grandparents. The experience makes us better appreciate why the concept of
   <i>
    l’dor vador
   </i>
   (“from generation to generation”) is so central in our tradition.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Since mourning is a creative process, we can ask what new growth there is in the Israelites’ understanding of the Decalogue. Its commandments initially were addressed to those who had directly experienced the exodus from Egypt. If these words were to have the same force for subsequent generations, they must understand the word “Egypt” to represent all the ways in which they are constricted, degraded, and enslaved. And so, as those about to enter the Promised Land hear Moses repeat these words, they think of the “Egypt” of loss and the long “hard labor” of mourning. The God who had brought them out of Egypt becomes the God who comforts them, dries their tears, and encourages them to continue on their way after their parents have been buried in the wilderness. The God of comfort becomes a crucial addition to the ways in which the Israelites understand the One who freed them “from Egypt with a mighty hand” (
   <a href="#deu6-21">
    6:21
   </a>
   ). As they prepare to settle in the Promised Land and face the vicissitudes of the next part of their formation as the Jewish people, this revelation of the Divine will prove to be particularly important.

    The origins of the Torah remain a mystery. Although it would be satisfying to know, the authority of the Torah need not be diminished by the mystery, for its authority goes beyond the origins of the text. It is grounded in the millions of Jews over hundreds of generations who claimed it, cherished it, nurtured it, obeyed it, embellished it, and built out of it a tradition that enriches the world and illumines our lives. That history both confers and confirms its holiness. Where the Torah came from is not as critical as what it means to us, how it has built our people and helped us map our world and our destination.
