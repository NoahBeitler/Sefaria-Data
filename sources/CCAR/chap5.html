   (“the life of Sarah”) opens with the death and burial of Sarah. It centers on the introduction of Rebekah as a wife to Isaac and concludes with the deaths of Abraham and of Ishmael. Within this framework, the Torah relates two incidents in detail: how Sarah’s death prompts Abraham’s purchase of a burial plot in the promised land; and how Rebekah agrees to leave her homeland and family in Aram-naharaim in order to marry Isaac.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   With these two incidents, Abraham begins to realize the divine promises of land and progeny. It becomes evident that these divine promises are deeply connected to the lives of women, in particular to the matriarchs. To guarantee that Sarah has a permanent resting spot, Abraham purchases the cave of Machpelah. This purchase marks Abraham’s first concrete step toward realizing the divine promise of land, for he acquires legitimate title to the field containing the cave. Second, Abraham achieves his goal that Isaac marry a woman from the land of his birth when Rebekah emerges as a more-than-suitable wife for Isaac. Through that marriage to Isaac, the future of the patriarch’s family will be assured and, by extension, the covenant with God will be renewed.

  <div class="tab-en1">
   The longest unit in the parashah,
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24
   </a>
   , is devoted to what has been called the Courting of Rebekah. It introduces Rebekah as an energetic young woman who, like Abraham (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    Genesis 12
   </a>
   ), embarks on a journey to a distant land.

   The closing unit accentuates Isaac’s special standing. Abraham sends away the sons who were born to him through his subsequent wife, Keturah, and through the concubines he had taken (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_25.1-18">
    25:1–6
   </a>
   ). Isaac thus remains his sole heir. This accords both with God’s promise that “My covenant I will maintain with Isaac” (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
    Genesis 17:21
   </a>
   ) and with Sarah’s demand that Ishmael (and presumably other of Abraham’s sons) not inherit with her son, Isaac (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_21.8-21">
    21:10
   </a>
   ). This separation from Ishmael highlights the continuing question of identity formation in relation to other peoples.

    Sarah’s Death Leads Abraham to Acquire Land
   </i>
  </div>
  <div class="head1" id="ge_23.1_20">
   THE PURCHASE OF THE FIELD OF MACHPELAH (23:1–20)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en">
   <span class="dropcap-s">
    W
   </span>
   hy does the Torah present such a lengthy description of the purchase of the cave of Machpelah? Biblical narrative is usually sparing of details about realia and daily life, yet the negotiations over the purchase of the field containing the cave of Machpelah are reported fully. It seems that the purchase of the field symbolizes Abraham and his family’s legal ownership of the entire promised land.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Abraham does not wish to purchase just a cave, but rather a whole burial site. He is particularly interested in Ephron’s plot since it is apparently located on the outskirts of the town (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G23-9">
    23:9
   </a>
   and
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G23-17">
    17
   </a>
   ). All this would limit potential friction with Hebron’s residents and ensure him free access to the cave. Abraham struggles to find a resting place not only for Sarah, but also for the generations he hopes would descend from him. This reflects the tension between his presently temporary status (no land and no assurance of descendants in his central line) and the promise that God has repeatedly made to him (a divine promise of land and progeny).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   According to the Bible, this site will also become the burial place of Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G25-9">
    Genesis 25:9–10
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#G35-27">
    35:27–29
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#ge_49.28-33">
    49:29–32
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#G50-13">
    50:13
   </a>
   ); hundreds of years later, the nearby city of Hebron will also serve as capital of David’s kingdom until he conquers Jerusalem.

   SARAH’S DEATH (23:1–2)

      Sarah lived.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Though beginning with her life, the chapter actually focuses on her death and burial. However, the notice that the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah is consummated in Sarah’s tent (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-67">
    24:67
   </a>
   ) suggests that her life continues through the next matriarch.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   <i>
    <b>
     <a href="#chap5-fn1a" id="chap05-fn01a">
      127 years old.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Sarah is the only matriarch whose age at death is reported. Her age surpasses the ideal 120 with the sacred number of 7.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   No explanation is given as a cause of her death. It is reasonable to assume that it was her age, but as Abraham was last seen in Beersheba (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G22-19">
    22:19
   </a>
   ), some distance from where Sarah died, one may ask: Did Sarah know about Abraham’s binding of Isaac (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_21.22-22.19">
    Genesis 22
   </a>
   )? Was that a factor in her death? Perhaps Sarah had been living apart from Abraham.

    </b>
   </i>
   This verse marks one of only two instances where the Torah uses the root
   <i>
    s-p-d,
   </i>
   to mourn. (The other is in
   <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#ge_50.1-13">
    Genesis 50:10
   </a>
   , when Joseph mourns the passing of his father Jacob.) This is also the only place where the text mentions details of mourning in connection with a woman’s death. Even Jacob’s mourning over his beloved Rachel is not recorded (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_35.1-36.43">
    Genesis 35:19–20
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="ge_vv.3-18">
   ABRAHAM NEGOTIATES FOR A BURIAL GROUND (23:3–18)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   As soon as Abraham rises from beside Sarah’s body, he seeks out her burial place. Abraham addresses a representative body of town citizens that is called “the Hittites” but also “the people of the land” (v. 7) and “the town leaders” (literally “those who entered the gate of the city”; v. 10). Hittites are associated with an ancient empire that was centered in today’s Turkey.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   As Abraham declares at the outset, he is a resident alien (a “foreigner living for a time” among the native population) and thus dependent upon the good will of the local landowners. He makes it clear that he wishes to acquire an entire burial site, including field, cave and trees—not only a cave. This language reflects Abraham’s attempt to realize God’s first promise to him, of land. It also foreshadows his steps to realize God’s second promise, of progeny (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">

     <a href="#chap5-fn7" id="chap05-fn07">

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The courtesy, respect, and ready response of the Hittites allow Abraham to specify that he is particularly interested in the cave within the plot of Ephron, and that he wishes to purchase it at whatever price they require.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">

   Abraham makes it clear that he does not want a grant or gift; rather, he desires legal rights to the entire field through full purchase of the property.

    </b>
   </i>
   Abraham does not haggle, but hastens to pay the required sum, high as it might be. The purchase is made according to legal custom in the presence of the town’s leaders, at the city gate, which is the traditional seat of justice and place to notarize transactions. The text emphasizes that the purchase includes the field and all it contains. Similar declarations recur afterward (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G25-9">
    25:9–10
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#ge_49.28-33">

   </a>
   ,
   <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#G50-13">

   ), indicating the importance of the purchase.

  <div class="head2" id="ge_vv.19-20">
   CONCLUSION: SARAH’S BURIAL (23:19–20)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   More time is devoted to the negotiations than to the burial itself (on burial customs, see
   <i>
    Va-y’chi,
   </i>
   <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#page_297">
    Another View

   ). After Sarah is buried, the text reiterates that the field and all within it became Abraham’s rightful possession. Thus Sarah’s grave is the first permanent, legal presence in the land promised to Abraham and to their descendants.

     , God of my master Abraham, if You truly intend to clear the way on which I am going,
     <sup>
      43

     here I am at the water-fount. When a young woman comes out to get water, I will say to her, “Please give me a drink of water from your pitcher.”
     <sup>
      44
     </sup>
     If she answers, “Go ahead and drink, and I will draw water for your camels, too”—let her be the one You have designated as the wife for my master’s son.’
     <sup>
      45
     </sup>
     Before I had finished rehearsing my thought, Rebekah came with a water pitcher on her shoulder and went down to the well to get water. I said to her: ‘Please give me a drink.’
     <sup>
      46
     </sup>
     She quickly lowered her pitcher and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels, too.’ So I drank, and she gave water to the camels, too.
     <sup>
      47
     </sup>
     I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she answered, ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor and Milcah.’ Then I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists.
     <sup>
      48

     I knelt down in worship of

   he major factor that motivates the story of Rebekah’s betrothal is Abraham’s concern with preventing his son Isaac, his designated heir to the divine promise, from establishing blood ties with the Canaanites in the land. The story turns upon divine providence and God’s covert intervention. God is present behind the scenes, planning and directing the course of events.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Concerns with group identity and its relation to the surroundings continue throughout the patriarchal and matriarchal narratives, which repeatedly stress ties with the land of Israel. Thus Abraham takes pains to obtain his servant’s promise not to allow Isaac to return to the land Abraham left behind. At the same time, Abraham sends his servant to bring a wife for Isaac from his extended family in the distant homeland, preferring family ties over those with the natives of the land. In contrast to this attitude, the story of Joseph will later report, with no hint of criticism, that he marries the Egyptian daughter of an Egyptian priest (
   <a href="13_chapter_10.xhtml#ge_41.1-57">
    Genesis 41:45
   </a>
   ). In other words, Genesis integrates apparently conflicting positions alongside each other—as is found throughout the Bible. One tendency calls for keeping separate from the other nations (see
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_6.1-7.5">
    Deuteronomy 7:1–4
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_23.1-9">
    23:4–9
   </a>
   ; Ezra 9–11), while the other outlook is universalistic and open to the stranger (see
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.37-42">
    Exodus 12:38
   </a>
   ; Ruth 1–4).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   This story also reflects the seemingly dual (even contradictory) positions that women hold throughout the
   <i>
    Tanach:
   </i>
   at times as passive characters, and at others as decision makers who assert their will on others. The text introduces Rebekah to the reader through a narrative account (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-15">
    24:15–16
   </a>
   ); but Rebekah introduces herself to the servant using her own words (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-24">
    24:24
   </a>
   ). At first, Rebekah’s brother and father, Laban and Bethuel, give Rebekah to the servant so that she might marry Isaac (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-51">
    24:51
   </a>
   ). However, Rebekah is the one whose consent is needed before the caravan can depart (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-58">
    24:58
   </a>

   A well figures in two other biblical stories as the meeting place where the hero encounters the woman he will marry (Jacob meets Rachel in
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.1-30">
    Genesis 29:1–14

   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.1-22">

   </a>
   ). It is likely that this motif is rooted in ancient social reality, in which the well served as a place of meeting and assembly (Judges 5:11). In the framework of this motif, the characters’ behavior by the well is tested. In the present story, the girl’s hospitality surpasses the servant’s expectations. [Drawing well water appears to be the task specifically of the households’ daughters, who proceed unchaperoned (see also v. 11; I Samuel 9:11). —

   The word
   <i>

   is often translated as “virgin” but has a broader meaning than a biological one. In the ancient world, women often married shortly after puberty; therefore, one can assume that Rebekah is very young. Isaac, her future husband, is forty years old (

   Once the servant asks Rebekah for “a little water” from her jar (v. 17), she assumes the role of primary actor.

   The servant emphasizes divine intervention in order to convince his hosts that his mission is in accordance with divine will—so that they will entrust Rebekah to him. The servant is also aware of the human weaknesses of his hosts; he therefore expands his description of Abraham’s wealth (v. 35) and stresses that Isaac is his master’s sole heir (v. 36). He also reverses the order in which he asked the name of the girl and presented her with ornaments so they would not say, “How could you give her [the jewelry] when you did not yet know who she was?” (Rashi).

   Rebekah’s decision to leave her homeland and her family, go to a new place, and live with a man unknown to her, is reminiscent of Abraham, who left everything behind him in order to fulfill a divine command (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    12:1
   </a>
   ). Women’s contribution to the fulfillment of national destiny finds its expression not only in their role as childbearers but also in their ability to take bold and vital action at critical moments. Rebekah’s actions will later find an echo in Ruth’s leaving her father, mother, and land of her own accord. When Ruth joins her fate with that of her mother-in-law, Naomi, and subsequently marries Naomi’s kinsman Boaz, Ruth too contributes to fulfilling the national destiny, in that King David would be the future offspring of that union.

   The apparent role of chance in both stories, as expressed by the Hebrew root

   ), while of Ruth it is written “as luck would have it, it was the piece of land belonging to Boaz” (Ruth 2:3). Divine providence seems to direct the fate of both these women. Moreover, when the servant learns Rebekah’s identity, he blesses God, saying, “Blessed is
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   , God of my master Abraham, whose faithful kindness has not deserted my master” (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">

   This is the first time that we read about a man’s love for a woman. Biblical literature only twice mentions women’s love of men (Michal’s love for David in I Samuel 18:20 and 28; and the Song of Songs). Men’s love appears more frequently, as for example Jacob’s love for Rachel (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.1-30">
    Genesis 29:18
   </a>
   ), Shechem’s love of Dinah (34:3), and Jonathan’s love for David (I Samuel 18:1, 3). In many of those cases, as in ours, the use of the verb “love” implies a sexual relationship.

   In the previous story, Abraham’s concern was providing Isaac with a wife. In this unit, he takes steps to ensure that his other sons shall have no portion in the inheritance of the land of Canaan, which is destined for Isaac’s hands alone. In this manner, he fulfills Sarah’s demand that others will not inherit with her son Isaac (

   Some interpreters see Keturah as one of Abraham’s concubines, since v. 6 mentions “the sons of Abraham’s concubines.” Such is in fact stated in I Chronicles 1:32. The name Keturah is connected in Hebrew to incense and fragrant spices (see Song of Songs 3:6). The Bible gives no further information about her (but see

   ). The Hebrew word
   <i>
    pilegesh

    SAAC’S LOVE FOR REBEKAH
   </small>
   (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-67">
    24:67
   </a>
   ) is the first mention of spousal love in the Bible. Like other ancient Near Eastern sources, the Bible shows a concern with preserving family possessions, both tangible (land) and intangible (blessings and identity). Arranged marriages serve this purpose. Love, however, is also mentioned as a motive for marriage: Jacob loves Rachel (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.1-30">
    Genesis 29:30
   </a>
   ), and Michal loves David (I Samuel 18:20). With Isaac, love follows rather than precedes marriage. We do not know whether Rebekah loves Isaac. Reports of a woman’s love for a man are rare, found only with Princess Michal (I Samuel 18:20 and 48) and in sensual terms in Song of Songs (see, for example,
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#G1-7">
    1:7
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The Bible is largely silent about marriage procedures. In fact,
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24
   </a>
   remains the most detailed biblical source on this subject. The customs it describes largely correspond to information from ancient Mesopotamian texts. According to both sources, parents usually arrange the marriage (as when Shechem’s father negotiates a marriage with Dinah in
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
    Genesis 34
   </a>
   , or when Samson asks his father
   <i>
    and
   </i>
   mother to get him a wife in Judges 14:2–3). Brothers sometimes act in this role (see Laban in
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24
   </a>
   ). The groom or his family brings gifts for the bride’s family. In the Bible these gifts are called
   <i>
    mohar,
   </i>
   a term without the misleading commercial overtones of its usual English translation as “bride-price.” The servant’s gifts in
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24
   </a>
   may represent the
   <i>
    mohar.
   </i>
   In some Babylonian documents, the bride’s father also gives gifts. (See
   <a href="fm-07.xhtml#page_xli">
    Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview
   </a>
   .)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24
   </a>
   emphasizes Rebekah’s role in the marriage negotiations. The servant bestows expensive gifts mostly on Rebekah herself (“objects of silver and gold, and garments”), with only some for her brother and mother (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-51">
    24:53
   </a>
   ; note the silence about the father). Moreover, she chooses when to go to her husband (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-58">
    24:55–58
   </a>
   ). In contrast, the groom, Isaac, plays no role in the arrangements. These details emphasize the union of Rebekah and Isaac as one in which the woman is assertive and the man compliant. This depiction sets the stage for Rebekah’s prominence in subsequent episodes (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_25.19-26">
    25:22–23

   ). A 13th-century Yemenite Midrash collection begins its interpretations of this parashah with an extended commentary on Proverbs 31, the description of a “woman of valor.” The midrash connects the various exemplary qualities of the outstanding wife of Proverbs 31 to twenty-three biblical women, in order of their scriptural appearance. The second woman discussed (after Noah’s wife) is Sarah: “‘The heart of her husband trusts in her’ (Proverbs 31:11)—this is Sarah, in whom Abraham’s heart trusted. ‘And lacks no good thing’ (same verse)—for she used to bring guests [converts] under the wings of the Shechinah”

    Genesis 25:21

   in ritual purity” (see

   ). This marriage is mentioned following Isaac’s marriage to Rebekah. One midrash learns from this that “if a man has grown-up sons, he must first see that they marry, and only then take a wife himself”
   <i>
    (B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   60.16). | The Rabbis wondered who Keturah was, since no information is given about her origins or lineage. Some of the sages insisted she was actually Hagar, who, they argued, had returned to Abraham after Sarah’s death (
   <i>
    Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer
   </i>
   30, among others). And lest anyone be concerned about Hagar’s chastity during her absence from Abraham’s household, another midrash explains, based on the linguistic similarities between the Hebrew root
   <i>
    k-t-r
   </i>
   (to “tie up” or “seal”) and the name Keturah, “that she was like one who seals up a treasure and produces it with its seal”
   <i>
    (B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   61.4). An alternate and late midrashic tradition understands Keturah to be a separate individual from Hagar. This midrash relates that Abraham married three wives and that each was a descendant of one of the sons of Noah: Sarah was of the line of Shem, Keturah descended from Japheth, and Hagar was from the family of Ham

   to mourn for Sarah and to bewail her” (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_23.1-20">
    Genesis 23:2
   </a>
   ). With this verse, our parashah invites us to consider the history of a significant yet often obscured tradition in women’s discourse, namely, mourning.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In this parashah we have the first account of mourning (even though death has figured prominently earlier). Here a woman, Sarah, is mourned, and the mourner is a man, Abraham her husband. Yet sources disclose that in the ancient world the act of mourning was typically associated with women. Margaret Alexiou’s landmark study,
   <i>
    The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition
   </i>
   (1974), calls attention to the gendered characteristics of mourning practices and language. Throughout antiquity, in both Greek and Middle Eastern cultures, the lament—a standard feature of ritual life—belonged largely to women who gathered to lead the community in the rites of grief. In the Bible, just as in the Classical tradition, the lament was associated with the feminine. The book of Jeremiah lets us hear the bitter weeping of Rachel, mourning over her absent children (Jeremiah 31:15). That book also conspicuously presents songs of communal loss as a maternal legacy; because of disaster, the prophet instructs the women thus: “Teach your daughters wailing, and one another lamentation” (Jeremiah 9:19). When the world splits open, when history fails, the feminine voice is made audible.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The Bible does not preserve actual descriptions of mourning rituals or women’s laments. What we do have is the book of Lamentations, a national lament, in which—as is common in laments—the poet repeatedly appropriates a female persona, singing as if a woman: “My children are forlorn, / For the foe has prevailed” (1:16). Composed in response to the destruction of Jerusalem (586
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   ) at the hands of the Neo-Babylonian army, Lamentations chronicles a nation’s effort to know itself in the aftermath of a profound severing of its relation to God—the divine principle that confers meaning upon the social order. And in this book, catastrophe is repeatedly gendered. The female is the subject reciting the lament; she is also the object of exploitation, since to the poet the feminine body represents the site of social disrepair. In this way, Lamentations provides yet another textual example of the widespread symbol of nation-as-woman, ever vulnerable to foreign invasion. Women are cast as the ideal speakers of loss and rupture, for that is a condition which they embody.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Lamentations opens with a cluster of images figuring Jerusalem as an abandoned woman; she is likened variously to a slave, a fallen princess, and a widow—an
   <i>
    almanah,
   </i>
   a term Alan Mintz points out “designates not so much a woman who has lost her husband as the social status of a woman who has no legal protector and who may thus be abused with impunity” (
   <i>
    Reading Hebrew Literature,
   </i>
   2002, p. 24). Indeed,
   <i>
    almanah
   </i>
   may be etymologically linked to the Hebrew verb that means to be mute or dumb (with the letters
   <i>
    aleph, lamed,
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    mem
   </i>
   ). This association deepens our sense of the widow as one who cannot speak on her own behalf. Focusing on the structures of meaning in the Hebrew Bible, Elaine Scarry identifies a crucial division between God manifested as a
   <i>
    voice
   </i>
   and humanity as
   <i>
    embodied:
   </i>
   “To have a body is to be creatable,…and woundable. To have no body, to have only a voice, is to be none of these things; it is to be the wounder but not oneself woundable” (
   <i>
    The Body in Pain,
   </i>
   1985, p. 206). The distinction is central to Lamentations, where “daughter Zion” is represented, especially in the first chapters, as virtually all body, broken and disabled.

   Turning to the post-biblical period, women continue
   <a id="page_130">
   </a>
   to dominate in the mention of laments. Rabbinic tractates include a few such references. For example, in Mishnah
   <i>
    K’tubot
   </i>
   (4:4), Rabbi Yehuda rules that even the poorest husband must provide one lament-singing woman for his wife’s funeral, as a minimum display of honor. In the Talmud, we find a suite of poetic fragments which suggest that the lament, as a standard feature of ritual life, belonged largely to the women who gathered to lead the community in the rites. Attributed to the sage Raba, we read: “The women of Shkanziv say: ‘Woe for his leaving / woe for our grieving’” (BT
   <i>
    Moed Katan
   </i>
   28b). To this day, Yemenite and Kurdistani women living in Israel continue to assume a large role in mourning the dead in their communities. (See Susan Sered,
   <i>
    Women as Ritual Experts,
   </i>
   1992.)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In Western culture, meanwhile, the genre of lament has become a useful frame for women poets. Dahlia Ravikovitch, who emerged as an important Israeli poet during the 1950s, has been described as a “lamenting poetess in the ancient biblical tradition” (Shirley Kaufman et al., eds.,
   <i>
    Hebrew Feminist Poems,
   </i>
   1999, p. 13). A particularly beautiful and haunting example of Ravikovitch’s contribution to the genre may be found in her poem “They Required a Song of Us.” The poem begins with a line from another well-known Israeli poet, Lea Goldberg, who asks: “How shall we sing a song of Zion / when we have not even begun to hear?” Like Goldberg’s query, Ravikovitch’s poem meditates on Psalm 137, a famous expression of exilic despair in the Bible, where the speaker asks: “How can we sing a song of
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   on alien soil?” Ravikovitch answers this ancient query by recognizing the need for a new kind of utterance: “Sing intimate songs / that the soul shies away from singing…” (Tal Nizan, ed.,
   <i>
    With an Iron Pen: Hebrew Protest Poetry 1984—2004,
   </i>
   2005).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Turning to twentieth-century Jewish American poetry, we find new variations on the lament in the work of Adrienne Rich. Wrestling with the expressive limitations of other forms of poetic mourning, Rich writes of her frustration in “A Woman Dead In Her Forties.” Here the speaker first confronts the genre of lament’s potential inadequacy, feeling “half-afraid” to write a lament for one who did not “read it much”—and then gropes for an alternative: “from here on I want,” she writes, “more crazy mourning, more howl, more keening” (
   <i>
    Facts on a Doorframe,
   </i>
   2002, p. 255). This discontent compels Rich to reactivate the lament in her 1991 volume
   <i>
    An Atlas of the Difficult World.
   </i>
   In a later collection, written in the aftermath of the Gulf War crisis (1991–92), Rich longs to convey what she knows to be true: that poetry can be a powerful, socially constitutive force for reconfiguring community (
   <i>
    What is Found There,
   </i>
   1993, p. xiv). Poets such as Merle Feld, Esther Broner, and Penina Adelman also explore the power of mourning. Their versions of lament, along with Rich’s, alert us to the reconstructive possibilities of an ancient biblical form.
