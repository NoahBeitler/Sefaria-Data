   </small>
   (“stand”) contains the bulk of Moses’ third and final speech in the book of Deuteronomy, his last exhortation in Moab to observe the covenant. In this address, which began at the end of the previous parashah (
   <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#levisa10">
    29:1–8
   </a>
   ), Moses foreshadows the full sequence of iniquity, judgment, repentance, and deliverance that he predicts Israel will experience. He concludes his words with an impassioned plea to his audience to “choose life” (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#deu_30-19">
    30:19
   </a>
   ) by adhering to the
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   (Teaching), a choice that will guarantee peace and prosperity.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Each of the three units of
   <i>
    parashat Nitzavim
   </i>
   brings out its two governing themes—presence versus absence, and exposure versus concealment. The first part of the parashah (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn9-1">
    29:9–28
   </a>
   ) emphasizes the inclusion of every single member of the community in the covenant and their participation in the covenant ceremony. Women and men, officials and laborers, those standing before Moses in Moab and future generations—all commit themselves to uphold the terms of the covenant. This commitment leads to a warning against secret disobedient behavior, followed by a depiction of the fierce judgment God will unleash upon the land and the people if they turn away from God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The second part of the parashah (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#levisa11">
    30:1–10
   </a>
   ) opens with a promise of restoration once the people repent. Repeatedly, here and in the subsequent unit, Moses calls upon the people to love God with all their hearts and souls (
   <a href="#deu30-6">
    vv. 6
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#deu30-16">
    16
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#deu30-20">
    20
   </a>
   ). This formulaic language is familiar from elsewhere in Deuteronomy (particularly
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#chap-fn5-4">
    6:5
   </a>
   ), reminding the people that they must fulfill their part of the covenant through their fierce loyalty to God and God’s teachings.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The third part of the parashah (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn11-1">
    30:11–20
   </a>
   ) returns to the subject of the covenant and the contrast between the overt and the covert. Moses assures the people that the “Instruction”
   <i>
    (mitzvah)
   </i>
   is not hidden or beyond reach, but is close and obtainable (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn11-1">
    30:11–14
   </a>
   ). He stresses that God gives each individual and the entire people two clear choices: “life and prosperity, death and adversity” (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#deu_30-19">
    30:15
   </a>
   ). With heaven and earth as witnesses to the covenant, Moses implores the people to choose life instead of death, blessing instead of curse (
   <a href="#deu30-19">
    v. 19
   </a>
   ).

  </div>
  <div class="image0">
   <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   One of the hallmarks of this parashah is the inclusion of women in the list of social groups participating in the covenant ceremony. The explicit mention of women in
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn9-1">
    29:10
   </a>
   leaves no doubt that women are part of the people obliged to follow God’s covenant. Nevertheless, their position in the list designates their lower
   <a id="page_1218">
   </a>
   status in ancient Israelite society (see at
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn9-1">
    29:9–10
   </a>
   ). The parashah refers to women again in
   <a href="#deu29-17">
    29:17
   </a>
   as part of a list of possible sinners. Thus, the text affirms that women and men alike, not only those preparing to enter the Promised Land but also the generations to follow, have the potential either to break or to maintain the covenant: it is “in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it” (
   <a href="#deu30-14">
    30:14
   </a>
   ).

   The two phrases
   <i>
    avar bi-vrit
   </i>
   (entered into a covenant;
   <a href="#deu29-11">
    v. 11
   </a>
   ) and
   <i>
    karat b’rit
   </i>
   (made a covenant;
   <a href="#deu29-13">
    v. 13
   </a>
   ) designate ratifying a covenant by accepting its terms. In covenant rituals,
   <i>
    k-r-t
   </i>
   (whose basic meaning is “to cut”) refers to the cutting of animals, and
   <i>
    e-b-r
   </i>
   (whose basic meaning is “to cross over”) signifies the passing between the parts of the animal (see at
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g15-10">
    Genesis 15:10
   </a>
   ; Jeremiah 34:18–19). Although this part of the parashah does not describe the covenant celebration, other biblical texts and ancient Near Eastern evidence indicate that sacrificial offerings were part of the acceptance of a covenant (see
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#levisa12">
    Genesis 31:44–54
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#levisa13">

   </a>
   ;
   <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#levisa14">
    Deuteronomy 27:1–8
   </a>
   ). Furthermore, this section accentuates three conceptual angles of the covenant: its clear hierarchy of the parties, in that it is the people who “cross over” into God’s covenant (
   <a href="#deu29-11">
    v. 11
   </a>
   ); its content (
   <a href="#deu29-11">
    v. 12
   </a>
   ); and the people’s commitment to it, whether present in the ceremony or even absent from it (

   The inclusiveness described here is a unique feature of the Moab covenant. Compare the general term “the people” used to characterize the participation in the Sinai covenant (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-8">
    Exodus 19:9–13
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#levisa15">
    24:3
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num23-6">
    7
   </a>
   ). Whereas the text in Exodus raises the question of whether or not women stood at Sinai (see
   <i>
    <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml">
     parashat Yitro
    </a>
   </i>
   ), here there is no doubt that both women and men are the recipients of God’s teachings. The detailed list in this passage mentions various groups according to their social status.
   <a href="#deu_29.9-28">
    Verse 9
   </a>
   opens with leaders and concludes with “all the men of Israel”;
   <a href="#chap-fn10-1">
    v. 10
   </a>
   adds those dependent on the aforementioned men as heads of the household: children, women, and foreign workers. [While in some senses householders’ senior wives were dependent, in other senses their status was complementary to that of their spouses and higher than that of other male members of the household.

   The first part of Moses’ speech (

    29:18
   </a>
   , at the end of
   <i>
    parashat Ki Tavo)
   </i>
   looked back on key events in the past and the lessons to learn from them; now the focus shifts to the present moment and even to the future. The leitmotif “this day” (
   <a href="#deu29-14">
    here and in v. 14
   </a>
   ) functions as a message to the double audience of Deuteronomy, namely, the implicit audience at the time of Moses and the audience contemporary with the author(s) of the book of Deuteronomy, centuries later. The ceremony validates the covenant’s power to obligate the descendants to the treaty and to abide by its stipulations.

   , which concern cases where the community’s fortune may be determined by the misconduct of but a few individuals, the present section focuses on a different aspect of the situation: singling out the persons who sin and threatening them with total annihilation.

   Idolatry is usually connected to Canaan and Canaanite influences. Yet this passage mentions worshipping other gods as a temptation to which the people were exposed earlier, in Egypt and on the journey to the Land (mostly by the nations of Transjordan, such as the Moabite women in
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#N25-1">
    Numbers 25:1–5
   </a>
   ). Nevertheless, these verses do not suggest that Israel as a nation was actually carried away to perform idolatrous practices prior to the settlement in the Land (compare the explicit accusations in Ezekiel 20:5–9; Joshua 24:14;
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#N25-1">

   , which emphasize visible transgressions, our parashah focuses on the hidden thought and intention and on following the willful or the stiffened heart (
   <i>
    bishrirut lev).
   </i>
   The heart, which in Deuteronomy is often the innermost organ of intellectual acknowledgment and piety, serves frequently in the Bible as the secret place for self-reflection (as in Ecclesiastes 2:1, 15), personal or political evil-intent (as in
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G27-42">
    Genesis 27:41
   </a>
   ; I Kings 12:26), or even for theologically illegitimate thoughts (as in

   ;
   <a href="49_chapter_46.xhtml#deu9-4">

   These two plants appear together elsewhere in the Bible, where the poisonous nature of the one and the sharp bitterness of the other serve as metaphors to illustrate various points: social injustice (Hosea 10:4; Amos 5:7; 6:12); punishment for disobedience, particularly in worshipping other gods (Jeremiah 8:14; 9:14); and memories of distress and misery (Lamentations 3:19).

   This passage describes the divine wrath and judgment on the transgressor as an implementation of the covenant’s sanctions written in the book of Teaching (
   <i>

   </i>
   ) (see
   <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#page_1207">
    28:58
   </a>
   ). The language is in the third-person singular, thus suggesting the possibility of individual retribution (see at
   <a href="#chap-fn15-1">
    vv. 15–20
   </a>
   above), a concept that existed alongside the notion of collective retribution. While the entire community suffers as a result of the sins of the few, individual offenders still pay for their misdeeds, for they receive special punishments.

   LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE DESTRUCTION (29:21–27)

   In a sharp change, the text moves from the individual judgment for a concealed sin (
   <a href="#chap-fn15-1">
    29:15–20
   </a>
   ) to the apparent destruction of both the land and people. In contrast to

   </a>

   <a href="#deu29-21">

   <a href="#deu29-23">
    vv. 23–27
   </a>
   ). Destruction and exile are considered justifiable actions that God executes in reaction to Israel’s sins. This perspective may reflect Israel and Judah’s historical experience, like that of the entire region west of the Euphrates River, when they faced the aggressive Neo-Assyrian Empire (in the 9th–7th centuries, resulting in the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722
   <small>
    B.C.E.

   ) and then the Neo-Babylonian regime (in the late 7th–6th centuries, resulting in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586

   God rained sulfurous fire over Sodom and Gomorrah (

   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 18–19
   </a>
   ) is adapted here to describe the ecological consequences of destruction. The text posits no human enemy or human warfare; instead God, as divine Warrior, acts with great might against God’s own people and land. This sort of ecological disaster stands in contrast to the divine oath after the deluge: “Never again will I bring doom upon the world on account of what people do” (
   <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g8-21">
    Genesis 8:21

   </i>
   In contrast to relying on gods the people had not experienced, Deuteronomy repeatedly calls attention to the fact that the Israelites witnessed with their own eyes the many marvelous deeds that God performed on their behalf (for instance,
   <a href="49_chapter_46.xhtml#deu7-19">
    7:19

    </b>
   </i>
   The concept that God allocated other gods for the foreign nations to worship implies that Israel was not fully monotheistic at this stage. The statement reflects a belief called monolatry, which involves the allegiance to one god, but the recognition of the existence of other deities (see also at
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_4-40">
    4:19–20
   </a>
   ). Deuteronomy repeatedly makes the point that because Israel was chosen as God’s people, they are forbidden from worshiping any other gods (as in
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_4-40">
    4:15–20;

   Torah scribes write this verb with an enlarged letter

   <i>
    lamed
   </i>
   designates the beginning of a new word, which leads one to read these letters with a different punctuation:
   <i>
    v’yesh lachem,
   </i>
   meaning, “But you [will] have [God in another land]” [David Zvi Hoffman,
   <i>
    Deuteronomy,
   </i>
   1961, p. 516]. This midrashic reading provides a significant ideological comment for those in exile, reassuring them of God’s presence among the people in a foreign land; compare Ezekiel 11:16.)

   This phrase reveals the possible time of authorship of this section. Since the people presently experience exile (as in

    4:29–31;
   </a>
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#levisa11">
    30:1–10
   </a>
   ), this suggests the text was written during the Babylonian exile. Another explanation is that these words were secondarily introduced into an earlier original pre-exilic passage that was later updated.

  <div class="head2" id="deu_v-28">
   CONCEALED AND OVERT ACTS (29:28)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   While this one enigmatic verse has accrued various interpretations over time, its possible plain meaning derives from context: the continuing opposition between the concealed and the overt in this parashah. One reading is that these are Moses’ concluding words of assurance to the people. “Concealed acts” refer to sins committed by the individual in secret, thus only God can reveal and judge (following
   <a href="#chap-fn15-1">
    vv. 15–20
   </a>
   ), whereas “overt acts” refer to public sins of a group or of the whole collective, which human judges must punish according to “this Teaching”
   <i>
    (hatorah hazot).
   </i>
   Hence, the threat of destruction (
   <a href="#deu29-21">
    vv. 21–27
   </a>
   ) stands as a punishment only if the people neglect their communal responsibility to punish individual sinners in order to save the innocent majority (so the medieval commentators Rashi and Nachmanides).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Another way to interpret this verse is to understand the concealed and the overt as time references. Hence, “concealed acts” are future events about which only God knows, such as the threatened destruction and exile (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#levisa20">
    29:21–27
   </a>
   ) or the promised consolation and restoration (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#levisa11">
    30:1–10
   </a>
   ). “Overt acts” are what God had revealed to the people concerning past divine deeds and the practical duties in God’s Teaching (so Samuel R. Driver,
   <i>
    Deuteronomy,
   </i>
   1902, p. 328, and others).

   Traditionally these two Hebrew words

    (lanu ulvaneinu

   ) and the first letter following are written with extraordinary dots (
   <i>
    n’kudot
   </i>
   ) over the letters, a scribal phenomenon that occurs in fifteen places throughout the Bible. In ancient manuscripts, such as the Qumran scrolls as well as Greek and Roman texts, dotted letters or words signify that they should be erased and clearly not pronounced. However, these biblical instances were exegetically reconsidered and the dots gained diverse symbolic values.

   holds several different meanings in its eight occurrences in this unit, all of which exemplify an internal process of change and transformation: return from the bad ways, regret, leaving the evil deeds behind, changing the way of life, and finally approaching God in a close relationship. The intertwining occurrences of the root
   <i>
    shuv
   </i>
   emphasize the reciprocal nature of the God-human relationship. First, those in exile will “take to heart” (
   <i>
    vahasheivota
   </i>
   ; literally, “your heart shall turn back”) what has happened (
   <a href="#deu_30.1-10">
    v. 1
   </a>
   ), return (
   <i>
    v’shavta
   </i>
   ) to God (
   <a href="#deu_30.1-10">
    v. 2
   </a>
   ), and obey God’s teachings. In response, God will restore the people’s fortune (
   <i>
    v’shav…et sh’vutcha
   </i>
   ; literally, “return a return”) and turn back (
   <i>
    v’shav
   </i>
   ) to gather them to their land (
   <a href="#deu30-3">
    v. 3
   </a>
   ). The people will again heed (
   <i>
    tashuv v’shamata
   </i>
   ; literally, “turn back and heed”) and be obedient to God (
   <a href="#deu30-8">
    v. 8
   </a>
   ). As a result, God will again delight (
   <i>
    yashuv…lasus
   </i>
   ; literally, “turn back and delight”) in the people’s well-being (
   <a href="#deu30-9">
    v. 9
   </a>
   ), once they return (
   <i>
    tashuv
   </i>
   ) to God with all their hearts and souls (
   <a href="#page_1226">
    v. 10
   </a>
   ).

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Literally, “circumcise your heart.” The metaphor of the circumcised heart exemplifies the profound internal transformation of each and every person. God needs to act upon the heart, where recognition of the sin develops (
   <a href="#deu_30.1-10">
    v. 2
   </a>
   ) and where full obedience and devotion reside (
   <a href="#deu30-3">
    vv. 3
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#page_1226">
    10
   </a>
   ), in a circumcision-like procedure to ensure the permanency of this change. Deuteronomy previously mentioned circumcision of the heart (“cut away, therefore, the thickening about your hearts,”
   <a href="49_chapter_46.xhtml#page_1099">
    10:16
   </a>
   ) in its demand that the people not close their hearts and stiffen their necks. In contrast, the present circumcision of the heart is a divine action of grace (so Nachmanides), or maybe of compulsion (so according to the prophet Ezekiel, 11:19–20; 36:26–28).

   This passage emphasizes that God’s teaching (“the Instruction”) is not unintelligible, but is within the realm of human comprehension. This is a polemic against the notion of wisdom as “hidden from the eyes of all living” (Job 28:21; also 42:2–3) or “elusive and deep” (Ecclesiastes 7:24; see also Proverbs 30:2–4, 18–20).

   ). Whereas the plural
   <i>

   is regularly translated as “commandments” (for instance,
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#levisa21">

   ;
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#chap-fn16a-4">

   ), in the singular,
   <i>

   designates the legal corpus as a whole, the instruction which the people should follow in its entirety and by which they exemplify their devotion to God (as in
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu6-25">

   Concluding his words on the covenant, obedience, the land, and blessing and curse, Moses offers a basic choice between two stark alternatives: life and death. He establishes a clear, logical connection between obedience to God and God’s covenant on the one hand and the reward of life on the other, which entails prosperity and thriving upon the land (
   <a href="#chap-fn15-1">
    vv. 15–16
   </a>
   ). In contrast, disobedience will inevitably bring calamity in the land, adversity, and death (
   <a href="#deu29-17">

   Moses’ last command to the people is not redundant. The two consecutive phrases present a close connection between an action and its reward. The verb “to live” and the noun “life” serve as key words in this final passage, occurring interchangeably six times. In Deuteronomy, “life” refers to the reward for obeying specific laws (as in
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#chap-fn19-1">
    16:20
   </a>
   ) or for obeying the Instruction (

   ) in general (see

   </a>
   ;
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#deu30-6">
    30:6

    HE CLOSING VERSES
   </small>
   of
   <i>
    parashat Nitzavim
   </i>
   are frequently invoked as evidence of the Torah’s insistence on human free will. According to
   <a href="#page_1227">
    Deuteronomy 30:15–21
   </a>
   , God presents Israel with a clear-cut and seemingly obvious choice between obedience, which will lead to life, and disobedience, which will lead to death. This free-will paradigm argues that Israel is responsible for its fate and that national misfortune is caused by Israel’s disobedience of the covenant. To modern historians, events like the conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians (8th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   ) or the destruction of the southern kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians (6th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   ) would be evidence of Israel’s essential powerlessness in the face of stronger nations. However, this parashah and other biblical texts insist that Israel is not a pawn at the mercy of foreign powers, but instead is wholly responsible for its own fate.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Although the articulation of free will in these verses has been central to Jewish self-understanding for centuries, in the parashah itself this notion was largely theoretical. When the exilic or post-exilic authors or redactors imagined the scene of covenant-making that occurred in the mythic past, they already knew the choice that Israel would make. If Israel experienced exile, Israel must, by definition, have made the wrong choice—namely, disobedience.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The pressing question then becomes not whether Israel has free will, but how Israel can achieve reconciliation after having made its self-destructive choice. This concern generates the other view of history articulated in this parashah: the notion that Israel’s history is a repeated sequence of iniquity, judgment, repentance, and deliverance. The Bible reiterates this pattern in the book of Judges, which frames legends about Israel’s past within statements regarding Israel’s disobedience and punishment, followed by Israel’s repentance and deliverance (as in Judges 3:5–15). Israel repeatedly disobeys the covenant and embarks on the journey of
   <i>
    t’shuvah
   </i>
   (repentance) that carries it from iniquity to deliverance. Thus, in Deuteronomy and other biblical texts, free will becomes operative not in moments of initial obedience or disobedience, but later, in the choice whether or not to repent, where the right decision ultimately leads to redemption.

   ). Midrash
   <i>
    Kohelet Rabbah
   </i>
   1.12 teaches that these verses should have been placed at the beginning of Deuteronomy, directly following the initial statement, “These are the words that Moses addressed to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan” (
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#page_1041">
    1:1
   </a>
   ). In this midrash, the Rabbis include
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn9-1">
    Deuteronomy 29:9–10
   </a>
   among other biblical verses cited to substantiate the rabbinic dictum that the Torah does not follow a chronological order (“There is no before and after in Scripture”). With this suggestion, the Rabbis accomplish two things. First,
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn9-1">
    29:9–10
   </a>
   clarifies that “all Israel” in
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#page_1041">
    1:1
   </a>
   includes tribal
   <a id="page_1229">
   </a>
   heads, elders and officials, children and women, as well as strangers within the camp. Second, they stress that
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn9-1">
    29:9–10
   </a>
   is a direct address to the people Israel. Juxtaposing these two verses emphasizes that Moses addressed all Israel, and that all Israel stood present “to enter into the covenant of your God
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="ltr">
    יהוה

   (
   <a href="#deu29-14">

   ). This verse is part of Moses’ speech to the Israelites in Moab, but the Rabbis connected it with the revelation at Sinai (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_20.1-14">
    Exodus 20
   </a>
   ), where all Jews—present and future—are said to have participated in the revelation of Torah. According to Midrash
   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah
   </i>
   28.6, the Rabbis wondered why the verb “standing” was not also used in the second part of the verse, which simply reads, “who are not with us.” They suggested that the Torah was referring to future prophets and sages, whose words of wisdom appear in later parts of the Written and Oral Torah, respectively, but who were not physically present at Sinai because they had not yet been born: “Those are the souls who will one day be created…. Since there is not yet any substance in them, the word ‘standing’ is not used with them.”

    Exodus 19:3
   </a>
   , "Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob and declare to the children of Israel,” the midrash asks why the Torah mentions both the house of Jacob and the children of Israel. The answer is that “the house of Jacob” refers to the women and “the children of Israel” refers to the men. Indeed, the midrash further imagines that God addressed the women first in order to prevent a repetition of the catastrophe in the Garden of Eden when God initially commanded Adam, but Eve (who had not heard God’s directive first-hand) transgressed “and spoiled the world.” God, therefore, addressed the women first so they would not also “nullify the Torah.”

   in which the Israelites ask Moses, “If the Torah is not in the heavens, nor beyond the sea, where is it?” Moses answers, “It is in a place very near, in your mouth and in your heart that you may do it.” The emphasis on “doing” Torah, meaning living by it, is made clear by a rabbinic interpretation of
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#page_767">
    Leviticus 26:3

In doing so, he asserts that the Torah belongs to humanity (or at least to the Rabbis) here on earth—not “in the heavens.” Miracles and even divine proclamations cannot overturn a community’s ruling. Thus the Talmud teaches that although the Torah was given by God, it remains ours to interpret.

    OR THE LAST
   </small>
   four or five decades, feminist scholars have asserted that the Bible is an androcentric work reflecting a time when men controlled property, politics, and religious life, not to mention women themselves. Those insights de-legitimized the Torah as a source of meaning and authority for many women. How could a sacred text reflect the injustices of patriarchy? It did not seem possible.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   However, the extent to which patriarchy de-legitimizes the Bible as a sacred book for women has become more nuanced in recent scholarship. While the Bible’s male-centeredness generally goes undisputed, at least in academic circles, various scholars (such as Phyllis Trible, Tikva Frymer-Kensky, and Carol Meyers) have highlighted a number of potentially mitigating or even redemptive elements concerning women. First are the powerful and highly delineated female characters in the Bible, most notably Sarah, Rebekah, Tamar, Miriam, Rahab, Deborah, and Ruth, all of whom are leaders who transform the private or public realms in which they act. Second are the Bible’s commandments that express a clear concern for the care of the marginal and/or impoverished in society: the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow. Third are the deep covenantal principles articulated in the Torah that can be used for feminist purposes.
   <i>
    Parashat Nitzavim
   </i>
   exemplifies this, with its rich, powerful—even revolutionary—concepts that can be used to further the creation of a feminist Judaism.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The parashah begins: “You stand this day, all of you, before your God
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   —you tribal heads, you elders, and you officials, all the men of Israel, you children, you women, even the stranger within your camp, from woodchopper to water drawer—to enter into the covenant of your God
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="ltr">
    יהוה
   </span>
   ” (
   <a href="#chap-fn9-1">
    29:9–11
   </a>
   ). Let’s take a close look at the language surrounding women. First of all, from the nature of the list, one can pretty safely assume that the women were not tribal leaders, elders, woodchoppers, or water drawers. The crucial fact, however, is that they are included. They are standing before God as full members of the covenantal community. In many other instances in the Torah, only the men are addressed or female inclusion is ambiguous—eclipsed by the nature of the Hebrew language itself, which retains a grammatically masculine form whether addressing or referring to an all-male group or a mixed male and female group.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Secondly, the “women” listed belong to the “you” being addressed. (The word is often translated as “your wives,” as if the women are not part of the “all of you” in
   <a href="#deu_29.9-28">
    v. 9
   </a>
   .) But here “women” are not the only ones subject to belonging. Every individual belongs to a household, a clan, a tribe. In the Hebrew Bible, belonging
   <i>
    is
   </i>
   what constitutes a people. In this particular passage, leadership and power do not set one apart as an autonomous individual. No one, not even the most powerful male tribal leader, stands alone. For better or for worse, everyone is held in an inescapable web of interconnectedness and belonging.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   With all of that, one might still dismiss the applicability of the text to us as contemporary women. Yet I believe we should not overlook the value of this text for women “this day” (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn9-1">
    29:9
   </a>
   ). Perhaps the historical context can account for some of the dispiriting force of androcentrism. The biblical authors could not imagine women in roles other than daughters who then became wives (or widows, a state also defined by marriage). Women simply were not necessarily visible if they did not fulfill wifely or maternal duties. Here we can summon the traditional concept of “the Torah
   <a id="page_1231">
   </a>
   spoke in the language of human beings” (
   <i>
    dibrah torah kilshon b’nei adam).
   </i>
   An alternative translation of this saying would be: “The Torah spoke in the language of
   <i>
    men.”
   </i>
   It is for us, as students of Torah and members of the covenantal people, to help construct our very lives in a way that takes text out of its historical context, out of its male dress or costume, and applies it to our own time. In this way, we redress Torah—and address it to ourselves and our own community, much as the Rabbis who authored the Midrash and Talmud did. It is time to do no less than to dress the Torah in the language of women.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Torah itself is explicit about the fact that this covenant is not a thing of the past. As
   <a href="#deu29-13">
    29:13–14
   </a>
   makes clear, this covenant was intended for each one of us in our own time.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The covenant is made not only with those who stood in Moab listening to Moses’ words, but also with future generations. Every Israelite since that day, and every Jew to come into this world in the future, is directly and personally included in this covenant. Thus are we—those reading the Torah now—empowered to forge our own relationship to the contents of the ongoing revelation. The tradition is not fixed; quite the contrary, it is our very active and receptive listening that gives this text its meaning and its very sanctity. The text gains its
   <i>
    k’dushah
   </i>
   (“holiness”) from those in every generation who read it and add their voices to the endless, sacred conversation about what this all means. If women exclude themselves from that process, the full power, relevancy, and truth of the Torah are diminished.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   To underline that point, the Torah itself adds words of encouragement further on in the parashah concerning our ability to apprehend this text: “Surely, this Instruction which I enjoin upon you this day is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond reach…No, the thing is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it” (
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#chap-fn11-1">
    30:11
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#deu30-14">
    14
   </a>
   ). The Torah belongs to every one of us, not just to experts or to certain segments of the community; it does not belong to men alone. As this parashah reminds us, the Torah is far more democratic, fluid, and subjective. We await revelation—and yet revelation is right here, precisely where we stand. “It is not in the heavens…No, the thing is very close to you” (
   <a href="#chap-fn12-2">
    30:12
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#chap-fn12-2">
    14
   </a>
   )—exceedingly close.
