   (“when you take”) is the fulcrum of a larger portion of Exodus that is concerned with figuring out how God and Israel will co-exist. The parashah begins with instructions regarding census taking and the Tabernacle furnishings, moves on to the narrative of the Golden Calf, and concludes with a series of covenantal stipulations. While these units do not present a seamless narrative, they do contain a series of thematically related scenes that all negotiate the central issue catalyzed by the Sinai event: How can God and Israel maintain a relationship that takes into account the enormous disparities between the two parties—God, who is utterly holy, and Israel, a “stiffnecked” and back-sliding nation that can achieve holiness but not maintain it?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en">
   By the end of the parashah, the text has affirmed three strategies for sustaining the relationship between God and Israel:
  </div>
  <div class="list1">
   1.
   <span class="space">
   </span>
   <i>
    Tabernacle:
   </i>
   The story of the Golden Calf is situated between the instructions for the Tabernacle (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
    25:1
   </a>
   –
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e30-7">
    30:10
   </a>
   ) and the description of its construction (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_33.1-36.7">
    35:1
   </a>
   –
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#E40-38">
    40:38
   </a>
   ). This arrangement affirms that the Tabernacle, unlike the calf, is an appropriate response to the people’s needs for a physical location where they can gain access to God.
  </div>
  <div class="list1">
   2.
   <span class="space">
   </span>
   <i>
    Covenant:
   </i>
   The parashah concludes with a reiteration of the covenant, thus providing Israel with laws to help keep its conduct acceptable to God.
  </div>
  <div class="list1">
   3.
   <span class="space">
   </span>
   <i>
    Moses
   </i>
   : While the other two strategies are more permanent, Moses emerges as the most crucial mediating strategy between God and Israel, the go-between who repeatedly pleads to God on behalf of Israel. Although Moses is resoundingly human, the voices of this parashah conspire to identify Moses more and more closely with God until even his physical being is supernaturally transformed (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#chap-fn29-4">
    34:29–35
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="image">

  </div>
  <div class="image0">

  </div>
  <div class="noindent1">
   The parashah refers to women directly in only a few places. In the account of the construction of the calf, Aaron directs the men to remove the jewelry from their wives, sons, and daughters (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
    32:2
   </a>
   ). The legal section at the end of the parashah prohibits marriages between Israelite men and indigenous Canaanite women (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
    34:16
   </a>
   ) and includes a polemic against
   <i>
    asherim
   </i>
   (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
    34:13
   </a>
   )—ritual objects probably related to the worship of the goddess Asherah.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <a id="page_496">
   </a>
   Nevertheless, the parashah engages two issues that are central to feminist theology and theory. In wrestling with the question of how close God can be to humanity, the text raises the issue of divine immanence and transcendence, a central concern of contemporary feminist theology (see
   <i>
    Vayak’heil,
   </i>
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#page_538">
    Another View
   </a>
   ). The parashah also highlights the importance of narrative perspective and point of view. The crucial events of the Exodus and construction of the calf are described differently by different characters. These tellings not only highlight the disparate experiences of the speakers but also serve to articulate multiple perspectives on the text’s central concerns.

   CENSUS (30:11–16)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Census taking, which was usually a prelude to military conscription or taxation, was considered an inherently dangerous act in the biblical world (see II Samuel 24). Its negative consequences must be pre-empted by paying a half-shekel ransom. Only the men of fighting age (twenty and older) are counted in the census and required to pay the tax, which in this case is to be used for the operation of the Tabernacle; women are not part of Israel’s military and not counted in the census. The high concentration of expiation language in this passage (note the four-fold repetition of the root
   <i>
    k-p-r
   </i>
   [atone, propitiate], translated here as “ransom” or “expiation”) underscores the text’s anxiety about the supernatural and societal dangers of the census.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="exo_30.17-21">
   LAVER (30:17–21)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The laver, or basin, is to be placed in the Tabernacle courtyard, between the altar for burnt offerings and the entrance to the Tabernacle itself. It is to be used by the priests to wash their hands and feet, thus ensuring that they approach the altar in a state of ritual purity. According to
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#chap-fn8-5">
    38:8
   </a>
   , this basin was made from mirrors donated by “the women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.”

   ANOINTING OIL (30:22–33)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The oil used to anoint the sacred objects and the priests is to be made of four precious spices—myrrh, cinnamon, cane, and cassia—combined with olive oil. Because the oil conveys holiness to whatever it touches, there are severe penalties for its use on profane objects and laypeople.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="exo_30.34-38">
   INCENSE (30:34–38)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The incense contains three precious spices combined with frankincense. As v. 36 indicates, the incense created a cloud of smoke that was perceived as the manifestation or sign of God’s presence. (See also at

    35:25–26
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#chap-fn32-2">

     Aaron said to them, “[You men,]

    Crisis: The Golden Calf Episode

  <div class="tab-en">

   he Golden Calf episode reveals the challenge of maintaining a relationship between “stiff-necked” Israel and its holy God. For the Rabbis, this incident functions as a “fall” story (akin to how the Garden of Eden story in
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_3.1-24">
    Genesis 3
   </a>
   functions for Christian and some later Jewish interpreters), meaning that this episode represents a rupture in the intimate connection between God and Israel and necessitates a more distant and mediated relationship.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The placement of this episode highlights the ironic link between the calf and the Tabernacle. In both instances, the people are invited to donate gold for the construction and do so willingly. The gold is then used to manufacture the ritual object and, upon its completion, the people offer sacrifices and celebrate. These similarities set into sharp relief the crucial difference between the Tabernacle, which is sanctioned by God, and the calf, which is condemned as a fatally inappropriate ritual object.

   CONSTRUCTION OF THE CALF (32:1–6)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The word
   <i>
    eigel
   </i>
   (commonly translated as “calf”) refers to a young bull or ox (see Psalm 106:19–20), both of which were symbols of power and virility and associated with the God of Israel and other gods of the ancient Near East. According to I Kings 12:25–33, King Jeroboam—the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel—erected two golden calves, one at Bethel and one at Dan. Historically, these sacred objects probably functioned like the ark and cherubim in the Jerusalem Temple: as thrones or symbols for the God of Israel who was worshipped at those shrines (see at
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#e25-18">
    25:17–21
   </a>
   ). However, in the biblical text, which reflects a Judean perspective and a later centralization of worship, the calves are condemned as inappropriate and idolatrous.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This biblical polemic provides a context for the Golden Calf episode and demonstrates the complexity of the question of “idolatry.” The Bible and later rabbinic texts imagine that visual representations of God are “idols” that are worshipped as gods by their devotees. However, in most ancient and modem cases, images of gods are understood as symbols or accessories of the god, forms of mediation that help worshippers connect to the deity. Within the parashah, the calf shares many features of the Tabernacle: both are associated with the God of Israel and are constructed out of freewill offerings of the Israelites. However, the calf is condemned while the Tabernacle is legitimated. The overlap between these two forms of mediation demonstrates how complex the questions of divine mediation and religious representation are.

   The word

   </i>
   but with singular verb forms used with that divine name. In this verse, the noun is paired with a plural verb, which might imply that the Israelites ask Aaron to make them more than one god. Or, as this translation suggests, the plural verb is used to signal that the Israelites are demanding
   <i>
    a

   god, rather than

   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   ” in v. 5 suggest that the people craved a visible symbol of God’s presence. Nevertheless, by attributing these words to the Israelites, the authors of the text portray the people as idolators, who identify and worship the calf

   Aaron’s response is complex. By constructing an altar, he facilitates the inappropriate, idolatrous understanding of the calf. Yet by declaring a “festival of

   While the Golden Calf may be defensible as a legitimate, non-idolatrous religious object from the point of view of ancient Israelite history and theology (see above), the Torah unambiguously identifies its creation as transgressive. This is clear from the fury expressed by both God and Moses.

   This verse deflects blame for the calf from Aaron to the people. Throughout the parashah, the degree of blame attributed to Aaron fluctuates. In

It is also possible to read the contradictions as a reflection of the difficulty involved in definitively identifying agency and responsibility.

   This epithet suggests that the calf is not a sign of Israelite fickleness, but rather of their stubbornness and their inability to adapt to the covenantal relationship with God that was established at Sinai (Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg,

   Moses uses two rhetorical strategies to successfully dissuade God from destroying the people. First, he argues that God’s reputation will be sullied if God annihilates the very people that God rescued from Egypt (vv. 11–12). Then, he reminds God of the covenant with the ancestors (v. 13). The success of Moses’ intervention is underscored by the reference to Israel as God’s people in v. 14.

   This punishment resembles the ordeal of the suspected adulteress in
   <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num5-11-31">
    Numbers 5:11–31

   , in which the woman suspected of adultery is forced to swallow a potion made with ink from a ritual scroll and with dirt from the Tabernacle floor. While it is doubtful that there is a historical connection between the two cases, the similarities between these texts form the basis of midrashic comments that understand the construction of the Golden Calf to be a form of theological adultery (see further the

   Aaron shifts the blame away from himself by identifying Moses’ prolonged absence as the root of the problem and limiting his involvement to the hurling of the gold into the fire (compare

   The violence perpetrated by the Levites—which contemporary readers may find disturbing—resonates interestingly with the violence perpetrated by their ancestor Levi following the violation of his sister Dinah (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
    Genesis 34
   </a>
   ). There, Levi and his brother Simeon massacre the residents of Shechem. In
   <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#chap12-fn5-2">
    Genesis 49:5–7

   , Levi is also portrayed as violent. While the earlier acts of violence are condemned, this one is praised. (See also

   Literally, “fill your hands”—a term that is usually used for the ordination of priests. According to some interpreters, this verse means that by killing their kin, the Levites consecrated themselves to God and earned God’s blessing. Others conclude the opposite: because of their actions, the Levites must dedicate themselves in atonement in order to receive God’s blessing. Note that the massacre does not suffice as punishment or atonement for the people’s transgression, for Moses still needs to beg for the people’s forgiveness and God still sends a plague as punishment (see

   [Literally, “his son and his brother.” Grammatically speaking, the reference is indefinite and nonspecific; hence the language does not specify social gender.

   (33:7–11)

  <div class="tab-enin">
   In the Torah, two different terms are used to refer to Israel’s portable wilderness sanctuary: Tabernacle and Tent of Meeting. The tent described here represents an alternate tradition that differs significantly from the Tabernacle tradition that dominates
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.10-40">
    Exodus 25–31
   </a>
   and

   </a>
   ). In the texts that refer to the sanctuary as “Tabernacle,” God’s presence is very powerful and potentially very dangerous; nevertheless, by rigorously maintaining the purity of the shrine, the Israelites can safely preserve the vital presence of God in their midst. Here, the Tent tradition—which is perhaps much older than the Tabernacle one—expresses a different perspective, one in which the stiffnecked nature of the Israelites is incompatible with the divine presence. Therefore, the Tent of Meeting stands outside the camp and only Moses and Joshua can enter it. While this view distances God further from the people, it imagines a far more direct relationship between God and Moses.

   This passage resumes the action from v. 6, as Moses challenges God’s refusal to accompany the people. In his continued persistence in seeking God’s support for the people (see also

   Here
   <i>

   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e33-7">

   </b>
   Verses 21–23 present one of the most rigorously anthropomorphic representations of God in the Torah. The references to God’s face, hand, and back must be understood in literal terms. The radical anthropomorphism communicates a vision of God that is simultaneously dangerously transcendent and intimately protective: God’s body shields Moses from God’s face (
   <i>
    panim),
   </i>
   which is portrayed as so intense that viewing it would be fatal.

   This divine self-description, referred to in the post-biblical period as the “Thirteen Attributes,” becomes a core part of the Jewish penitential liturgy for the High Holy Days, festivals, and fast days. This declaration asserts that God grants abundant mercy to the faithful and also inflicts trans-generational punishment for transgressors.

   TERMS OF THE COVENANT (34:10–28)

   God responds to Moses’ request to accompany and pardon the people by restoring the covenant. This passage begins with God’s promise to drive out the current inhabitants of Canaan. In exchange, the Israelites are to refrain from forming alliances with these inhabitants and to commit to a set of commandments similar, but not identical, to those in
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_24.1-18">

   If God drives out all the inhabitants, how can the Israelites make covenants with them? The conflict in this promise and admonition refleets a tension between two accounts of the settlement of the Promised Land in Joshua and Judges. In one version, the indigenous people are utterly displaced or destroyed; in the other, the Israelites live alongside them in the land.

   Ugaritic (northern Canaanite) texts as the consort of the high god El, and who is mentioned in the Bible in conjunction with the Canaanite god Baal. In addition, inscriptions from ancient Israel identify Asherah apparently as the companion of the God of Israel. These inscriptions, and the repeated polemics against the
   <i>
    asherim
   </i>
   in the Bible, suggest that worship of Asherah through prayers and ritual objects was once a common part of Israelite worship. The rise of strict monotheism in ancient Israel and its insistence on the legitimacy of only one God mandated Asherah’s elimination.

   The Bible expresses a range of views about marriage between Israelites and non-Israelites, from the prohibition of all marriages between Israelites and non-Israelites, to the ban on marriages between Israelite men and indigenous women of Canaan as seen here. Such marriages are viewed as risky because the women might lure their husbands into the worship of other gods. (See also

   Moses is physically transformed by his intimate encounter with God.

Other scholars have argued that “horns” is in fact the correct translation. According to such a reading, as a result of his intimate encounter with God, Moses is supernaturally marked with the sacred symbol of Israel’s God.

    HE VERSE
   </small>
   in this parashah forbidding Israelite “sons” to marry non-Israelite “daughters” (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
    34:16
   </a>
   ) has troubled many readers, both because of its negative view of outsiders and because of the way it denigrates the religious beliefs of foreign women. On each count, however, closer scrutiny provides a more nuanced, less problematic understanding.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The one-sided nature of this mandate—forbidding men but not women from marrying out (exogamy)— differs from other biblical texts (like
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#chap-fn1-4a">
    Deuteronomy 7:3
   </a>
   ) that proscribe exogamy for both women and men. Such gender-inclusive prohibitions express larger concerns for setting ethnic boundaries. Forbidding only non-Israelite
   <i>
    wives
   </i>
   may represent a different practice or tradition, one sensitive to the family dynamics of agrarian societies.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The justification for prohibiting foreign wives in
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
    Exodus 34:16
   </a>
   is that it will prevent the worship of foreign gods. This religious reason should be understood in broader terms, with foreign religion standing for the cultural patterns of another people. Endogamous marriages—in which wives shared the same culture as their husbands—perhaps better served community needs. Such brides would be well versed in the particular social customs and technologies necessary for household life, an important consideration in the precarious environment of the farming communities of the biblical period. Thus, marrying an Israelite woman was likely a strategy for survival, not an expression of cultural disdain.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In this respect, note that none of the biblical statements against intermarriage (like
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24:3
   </a>
   or Nehemiah 13:25–27) are absolute prohibitions; they are concerned only with marrying members of local populations. After all, several prominent biblical figures—both women (such as Bathsheba and Esther) and men (such as Moses, David, and Solomon)—have foreign spouses.

   Although the religious motivation given in
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
    34:16
   </a>
   for eschewing foreign brides may represent an aversion to foreign culture more generally, it is nonetheless instructive to note that the verse depicts the religious (cultural) practices of women as being more powerful than those of their husbands. Such a view is consonant with what is known about the dynamics of Israelite households: women dominated household religious praxis and exercised considerable managerial control over household life.

   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e31-2">

   ). According to rabbinic midrash, Miriam’s husband was Caleb (

   1.17;
   <i>
    Sifrei B’midbar
   </i>
   78; BT
   <i>
    Sotah
   </i>
   12a); given that Bezalel—the craftsman who designed the Tabernacle and supervised its construction—was Caleb’s great-grandson (I Chronicles 2:18–20), this means that he was also Miriam’s great-grandson. In
   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah
   </i>
   48:3–4, the Rabbis connected
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e31-2">
    Exodus 31:2–3
   </a>
   with Job 28:28, “See! Fear of Adonai is wisdom (
   <i>

   )., / To shun
   <a id="page_515">
   </a>
   evil is understanding (
   <i>
    binah
   </i>
   ).” They explained that “fear of Adonai” referred to Jochebed and Miriam, whom the Rabbis identified with the God-fearing midwives of
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_1.1-22">
    Exodus 1:21
   </a>
   . Since the reward for fearing God is Torah, Jochebed gave birth to Moses, through whom the Torah was revealed. As for Miriam, because she “shunned evil” she became the great-grandmother of Bezalel, known for his “skill (
   <i>
    chochmah),
   </i>
   ability (
   <i>
    t’vunah

   (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e30-17">
    31:18
   </a>
   ). The Hebrew expression rendered here as “upon finishing” (
   <i>
    k’chaloto
   </i>
   ) is almost identical to a term that means “as his bride.” (The two words differ by one vowel.) Based on that wordplay, the Rabbis sometimes understood part of this verse as:
   <i>
    [God] gave Moses, as his bride, the two tablets.
   </i>
   The feminine personification of the Torah as the bride of Israel is an ancient tradition. In
   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah
   </i>
   41.5, the Rabbis declared that when God “gave the Torah to Israel, it was then as dear to them as a bride is to her spouse.”

In this world, they received special privileges on Rosh Chodesh (the new), traditionally a day on which Jewish women abstained from work. And in the world-to-come, “women are destined to be renewed like the raw moons.” (For more on women and Rosh Chodesh, see

   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah
   </i>
   43.1, they likened Moses’ decision to destroy the tablets to the act of a marriage broker, sent by a king to betroth a certain woman. While the broker was en route with the marriage document, the woman “corrupted herself with another man.” Τhe broker immediately destroyed the marriage document, saying it was better that she be judged as an unattached wanton woman than as a married woman who had been unfaithful. Similarly, Μοses destroyed the tablets, saying it was better that Israel be judged as ignorant and foolish rather than as having deliberately disobeyed the commandments forbidding idolatry that they had just received.

   <i>
    D’varim Rabbah
   </i>
   3.17 asks why the first tablets were written by God and the second set were inscribed by a human being. The reply is another analogy: This is like a king who married a woman and gladly paid for all the expenses of preparing the marriage contract. When he saw his wife behaving in an inappropriate manner with one of his servants, he was enraged and sent her away. His groomsman pled on her and explained that since she was brought up among servants, she did not know her actions were wrong. The king agreed to be reconciled with his wife, but he required the contract. Similarly, Moses beseeched God to remember that Israel had spent many years in “Egypt, the house of idolatry,” and to forgive the lapse with the Golden Calf. Although God. Although God agreed to the reconciliation, God’s ardor was now cooled and Moses was required to prepare and insert the tablets himself. (So also

   , my boyfriend and I climbed the alleged Mount Sinai, with the shower of Perseus streaking the Egyptian night sky with shooting stars. At the summit, as God pulled the sun up from the fragrant desert floor, Jonathan held up a ring and proposed. It is written in
   <i>
    Pirkei Avot,

   “Every day a voice goes forth from Sinai” (
   <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#chap14-fn2-1">

   The revelation at Mount Sinai was a wedding—an eternal, loving joining between God and Israel. The story we read is but a veil covering a radiance we must allow ourselves to know.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This Torah portion,
   <i>
    Ki Tisa,
   </i>
   begins with Moses taking a census. God then chooses Bezalel to be the artisan of the Tabernacle. Moses climbs Mount Sinai, shrouded in mist and mystery, while the Israelites below build their golden idol. When Moses sees this, he breaks the stone tablets, grinds up the golden calf, and makes the Israelites drink it. Moses ascends the mountain a second time. When he descends, his face is so radiant that he must wear a veil.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   But a light
   <i>
    ruach
   </i>
   (wind) blows from the west, disturbing the mist, and we see the radiant face just beneath the veil of text.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Moses is the master alchemist. He climbs the mountain, hides in the cleft of the
   <i>
    tzur
   </i>
   (rock). He speaks with the philosopher’s stone face to face. He holds the two tablets of prime matter in his hands. When he grinds up the calf into a fine powder, stirs it into water, holds it up into the air, a brilliant liquid shimmering with flakes of gold, he creates a dizzyingly potent potion, a love potion, an elixir of life. A toast!

   is not about frenzied idol worship, but the detailed description of a spectacular wedding feast between God and the people Israel. God-the-Lover and Moses-the-beloved take a census of who shall be invited, and they make the long guest list: 600,000 and growing. Bezalel is singled out to decorate the Tent, arrange the flowers, and adorn the feast.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Time passes, and we find ourselves in the whirl of the banquet festivity. There is dancing and singing, and in the very center, what seems to be a golden calf. But blink your eyes! It is the glittering pile of precious wedding gifts.

   <i>

   One commentator points out that
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e31-18">

   , which is translated “Upon finishing (
   <i>

   <i>
    ke-challato)…
   </i>
   the two tablets.” Moses, our symbolic bride, turns around in the
   <i>
    chuppah

   and faces the guests. He lifts the contract for all to see—and then smashes the glass beneath his foot.

    33:12–23

   , we read excerpts from a conversation between God and Moses that sound particularly romantic: “Pray let me know Your ways, that I may know You and continue in Your favor” (
   <a href="#exo_33.1-23">
    v. 13
   </a>
   ). “You have truly gained My favor and I have singled you out by name” (

   ). “Oh, let me behold Your Presence!” (
   <a href="#exo_33.1-23">
    v. 18

   ). “I will make all My goodness pass before you,” (
   <a href="#exo_33.1-23">
    v. 19
   </a>
   ). And, at the end, God’s hand reaches out for Moses (

    v. 22

   ).

   Moses comes down from the mountain blushing, a crimson glow in his cheeks. Earlier, when he went into the Tent to meet our Love, he removed his veil,

   But this is only one way to imagine this mythic wedding. Instead of seeing

   to be the groom and
   <i>
    Torah
   </i>
   the bride. In
   <i>
    Midrash HaGadol,

   for example, it is written:
  </div>
  <div class="block">
   <i>
    In the third month…they entered the wilderness of Sinai
   </i>
   (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    19:1
   </a>
   ).…[This may be compared] to a king who betrothed a woman, and set a time [for the marriage]. When the time arrived they said: “It is time for the woman to enter the
   <i>
    chuppah
   </i>
   .” Similarly, when the time arrived for the Torah to be given, they said, “It is time for the Torah to be given to Israel” (Elliot R. Wolfson,
   <i>

   , 1995, P. 4).

   On the summit of the mountain, within the curtain of cloud, the question of who is marrying whom is enveloped in dreamlike fog. We might even wonder if the true union taking place upon Mount Sinai is perhaps the revelatory union of heavenly
   <i>
    Adonai
   </i>
   with earthbound
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   : God’s masculine and feminine Presence united through Israel, in love.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   When the potion wears off, the children of Israel look around them. Once again they are in the desert, long dragged-out footsteps stretching behind them. And they say one to the other, “Love is in this place, and we did not know it! What have we been doing all of this time? Where have we been? Is this the desert, or is it
   <i>
    gan eiden
   </i>
   (Garden of Eden)? Are we lost and alone, or are we this moment caught up in a fierce union with God? Are we wandering with sandals filled with dust, or are we soaring on eagles’ wings?”

  <div class="tab-enin">
   We look from one to the other—and wonder what is the face beneath the face beneath the face we wear every day. Sometimes the beauty of the other is as allusive as a sunray on the water. We seek the radiant face beneath the veil.
