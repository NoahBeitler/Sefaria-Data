   centers on the actions of the Moabite king Balak and the prophet Balaam son of Beor, whom he hires to curse Israel into oblivion (
   <a href="#num_22.2-41">
    22:2
   </a>
   –
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#N24-25">
    24:25
   </a>
   ). It concludes with a dangerous encounter and worship of Baal-peor, a Canaanite god.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   At the close of the previous parashah, the people of Israel were making final preparations to enter Canaan. The story of Balaam is inserted at this juncture because its outcome determines whether Israel will indeed inherit the Promised Land. Actually, it is a contest in the divine realm between the God of Israel and those supernatural elements available to Balak. At times amusing and somewhat mocking of the non-Israelite prophet, the message of the story is quite serious: God’s intent reigns supreme and cannot be superseded. Israel’s deity ultimately controls even the powers of a well-known foreign seer. In the end, Balaam’s four oracles reverse Balak’s goal—by blessing Israel and cursing her enemies. Notably, Balaam’s talking donkey, who is portrayed as the wiser of the pair, is a jenny (a female donkey)—perhaps reminiscent of the biblical personification of
   <i>
    chochmah,
   </i>
   “wisdom,” as female (see, for example, Proverbs 1:20).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Importantly, a visionary named Balaam son of Beor is mentioned outside the Bible; he is featured on an ancient but fragmentary plaster wall inscription, located not far from where the biblical story is set (
   <a href="#num_22.2-41">
    see further below
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The final portion of the parashah (
   <a href="#num_25.1-9">
    25:1–9
   </a>
   ) resumes the narrative begun in the first verse of
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_22.2-41">
    Numbers 22
   </a>
   but interrupted by the story of Balak and Balaam. It recounts the misadventure of a group of Israelite men who have sexual encounters with local Moabite women—and end up worshipping the local deity, Baal-peor. The account focuses on one particular couple: an Israelite man and his partner, a Midianite woman. The priest Phinehas impales the two in a fit of religious zeal. The Baal-peor incident results in the death of 24,000 Israelites who are struck down by a divinely sent plague.

   In this episode the Moabite women are depicted as dangerous enticers who lead the Israelite men to idolatry. The account serves to highlight the biblical portrait of the dangerous foreign woman, a motif prevalent in the book of Proverbs, where young men are repeatedly warned to avoid her (Proverbs 2:16
   <i>
    ;
   </i>
   5:3, 20; 7:5; 23:27; 27:13). A similar theme is found in other biblical passages as well (see
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
    Exodus 34:16

   ).

   exemplify that practice; these “Execration Texts” are smashed ceramic vessels and figurines inscribed with curses directed at Egypt’s enemies, including the rulers of Canaanite cities. Balaam’s role as a prophet and diviner likewise fits with other known examples from Mesopotamia, also from the early second millennium.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The material about Balak and Balaam seems to be an independent composition. Its narrative and poetry probably originated in a different scribal circle than those associated with other portions of Numbers.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Evidence indicates that the biblical composition is related to the non-biblical tradition attested in a wall inscription found at Deir Alla, a site east of the Jordan River. The inscription, written in a language close to Aramaic and dated to the early 8th century
   <small>
    B.C.E
   </small>
   ., records the night visions of a seer named Balaam son of Beor. That Balaam is credited with saving his people and the land from perpetual darkness by his use of oracles and exorcism. Apparently, his powers reversed the edict of a group of troublemaking deities and freed the goddess Shagar-and-Ishtar (a local version of the Mesopotamian high goddess Ishtar), whom those deities had imprisoned and forced to comply with their evil directives. It is unclear whether Balaam was a legendary character of antiquity, or a real person of some fame in the region. At any rate, the talents of that Balaam are precisely what the Moabite king, Balak, is looking for in the biblical account.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Whether legendary or historical, the Balaam story was clearly known in the 8th century (the date of the Deir Alla texts). An unanswered question is: were these traditions already circulating in Israel’s early settlement period (12th century), or did a later biblical writer cast them into the historical memory of that period?

   BALAK’S INVITATION TO BALAAM (22:2–21)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Having witnessed Israel’s destructive power in her recent encounter with the Amorites (
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num21-21">
    21:21–32
   </a>
   ), Balak seeks to engage the prophet Balaam, apparently because of Balaam’s reputation as a seer who can effectuate curses. Balaam refuses to come, after having consulted with the Israelite God and been warned not to curse the people that God has blessed. Balak ignores Balaam’s initial refusal and sends additional dignitaries tempting Balaam with promises of riches. With God’s approval, Balaam agrees to go, but only to prophesy God’s message.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Bible gives conflicting reports of Balaam’s intentions, apparently due to inconsistent pre-biblical traditions. The account here presents Balaam in a positive light. His words and actions are bound to the will of Israel’s God. Likewise, the 8th-century prophet Micah views Balaam favorably (Micah 6:5). In contrast, in
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#chap-fn4-4">
    Deuteronomy (23:4–7)

    Numbers (31:16)

   a plural noun that refers to social status. Given what we know about the ancient Near East, the presence of women among a given group of elders is unlikely, yet it cannot be entirely excluded. For instance, II Samuel 20:15–22 depicts an Israelite woman of apparently special status who fills the role that we would expect an elder to play: she represents her town in emergency negotiations with a hostile army commander. Described as an
   <i>

Claudia Camp suggests that the story “attests to what must have been a regularized public role for women, at least through the early period of the Israelite monarchy” (

   THE STORY OF THE TALKING SHE-DONKEY (22:22–35)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This tale of Balaam and the jenny—which breaks the action of the main narrative—contradicts the more favorable view of Balaam expressed by the main story; this episode apparently derives from a different tradition. In this fable, in which an animal speaks, God is angry with the seer and depicts the donkey as the actual visionary. Balaam becomes the object of mockery, being blind to the divine will that only the jenny sees. Thus the usual biblical roles of humans and animals are reversed.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Speaking animals of various kinds, including equids (horses and donkeys), are known from other ancient Near Eastern literary sources.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Perhaps significant is the fact that the donkey is female (
   <a href="#num22-21">
    see above at v. 21
   </a>
   ). Her role as the insightful one of the pair is reminiscent of the biblical notion of Lady Wisdom (especially in Proverbs 8–9). Perhaps, however, the story is merely suggesting that even a female donkey, the lowliest of the low animals, is more perceptive than Balaam.

   his unit features the reports about four oracles uttered by Balaam. It repeatedly reminds the reader that Balaam’s words are God’s message, not his own. The first three reports follow the same pattern: Balaam prepares to divine; this is followed by the oracle itself (in poetic form), concluding with Balak’s (frustrated) reaction to the oracle. The fourth oracle breaks the pattern and ends with Balaam’s returning home. The first oracle contains a brief summary of the introductory narrative (
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_22.2-41">
    Numbers 22
   </a>
   ), hinting that originally the poems may have existed independently of the story. The poetic form of Balaam’s oracles contrasts with the surrounding narratives. The poetry seems to lend authority to the narrative, and its composition may actually be older in time than the narrative.

   BALAAM’S FIRST ORACLE AND BALAK’S RESPONSE (23:1–12)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Before seeking omens and revelation, Balaam instructs Balak to sacrifice seven bulls and seven rams. In the biblical world, the number seven often signals completeness or perfection (see
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis 1:1
   </a>
   –
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#g2-7">
    2:4
   </a>
   ). Balak’s offerings indeed elicit the Deity’s message. But instead of curses from Balaam, blessings for Israel come forth.

   The verbal root

   Balaam’s second oracle (
   <a href="#num23-18">
    vv. 18–24
   </a>
   ) expands on the themes of the initial message. It focuses on God’s attributes of faithfulness vis-à-vis Israel and acknowledges Balaam’s task to actually bless Israel. The poem closes with a statement of Israel’s great power. Balak, however, is unwilling to accept the inevitable and persists in resisting the finality of the prophecy.

   After the initial blessing of Israel, Balak attempts to elicit a curse from Balaam by having the prophet view the Israelite camp from a less awesome angle. The narrator mocks Balak, who fails to understand that God’s desire may not be contravened in this manner.

   The message of the second oracle underscores that of the first. Balaam emphasizes God’s constancy in general—and specifically a devotion to Israel’s welfare. Balaam cites the redemption from Egypt as evidence of God’s power and allegiance to Israel.

   The section begins with Balak’s acknowledgment that Israel’s God is the one who controls Balaam’s ability to curse Israel. This time, when Balaam utters his prophecy, he is apparently imbued with the divine spirit common to Israel’s prophets. It seems that his role has changed from that of pagan seer to a prophet of God. The third oracle sings the praises of a triumphant Israel and concludes by cursing her enemies.

   This time the narrator states that Balaam does not search for omens in the process of seeking the divine spirit, implying that he did so previously. For the first time, Balaam views the entire Israelite camp (

   The site, high on a hill, is not only ideal for viewing the Israelite camp, but also would have housed a sanctuary to the god Baal-peor, a site that will soon become infamous when Israelite men consort there with local women (

   This third vision describes the Israelite encampment as a lush oasis (

   ), which stands in stark contrast to the wilderness background of Balaam’s actual view of that encampment (
   <a href="#num24-1">
    24:1
   </a>
   ). The oracle ends by reiterating the promise to Israel’s ancestors (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    Genesis 12:3
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G27-29">

   BALAAM’S FOURTH ORACLE (24:12–25)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Balaam makes it clear to Balak that even great riches cannot entice him if Israel’s God does not will it. In the power struggle between earthly king and the kingship of God, the victor is clearly the God of Israel. In that sense, the encounters between Balak and Balaam are comparable to those between Moses and Pharaoh prior to the Exodus.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Balaam utters a fourth oracle on his own accord following his dismissal by the angry Moabite king. This last speech not only prophesies Israel’s ultimate triumph over the other nations, but it assumes the rise of kingship and an Israelite empire.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This fourth oracle refers to several ethnic groups in the context of Israel’s future victories. Balaam predicts the destruction of Moab at the hands of an unnamed Israelite king. Judging by other biblical accounts, either David or Ahab qualifies as that king (II Samuel 8:2; II Kings 3:4–5). Indeed, the Mesha Stele—a Moabite inscription of the 9th century
   <small>
    B.C.E
   </small>
   .—commemorates the independence of Moab after years of subservience to Israel. Overall, the fourth oracle is the climax of Balaam’s prophecies, predicting a more distant but bright future awaiting Israel. As Balaam relates each of the first three oracles, his status rises; with the fourth and final oracle he becomes a universal prophet in the sense that his visions encompass future events for the entire region. A very common pattern in biblical literature is followed here: the 3+1 pattern, where the fourth element is climactic.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The narrative ends with Balaam and Balak returning home, the latter’s mission having failed. No additional words are exchanged between the Moabite king and the seer.

   that was interrupted by the insertion of the story of Balaam and Balak. It recounts a specific event that occurs while Israel is still encamped on the plains of Moab, awaiting the crossing into Canaan. According to the account, which is apparently woven from different traditions, a group of Israelite men mingle with local non-Israelite women; the resulting sexual relationships lead to idolatrous worship of the local god, Baal-peor, and ultimately to the slaughter of thousands of people.

   Memory of Israel’s apostasy at Baal-peor and subsequent punishment is preserved in several biblical accounts outside the book of Numbers (see
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_4.1-40">
    Deuteronomy 4:3
   </a>
   ; Joshua 22:17; Hosea 9:10; Psalm 106:28). But it is the account in Numbers that specifically develops the theme of the dangerous foreign woman who entices the men to sin (as in Proverbs 2:16; 5:3, 20; 7:5; 23:27; 27:13). Except for Hosea 9:10, all other references to the sin of Baal-peor focus solely on the idolatrous worship.

   ISRAEL’S FLIRTATION WITH FOREIGN WOMEN AND IDOLATRY (25:1–5)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The setting of this episode is the last Israelite encampment outside Canaan, at Shittim—just east of the Jordan River. Israel’s apostasy, actually involving only males, centers around their contact with Moabite women, whom the writer clearly condemns in keeping with a strand of biblical ideology that prohibits marriage with foreign women (see
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#chap-fn1-4a">
    Deuteronomy 7:3
   </a>
   ). King Solomon himself is condemned for marrying foreign women, among them a Moabite, because they ostensibly enticed him to worship foreign gods (I Kings 11:1–6). A contrasting tradition, which welcomes a foreign woman, is the story of Ruth the Moabite. The brief story of Israel’s apostasy in
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_25.1-9">
    Numbers 25
   </a>
   moves swiftly from a sexual encounter to idolatrous worship and God’s reprisal.

    </b>
   </i>
   The Moabite women in this account are viewed as dangerous enticers. Unlike Ruth, who is accepted into Israelite society and even identified as the ancestor of King David (Ruth 4:17), Moabite women in this parashah are considered totally unacceptable partners for the Israelite men. Undoubtedly, Ruth’s complete break with her own family and religion and total adoption of Israelite culture differentiates her case.

   The text makes it clear that it is the Moabite women who entice the Israelite men to join their ritual feast. In that way this sin differs from the one of the Golden Calf, whose construction and worship was initiated by Israel (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e32">
    Exodus 32:1–6
   </a>
   ). [While the case of the Golden Calf implicates women and men alike, the present story singles out women as enticers to sin, while it labels men as sinners. —

   The ringleaders, in Hebrew “heads of the people,” are to be put to death; perhaps included are those who did not take part in the apostasy but were liable for the people’s actions nonetheless.

   Punishing offenders by a divinely sent plague is known from elsewhere in the Bible. (Presumably any remaining members of the Exodus generation are among the victims of this plague, since the census that will follow shortly in
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_25.19-26.65">
    Numbers 26
   </a>
   indicates that by that point they have all been wiped out.) The sin of the Golden Calf, especially, is a comparable example (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#chap-fn35-2">
    Exodus 32:35
   </a>
   ). Possibly, the reference at the end of that account to future divine reprisal (
   <a href="45_chapter_42.xhtml#num32-34">
    32:34
   </a>
   ) is fulfilled by the punishment exacted now at Baal-peor.

    N THE BRIEF
   </small>
   and gruesome episode at the conclusion of
   <i>
    parashat Balak
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#num25-6">
    25:6–9
   </a>
   ), what do the Israelite man and the Midianite woman do to provoke Phinehas’s wrath? Apparently it is the brazenness of an Israelite leader engaging in idolatrous worship with the daughter of a Midianite chieftain within the sight of the whole community that causes Phinehas’s immediate, violent reaction. But the text raises a number of questions and gives a few hints that something else may have incited his brutal response as well.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   First, the priestly author mentions that the man brought the woman (identified in the next parashah respectively as Zimri and Cozbi), to
   <i>
    echav,
   </i>
   translated here as “his companions” (
   <a href="#num25-6">
    v. 6
   </a>
   ). The term
   <i>
    ach
   </i>
   is a kinship term, often translated as “brother” or more loosely as “kin.” If, following Ibn Ezra, we translate
   <i>
    echav
   </i>
   as “kinsmen,” then it appears that Zimri is introducing Cozbi to his family. Then they step into the
   <i>
    kubbah,
   </i>
   a word that appears nowhere else in the Bible, here translated as “chamber” (
   <a href="#num25-8">
    v. 8
   </a>
   ). If they are simply going there to engage in idolatry, why would he have introduced her to his family? Second, why does Phinehas kill both Zimri and Cozbi, when Moses commanded to kill only the Israelites who were engaging in idolatry (
   <a href="#num25-4">
    v. 4
   </a>
   )? Third, why does the author include the detail that Phinehas stabs both Zimri and Cozbi in the belly (
   <a href="#num25-8">
    v. 8
   </a>
   ) if their crime is worshipping foreign gods?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   One explanation that answers all of these questions is that the author conveys through these details that Zimri has married Cozbi, and that they come to the Israelite camp so that he can introduce his bride to his family. Thus, the
   <i>
    kubbah
   </i>
   is a marriage canopy where the couple goes to consummate the marriage. Therefore, the issue is also intermarriage, not only idolatry.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   If this interpretation is correct, then the recounting of this incident reflects an attitude toward intermarriage that conflicts with other biblical stories. Possibly the report about Moses’ own wife Zipporah, which states that she was a Midianite woman and a priest’s daughter, aims specifically to illustrate a different perspective toward foreign women (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E2-16">
    Exodus 2:16–21
   </a>
   ; see also how Zipporah rescues Moses from death in
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E4-24">
    Exodus 4:24–26
   </a>
   ). The book of Ruth, where a Moabite woman becomes the progenitor of King David, likewise challenges an exclusionary perspective.

   <a href="45_chapter_42.xhtml#chap-fn15-2-5">
    Numbers 31:16
   </a>
   (not in this parashah). The Rabbis affirm that Balaam had great prophetic powers and the facility to bless and curse effectively. According to Midrash
   <i>
    B’midbar Rabbah
   </i>
   14.20, God bestowed these special abilities on Balaam so that the nations of the world should not say: “Had we possessed a prophet like Moses we [too] would have worshipped the blessed Holy One.” Thus,
   <a id="page_955">

   recounts that during all the years in the wilderness, the Israelites acted virtuously; they did not commit any sexual sins until they came to Shittim. The reason for their lapse, according to the midrash, was the waters of the local spring: “Some fountains produce strong men and some weaklings, some handsome men and some ugly men, some chaste men and some men who are steeped in lewdness.” According to the Sages, this fountain of Shittim, which promoted immoral sexual behavior, was also the fountain that provided the water for Sodom. They predicted that at some future time God would cause this cursed spring to dry up and then renew it in purity, as the prophet Joel predicted, “A spring shall issue from the House of
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">

    Genesis 19:33–35

   ), following the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Sages usually treat this event positively, since the two daughters believed that the rest of the world had been destroyed and they were trying to reconstitute humanity by sleeping with their father. In
   <i>
    B’midbar Rabbah
   </i>
   20.23, however, this act of incest is cited as the beginning of a history of debauchery by the women of Moab: “Cast a staff into the air, and it will fall back to its place of origin.

   <a href="45_chapter_42.xhtml#chap-fn15-2-5">
    Numbers 31:16
   </a>
   states in the next parashah. In order to ensnare Israel, Balaam advised Balak to erect stalls where old women would offer linen garments to the Israelite men. However, inside the stalls, young women offered to sell the same items for less. Having established a relationship with a particular man, the young woman would say to him: “You are now like one of the family…. Why is it that though we love you, you hate us?…. Are we not all the children of one man, Terah the father of Abraham?” She would then encourage him to drink wine, and he would desire her—as it says in the Prophets, “Harlotry, wine, and new wine destroy the mind of My people” (Hosea 4:11). At that point, the young woman would refuse to have sexual relations with the Israelite man until he had sacrificed an animal and bowed down to the local idol, Baal-peor.

   20.24 suggests that Moses and the Israelite leaders were weeping because they were so shocked and disappointed at the behavior of the Israelite men who were worshiping Baal-peor. The midrash offers a parable: “It is like a king’s daughter, adorned for her wedding and sitting in her bridal litter, who was discovered in a compromising position with a stranger, and so the king and her relatives lost faith in her. It was the same with Israel. At the end of forty years they camped by the Jordan to cross over into the Land of Israel…and there they gave way to harlotry. [At this betrayal] the courage of Moses failed him, as did that of the righteous with him.”

    N THE MIDST
   </small>
   of our book of wandering, we read of how a Moabite sovereign engages a seer from a distant land in the hopes of cursing and thus defeating the Israelites. In the central irony of a fanciful tale that opens with “[he] saw” (
   <a href="#num_22.2-41">
    22:2
   </a>
   ), neither King Balak nor his hireling Balaam are able to “see” the Israelites. Balaam and Balak position and re-position themselves in an attempt to assess the multitude that “hides the earth from view” (
   <a href="#num22-5">
    22:5
   </a>
   ). The two travel from point to point without gaining the perspective they seek.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Only when the Holy One opens his eyes can Balaam see more than a portion of the people he has been sent to curse. He sees the tents that are the homes and the gathering places of the women, children, and men who live as a community marked by care and mutual respect. Seemingly stunned by his newfound perspective on the Israelite compound, Balaam describes the people in language that evokes Eden: “Like palm-groves that stretch out, / Like gardens beside a river, / Like aloes planted by
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   , / Like cedars beside the water; / Their boughs drip with moisture, / Their roots have abundant water” (
   <a href="#num24-6">
    24:6–7
   </a>
   ). Have the eyes of the desert diviner cleared sufficiently so that he can see a people who one day would have the power to make the desert bloom? Do his words reflect dreams of cities with palm-lined boulevards and garden neighborhoods that would, in the future, challenge and transform the arid landscape?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   For a moment, Balaam sees a community as it can be: a society of mutual dependence and trust, a community where each person is treated with dignity, and he exclaims:
   <i>
    Mah tovu ohalecha, Yaakov
   </i>
   /
   <i>
    mishk’notecha, Yisrael
   </i>
   (“How fair are your tents, O Jacob, / Your dwellings, O Israel”;
   <a href="#num24-5">
    24:5
   </a>
   ). But when Balaam extends his description, the utopian vision fades, and the people become just like any other who seek domination over their foes. He concludes, “Blessed are they who bless you, / Accursed they who curse you!” (
   <a href="#num24-9">
    24:9
   </a>
   ). As in the beginning of this portion, the world is divided into two: those who seek to maintain power, and those who attempt to usurp it—the victors and the vanquished, the blessed and the cursed.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The concluding story of this portion (
   <a href="#num_25.1-9">
    25:1–9
   </a>
   ) illustrates the tragedy of seeing the world dichotomized in this way. Exhausted from a journey that seems to have no end, the Israelite men forget who they are. They forget their privileged relationship with the One who brought them out of slavery.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   Balaam’s recognition of Israel’s goodness has become part of our liturgy known as the
   <i>
    Mah tovu
   </i>
   (literally “how good are”):
   <i>
    Mah tovu ohalecha, Yaakov
   </i>
   /
   <i>
    mishk’notecha, Yisrael
   </i>
   (“How fair are your tents, O Jacob, / Your dwellings, O Israel!”). The Rabbis who created our liturgy recognized the power of this sentence, and so they intentionally positioned it as the opening of a daily prayer sequence that fixes the individual in the context of the community of Israel. They expand Balaam’s blessing with four verses from Psalms written in the first person. In so doing, they enable each worshipper to claim a place as a member of the collective.
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   I, through Your abundant love, enter Your house;
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   I bow down in awe at Your holy temple (Psalm 5:8).
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   , I love Your temple abode,
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   <a id="page_957">
   </a>
   The dwelling-place of Your glory (Psalm 26:8).
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   Let me bow down and kneel before God my maker (Psalm 95:6).
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   As for me, may my prayer come to You, O

    יהוה

   ,
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   At a favorable moment;
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   O God, in Your abundant faithfulness,
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   Answer me with Your sure deliverance (Psalm 69:14).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en" style="margin-top:1em;">
   With these phrases, the Rabbis transform Balaam’s God of war into a God of
   <i>
    chesed.
   </i>
   (loving-kindness), and each Jew who utters these words becomes the prayer. In the parashah, Balaam follows his original utterance of the verse with two descriptions of Israel: an Israel that lives in a lush and verdant world, and a nation that is victorious against enemies. But Balaam’s utterance is also incomplete, which is why our liturgy expands it—and also shifts the focus to the relationship of the individual with God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   I propose a third reading, one that returns to the evocation of the community as a source of power and that extends it, connecting the people with God and with their unique challenge.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-eninb">
   Consider the following combination of
   <a href="#num24-5">
    24:5
   </a>
   with the words from the book of Isaiah:
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   How fair are your tents, O Jacob,
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   Your dwelling places, O Israel! (
   <a href="#num24-5">
    24:5
   </a>
   )
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   I, the Holy One, have called you in righteousness,
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   and taken you by the hand.
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   I am the One who created you
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   and made you a covenant people,
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   a light to the nations:
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   to open eyes that are blind,
  </div>
  <div class="hang">
   to bring the captive out of confinement (Isaiah 42:6–7).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en" style="margin-top:1em;">
   This clear challenge invites us to move beyond the narrow, dichotomous thinking that blinded Balak and Balaam in this portion. These verses from Isaiah anticipate—and fulfill—the subsequent prophetic call about tents and dwellings: “Enlarge the space for your tent (
   <i>
    oholech
   </i>
   ); / do not spare the canvas for your dwelling place (
   <i>
    mishk’notayich
   </i>
   )” (Isaiah 54:2). Here the prophet urges Jerusalem—personified as a woman—to widen her tent with joy and make room for the multitudes who will enter the capital city. An expanded tent in a gracious and open city reflects the utopian and achievable goal of moving beyond oppositional concepts of native/stranger, friend/foe, chosen/rejected, male/female.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Are we ready to open our tents and our hearts to those who wish to dream—and then to build sacred communities that not only tolerate diversity and difference but also celebrate them? Can we move beyond narrow, divisive definitions and descriptions that are no longer useful? Might we transform our communities by welcoming those who come into our houses of worship with words that describe what our community can be? When our dwelling places become sanctuaries for all seekers of peace and justice, when our homes welcome all who no longer objectify the other, then we can truthfully declare,
   <i>
    Mah tovu
   </i>
   —how good, how fair, are our tents.
