<div class="chap2" id="ch-4"><i>Between Laughter and Tears
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYEIRA</small> (“[he] appeared”) describes several encounters between God and members of Abraham’s household. In one sense, this parashah recounts the birth and survival of the next generation, Isaac and Rebekah: it begins with the announcement of Sarah’s forthcoming pregnancy and Isaac’s forthcoming birth (Genesis 18), continues with the challenges that stand in the way of the future, and concludes with Rebekah, Isaac’s future wife (22:20–24).
</div><div class="tab-en1">Questions of identity and self-definition continue, as covenantal blessings demarcate the distinction between Sarah and Isaac on the one hand, and Hagar and Ishmael on the other. A subtext concerns Abraham’s role in fulfilling God’s plan. But the individual episodes do more than chart the hazards and successes that follow God’s promises of progeny and land (see the previous parashah). Rather, they vividly depict the challenges, anguish, and joy that human beings experience as they create families and discover the complexities of multiple commitments.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The most famous of these episodes is the “Binding of Isaac,” where Abraham is asked to sacrifice his beloved son (Genesis 22). This story has its counterpart in that of a mother with an imperiled child: the heart-wrenching story of Hagar and Ishmael in the wilderness (Genesis 21), in which Hagar despairs of her son’s survival. Women are prominent through-out. At long last Sarah learns that she shall have a son (Genesis 18), and finally becomes a mother (Genesis 21). Tension between two mothers—Sarah and Hagar—each one seeking the welfare of her child, frames the story of Lot’s daughters, who act together (Genesis 19). These tales offer glimpses into women’s world and presumed concerns. The closing report about Rebekah’s birth far from the land of Canaan sets the stage for when she becomes Isaac’s wife (in the next parashah).

It is the hottest part of the day and she is expected to do the baking. Is this because Abraham recognizes the importance of these visitors and Sarah’s involvement raises the level of the meal? (On women as bakers, see at Exodus 16:3 and Leviticus 26:26.)</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="18:9–10 “Where is your wife Sarah?” “There, in the tent”" ref="18:9"><b></b> The visitor knows of Abraham’s wife Sarah, asks where she is, and continues speaking in her hearing.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="18:10"><b>“at this time next year…your wife Sarah shall have a son.”</b> Since Abraham already knows that Sarah will have a son (17:16–19), the annunciation seems to be primarily for her benefit.<br></br><i><b>Sarah was listening.</b></i> For the first time, Sarah learns about her forthcoming pregnancy. Some use this verse to criticize Sarah for listening to other people’s conversations. But the speaker has asked specifically about Sarah, speaks knowing her proximity, and has information specifically designated for her. Clearly she is his audience.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="18:11"><b>the way of women had ceased for Sarah.</b> Sarah no longer menstruates, also meaning that she can no longer conceive. The reference highlights for the reader why she will be surprised by what she hears. [Rachel also refers to menstruation as “the way of women” (Genesis 31:35). See at Leviticus 15:19–24 for details about menstruation. —<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="18:12"><b>Sarah laughed inwardly.</b> Sarah, alone in the tent, responds with no outward sign—as opposed to Abraham, who fell on his face, laughing aloud, while he was in conversation with the Deity (17:17).<br></br><i><b>“pleasure.”</b></i> The word <i>ednah</i> is related to the word “Eden” (as in the Garden of Eden), alluding to a sense of “delight,” with a sexual connotation. Sarah is excited by the thought of an impending sexual encounter.<br></br><i><b>“with my lord so old!”</b></i> Sarah’s reaction reflects her delighted surprise in her husband’s abilities. God suggests a different reason (v. 13). This implies that Abraham and Sarah had stopped sexual relations, highlighting why the visitors inform her that the couple should renew them. Sarah does not doubt the Deity’s abilities, but rather Abraham’s.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="18:13"><b>“Why is Sarah laughing so.”</b> Some interpreters have concluded, erroneously, that Sarah’s laughter was derisive. When Abraham heard that he would have a child with Sarah, he “fell flat on his face and laughed, thinking: ‘Can a child be born to a man of 100? Can 90-year-old Sarah bear a child?’” (17:17). Thus Sarah is actually now accused of Abraham’s earlier actions. Since Sarah is alone in the tent when she laughs, is the Deity testing Abraham to determine if he will admit his own actions and protect Sarah? | [Tikva Frymer-Kensky, who considers Sarah’s laughter as an expression of doubt, interprets God’s response to Sarah this way: “God ignores Abraham’s laughter but reacts to Sarah’s. After all, Sarah should understand how important she is.…Sarah’s importance in God’s scheme means that God will have zero tolerance for skepticism from her” (<i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 151). <i>—Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="18:15"><b>Sarah…was afraid.</b> Whom does Sarah fear? Most interpreters assume that Sarah is afraid of God. I contend that she fears Abraham. Sarah has no reason to fear God—who apparently comes to her rescue (in the house of the pharaoh, 12:10–18), blesses her and promises that she shall have a child (17:15–16), and has now sent messengers to tell her that she shall soon have her desired son. However, she does have reasons for fearing Abraham. He does not seem to object when she is taken to Pharaoh’s palace (12:14–16); he allows Hagar to treat her with disrespect (16:3–4); and—insofar as the reader knows—has not informed her that they will be having a child.<br></br>[God] said, “Ah, but you did laugh!” The present translation adds “God” in brackets because the speaker is unnamed. The grammar supports the interpretation that the speaker is not God but Abraham (for details, see Tammi J. Schneider, <i>Sarah: Mother of Nations,</i> 2004, pp. 70–74). Another reason for doubting that God speaks here is that the Deity never speaks with Sarah before or after. And throughout 18:1–14 she is hidden from the visitors’ sight, but not from Abraham’s. Thus it is likely that it is Abraham who speaks these words, even though he has not heard her laugh.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="18:16–33" ref="18:16"><b></b> The story of Abraham’s attempted defense of Sodom follows directly the one in which he accuses his wife of his own actions.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="18:23"><b></b> Abraham asks a daring question of God.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="18:33"><b>his place.</b> Either his dwelling-place (see v. 16), or his proper place of obeying—rather than debating with—the Deity.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="19:5"><div class="head2" id="ge_19.1-38">DIVINE MESSENGERS VISIT SODOM AND LOT, AND LOT’S DAUGHTERS BECOME MOTHERS OF NATIONS (19:1–38)<br></br>The visit to Sodom is a “test” of sorts (note Genesis 22) to determine the worthiness of the city and of Lot. Sodom has been mentioned several times already, and never positively (Genesis 1314). Lot and his family are a major focus of this section. Since the parashah concerns establishing the next generation, and Lot is the nephew of Abraham and potential heir, then an evaluation of Lot is critical. [The story of Lot’s daughters and their incestuous intercourse with their father (19:30–38) possibly seeks to account for why Isaac does not marry one of them, who as his nearby cousins would otherwise be prime candidates. —<i>Ed.</i>]
</div><b>“so we can have them.”</b> Literally, “so we can know them,” which carries a sexual connotation (see at 4:1).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="19:8"><b></b> Lot offers his daughters instead of the men. His effort to protect the visitors reflects his belief that male rape is worse than female rape, even of his own daughters. | Here, angels will save the women; in a similar incident in Judges 19, another woman is not so fortunate when she and her husband visit and she is offered in lieu of him to a mob. She is repeatedly molested by the mob and dies soon after.

Fearful that humankind has been annihilated, the daughters (the same ones whom Lot offered to the town’s men earlier?) take drastic measures to perpetuate life.

Their sons produce the nations Moab and Ammon, Israel’s eastern neighbors.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="19:31"><b></b> The daughters are living in a cave and think they are the only ones on earth.

His actions here are more problematic both because he has done it before, and because his wife is supposed to bear him a child soon.
</div><b>Abraham said, of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.”</b> In the earlier case, Abraham had been propelled by hunger, and by fear for his life on account of Sarah’s beauty (12:10–13).

Both Sarah’s and Abraham’s genealogy appear in 11:27–30, where this fact is not mentioned; see the comment there. The earlier episode (12:10–18) contains no reference to a real brother/sister relationship; if Abraham and Sarah were truly brother and sister, the perfect opportunity to mention it would have been then, before they entered Egypt. Yet unlike Isaac, who claims that his wife and first cousin Rebekah is his sister (26:1–11), Abraham here provides plausible specifics: he and Sarah are related through their father.

</div><div class="head1">TWO MOTHERS CLASH PROTECTING THEIR SONS (21:8–21)
</div><div class="tab-en">The tension in the family does not end with Isaac’s birth, since there are potential threats to his longevity and success from both his brother and his father.
</div><div class="tab-en1">One of the most poignant parts of the parashah is the story of two mothers, each of whom desires the well-being of her son. Mother Sarah seeks to secure her infant’s future (a future that she will probably not live to see, given her age) by expelling a rival. Hagar then faces the near death of her son. The Torah is sympathetic to both mothers caught in the cross-currents.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The plight here of mother Hagar and son Ishmael will be mirrored by that of father Abraham and his son Isaac in the story immediately following. Certain details connect the stories: In both, the parent rises early, a child is imperiled; and a divine messenger intervenes at the last moment. (Both stories are read on Rosh HaShanah in traditional synagogues.)
</div><div class="head2" id="ge_vv.8-13">SARAH SEEKS TO PROTECT ISAAC: THE EXPULSION OF HAGAR AND ISHMAEL (21:8–13)
</div><b>on Isaac’s weaning day.</b> I Samuel 1:23 and II Maccabees 7:27 indicate that in ancient Israel, children were weaned at about three years of age.<br></br><i><b>great feast.</b></i> Weaning apparently was marked by a ritual, the details of which have not been preserved. This life-passage is obviously significant to mother and child.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="21:9"><b>Sarah saw the son…playing.</b> Ishmael’s precise action is at issue. All we know for sure is that it triggers a severe reaction in Sarah. The word <i>m’tzachek</i> (“playing”) puns on the name Isaac (<i>yitzchak</i>). It can also mean “mocking,” “fooling around,” and toying with him sexually.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="21:10"><b>“Throw this slave girl and her son out.”</b> [From a feminist perspective, the call for the expulsion of Hagar raises troubling questions. The story portrays the oppression of one woman by another; it also places responsibility for the enmity between two peoples—the descendants of Isaac and those of Ishmael—upon women, especially Sarah. As a story about domestic relations, the narrative builds sympathy for Hagar at Sarah’s expense. Some scholars respond by pointing out that Sarah’s concern is legitimate. As an old woman she anticipates her young son’s vulnerable position in the event of her death. She takes steps to protect him by removing the competition for Abraham’s possessions—and possibly also for his affection. Rather than casting a human drama in simplistic terms, the story of Sarah, Hagar, and Abraham poignantly illustrates the dilemma of multiple commitments. Among other things, this passage may seek to sensitize the reader to the plight of the outsider. —<i>Ed.</i>]<br></br><i><b>“The son of this slave girl is not going to share in the inheritance.”</b></i> Sarah raises inheritance as the issue, stressing meanwhile that Hagar is a slave. In 17:19, God had earmarked Isaac to receive the covenantal promise, and perhaps Sarah is acting with that knowledge. Ancient law collections from Mesopotamia address inheritance in similar cases, illustrating ancient customs that may lie in the background of this story. In the collection of Lipit Ishtar, the status of the second wife determines whether or not her son inherits. In the collection of Hammurabi, a child of a slave inherits only if the father claims him. The sons of Zilpah and Bilhah—women of a status similar to Hagar—do later inherit along with the children of the primary wives, Leah and Rachel. Perhaps Sarah objects to such an arrangement because her son is so young and she may not be around to protect him.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="21:11"><b>This grieved Abraham greatly, on account of his son.</b> The text does not clarify what “this” is, or specify which son he refers to; therefore what bothers Abraham is open to interpretation. One might suppose here that Abraham is not concerned about Hagar, but God’s response in the next verse (“do not be grieved…over your slave”) implies otherwise.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="21:12"><b>“Do whatever Sarah tells you,”</b> Abraham is instructed to obey his wife, literally “whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her voice.” In 3:17 the man was chastised for listening to his wife’s voice. [God’s rebuke in 3:17 might lead readers to conclude that listening to a wife’s voice is wrong. God’s instruction in the present passage illustrates that this is not the case. —<i>Ed.</i>] | God supports Sarah’s concern about inheritance. Abraham’s distrust that the Deity will care for both his sons may be the background for the Deity’s decision to test Abraham in the episode that follows this story of Ishmael.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="21:14"><div class="head2" id="ge_vv.14-21">THE RESCUE OF HAGAR AND ISHMAEL IN THE DESERT (21:14–21)<br></br>Once again, Hagar is in the wilderness (compare 16:7–14). Earlier, she had been pregnant with Ishmael and had left of her own accord. This time she has her son on her back and is sent away.
</div><b>Early next morning, Abraham got up.</b> Though not translated identically here, these words in Hebrew are the same as in 22:3, where Abraham rises to sacrifice Isaac. The common phrasing connects the two episodes, both of which deal with the potential death of a son of Abraham.<br></br><i><b>took bread and a waterskin and handed them to Hagar, placing them and the boy on her shoulder.</b></i> Placing the child on Hagar’s back hints that Ishmael is a small child, though, according to the preceding notices (17:23–25; 21:5, 8), Ishmael at this point is at least fifteen years of age. The narrator uses poetic license to depict Ishmael as younger and more vulnerable to make the scene more poignant.<br></br><i><b>cast her out.</b></i> [The verb is used for divorce but more literally means “sent her out.” It will be used when Pharaoh lets the Israelites go from slavery (Exodus 13:17). Tikva Frymer-Kensky points out that Hagar and Ishmael are not sold and suggests that they are freed. They leave Abraham’s household as emancipated slaves (<i>Reading the Women of the Bible,</i> 2002, p. 235).

This parashah ends with Isaac safe, and with his future wife born to the right woman from the right lineage. Rebekah, the matriarch for the next generation, appears immediately before the previous one, Sarah, dies. This passage emphasizes the women in the lineage and highlights the importance of women in the “patriarchal” line of the people of Israel. On the role of women in the Israelite lineage, see also at 17:19, 22.
</div><b>Milcah.</b> We were told of her marriage to Nahor when she was first introduced with Sarai (11:29), before Abram’s household left the city of Haran for Canaan. Now she is mentioned again—and once more in verse 23—just before Sarah dies (23:1–2). Rebekah will also mention her grandmother Milcah when she identifies herself (24:24, 47). It is not clear why Milcah merits her relative prominence.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="22:23"><b>Bethuel fathered Rebekah.</b> The text highlights only Rebekah in her generation.

Here it seems to represent an Aramean people who lived east of the Jordan (see Deuteronomy 3:14; <i>The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, pp. xxii–xxiv).

Women are constructed largely as sexual objects and procreative instruments with mostly a physical and corporeal relationship to the story of threatened birth and threatened survival. The two wife-sister episodes—in Genesis 12:10–20 and (in our parashah) 20:2–18—present Sarai/Sarah as a silent object of desire. Sarah is taken by Abimelech, king of Gerar, and later returned to her husband—as, one may say, a possession—while her husband is amply compensated for the king’s error. In her role as barren wife, she is a figure discussed by, rather than addressed directly by, God, who questions her skeptical laughter (18:12–14). The announcement of a male child is not transmitted by God to Sarah, but rather to Abraham, as she eavesdrops on the conversation at the entrance of the tent (18:10). As a mother, however, Sarah is validated by God, who advises Abraham to obey her demand that her rival, Hagar, and Hagar’s son, Ishmael, be removed from the household (21:12). Yet, beyond her protective role as mother, Sarah is neither consulted nor even mentioned in the story of the great test of faith that Abraham endures when God asks him to sacrifice his one and only remaining son at the altar (22:1–19).</div><div class="tab-en1">It can be argued, then, that in this parashah the mother’s role is limited to procreation, nurturance, and physical protectiveness. Sarah, in fact, disappears from the story as soon as Abraham is rewarded for the successful test and blessed with future progeny (22:16–19). Still, as God makes clear, it is Sarah’s son, not merely Abraham’s, who is God’s chosen. Stories about Hagar and Ishmael, and about Lot’s daughters, continue the theme of threatened survival in which women ensure the safety of the next generation: God responds to Hagar’s cry for help (21:15–21); Lot’s daughters, who first appear as silent sexual objects, and whose procreative role is temporarily threatened (19:1–8), daringly initiate incestuous sexual relations with their father and secure generational continuity (19:30–38).</div><div class="right1">—<i>Esther Fuchs</i>

In Genesis 18:12, Sarah’s laughter at the prediction that she would soon bear a child was prompted as much by her husband’s advanced age as her own. According to Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 48.18 and BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 87a, however, God’s query omitted Sarah’s reference to Abraham’s age so as to preserve good will between husband and wife, demonstrating that truth may be compromised for the sake of peace. The Rabbis also noted that Sarah was the only woman to whom God spoke directly, on account of her righteousness. When God spoke to Hagar or Rebekah, it was through an angel or an intermediary (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 48.20).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>his wife looked behind him and became a pillar of salt</b></i> (19:26). According to one midrashic tradition, Lot’s wife turned around to ensure that her daughters were still following—and inadvertently beheld the <i>Shechinah,</i> who had descended to rain fire and brimstone on Sodom <i>(Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 25).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>God restored Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves, and they bore children</b></i> (20:17). The Rabbis appreciated Sarah’s discomfort after Abimelech’s wife and even his slave girls gave birth. The angels cried out to God on Sarah’s behalf, claiming that it was only just that she too bear a child (<i>P’sikta Rabbati 42).</i> In other texts, the conception of Isaac is attributed to Sarah’s enduring trust in God during this painful episode <i>(B’reishit Rabbah</i> 53.3).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><b>יהוה</b> <i><b>now remembered Sarah</b></i> (21:1). According to <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 53.8 and <i>P’sikta Rabbati</i> 42, God rejoiced in Isaac’s birth by showering gifts on the whole of Creation: infertile women gave birth; the blind were granted sight; the deaf could now hear; and the insane became sane. God was so exultant that the sun shone forth with a full radiant splendor not seen since Creation.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>Sarah shall nurse children</b></i> (21:7). [The plural noun is surprising, given that Sarah has only one son. Rabbi Levi read this rhetorical flourish as a sign that Sarah had surplus milk and nursed others’ children as well (BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 87a). —<i>Ed</i>.]
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>Now Sarah saw the son…playing</b></i> (21:9). Citing a series of verses linked by multiple usages of <i>m’tzachek</i> (“playing”), the Rabbis defend Sarah’s culpability in the expulsions of Hagar and Ishmael by suggesting that Ishmael was actually “making sport” by seducing women, engaging in idolatrous practices, and even threatening Isaac by shooting arrows in his direction. These activities border on the three most serious public offenses in Jewish law: idolatry, rape, and murder. The Rabbis explained that God told Abraham to listen to Sarah’s demand to expel Hagar and Ishmael because her perceptions were inspired by prophecy (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 14a; BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 69b; <i>Seder Olam Rabbah 2).</i>
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>God heard the boy’s cry</b></i> (21:17). The midrash notes that God answered Ishmael although it was Hagar who cried out. This is because “sick persons’ prayers on their own behalf are more efficacious than those of anyone else” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 53.14).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>God then opened her eyes, and she saw a well</b></i> (21:19). This was said to be Miriam’s Well, created on the eve of the first Shabbat of Creation (<i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 30). Rabbi Benjamin suggested that the phraseology of the text teaches that “All are blind until God brings light to their eyes” (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 53.19).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>After these things</b></i> (22:1). <i>Sefer HaYashar, parashat Vayeira,</i> suggests that when God commanded Abraham to offer up his son, Abraham masked his intentions and informed Sarah that he was taking Isaac to study with the sages. Sarah agreed but begged Abraham to protect Isaac on the journey and not to keep him away for long, “for his soul is bound up with mine.”
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>after all these things</b></i> (22:20). Strikingly, Sarah is never mentioned in Genesis 22, but Genesis 23 will begin with her death. This juxtaposition led to the tradition that when Sarah learned that Abraham planned to offer Isaac as a sacrifice to God, she died of grief, thinking her son dead (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 58.5). Other versions suggest that when Satan (or the demon Samael) told Sarah that Isaac had been sacrificed, she began to weep and cried aloud three times, corresponding to the shofar’s three sustained notes (<i>t’kiah</i>) on Rosh HaShanah, followed by three laments corresponding to the three disconnected short notes (<i>t’ruah).</i> Her soul then fled and she died (<i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 32). According to others, Sarah died of shock when she learned that Isaac had actually survived (<i>Tanchuma</i> on <i>Vayeira</i> 23; <i>Midrash HaGadol).</i>

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano4-1"><div class="tab-en">T<small>HIS EXTRAORDINARILY RICH PARASHAH</small> is filled with violence—not just the obvious and dramatic violence of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the incipient violence of the binding of Isaac, but also various, more ordinary, forms of violence against women. Half-buried in the vivid description of the people of Sodom gathering around Lot’s house and demanding the strangers staying with him is Lot’s reply, “Look—I have two daughters who have never been intimate with a man; let me bring them out for you, and do to them as you please. But do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof” (19:8). While a later midrash will see Lot’s offer as evidence that he was infected by the wickedness of Sodom and picture him as having been punished (<i>Tanchuma Vayeira</i> 12), the biblical text offers no explicit judgment on his behavior. The violence of the people of Sodom merits the destruction of the city, but the willingness of Lot to see his daughters assaulted and raped is apparently unworthy of comment.
</div><div class="tab-en1">At the beginning of Genesis 20, we have another form of violence: the second of two stories (or two versions of the same story; see 12:10–20) in which Abraham seeks to pass off his wife Sarah as his sister in order to protect himself. In this passage, Abimelech, king of Gerar, seizes Sarah, but her potential rape is averted when God keeps Abimelech from touching her. The similar tale will be repeated once again in relation to Isaac and Rebekah (26:6–11). The three-fold reiteration of the narrative suggests that it might serve as a paradigm of the situation of Jewish women. The first two male ancestors of the Jews, perceiving themselves as “other” and therefore endangered in foreign lands, use their wives as buffers between themselves and the larger culture. The women become the “others’ other,” the ones whose safety and well-being can be sacrificed in order to save the patriarchs’ skins. The story names a pattern that becomes a recurring part of Jewish history: male Jews, subordinated by the dominant culture, in turn subordinate women within their own cultures, doubling the otherness that partly mirrors their own. As in the case of Lot’s offering his daughters to the people of Sodom, the biblical text offers no comment on or protest against this situation. Unlike when God appears to Abimelech in a dream and threatens him with death unless he releases Sarah (Genesis 12), God does not explicitly chastise Abraham or Lot.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Then, in Genesis 21, we meet still another form of violence—this time Sarah’s violence against Hagar. After Sarah bears Isaac in her old age, she tells Abraham to throw the slave girl Hagar and her son Ishmael out of the house, so that Ishmael will not share in his father’s inheritance along with Isaac. The violence that is practiced by Abraham against Sarah, she now recapitulates in relation to the most vulnerable person in her own household. Thus, the cycle of abuse goes on. In this context, not only does the text not judge Sarah, but God is explicitly on her side, telling Abraham to listen to Sarah because her son Isaac will be the bearer of the covenantal line.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">This Torah portion makes clear that our ancestors are by no means always models of ethical behavior that edify and inspire us. On the contrary, often the Torah holds up a mirror to the ugliest aspects of human nature and human society. It provides us with opportunities to look honestly at ourselves and the world we have created, to reflect on destructive patterns of human relating, and to ask how we might address and change them. In Lot’s treatment of his daughters—and in the Torah’s lack of comment on that treatment—can we see the casual acceptance, indeed the invisibility, of violence against women that is so ubiquitous in many cultures, including our own? In Abraham’s seeming lack of concern about the fate of Sarah, can we see the ways in which marginalized peoples are all too liable to duplicate patterns of subordination from which they themselves have suffered? In Sarah’s banishment of Hagar, can we see the horizontal violence that oppressed people visit on each other as they jockey for what seems to them limited resources, rather than making common cause against the forces that suppress them? And what do we do when we see ourselves enacting these patterns in our own personal and political lives? How do we respond to and interrupt them?
</div><div class="tab-en1">It is striking that throughout the portion, God is implicated in the violence in the text. Except in the case of Lot’s willingness to sacrifice his daughters, God carries out or commands the violence (Sodom and Gomorrah; Isaac) or supports it (Abraham and Sarah; Sarah and Hagar). The representations of violence that the text holds up to us are ones on which the human and divine levels mirror each other. There is no cosmic relief, so to speak, from the reality of violence. Abraham’s challenge to God over the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah can thus be seen as a question to both God and ourselves. “Must not the Judge of all the earth do justly?” Abraham asks God. “Will You indeed sweep away the innocent along with the wicked?” (18:23). The implication of these questions is that it is the judge of all the earth who creates the ethical norms that Abraham reflects back to God and to which he holds God answerable. But the moral voice in this passage is Abraham’s voice. What happens to that moral vision two chapters later when Abraham betrays his wife Sarah? Can we read these narratives in ways that strengthen our resolve to hold both ourselves and God accountable to standards of justice that we recognize and value—and yet continually violate?
