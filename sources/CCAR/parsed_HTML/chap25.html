  (“issue a command”) continues with instructions about sacrificial offerings that began in
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">

  . However, whereas
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
   1:1–2
  </a>
  began with instructions to all the people of Israel,
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
   6:1
  </a>
  starts with a command specifically addressed to the priests. The first section of the parashah (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
   Leviticus 6–7
  </a>
  ) contains instructions about the priests’ portions from the sacrificial rituals. The second section (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_8.1-36">
   Leviticus 8
  </a>
  ) records the ordination of the priests.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In establishing a sacrificial system and a professional priesthood, biblical Israel resembled other ancient cultures. One notes, however, two differences. First, priests in most cultures in the ancient world kept the secrets of their profession away from the public eye and transmitted them privately from generation to generation. In contrast, Leviticus reflects a commitment to keep the rules of the trade, as it were, in public view.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  A second difference is that neighboring cultures such as Mesopotamia included women priests (even though they did not perform the same rituals as male priests), whereas the Bible recognizes only male priests. Scholars concur, however, that women played an important role in many facets of popular religion in ancient Israel (as did men), even though the priestly teachings in Leviticus do not acknowledge or discuss such roles.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Although
  <i>
   parashat Tzav
  </i>
  does not mention women explicitly, it treats three areas that do involve women. The first pertains to the roles and possible privileges of women as members of priests’ families. Such women apparently benefit from the priests’ share of sacrificial foods. There is a question, however, whether they may eat the part of the offering designated as “most holy” (see
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#page_608">
   Another View
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The second area concerning women pertains to the highly valued, formal priestly garments (see
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
   Exodus 28
  </a>
  and
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_8.1-36">
   Leviticus 8
  </a>
  ). Archeological and biblical evidence shows that women excelled in weaving, spinning, and sewing (see at
  <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_33.1-36.7">
   Exodus 35:25
  </a>
  ;
  <i>
   T’tzaveh
  </i>
  ,
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#page_489">

  </a>
  ;
  <i>
   P’kudei
  </i>
  ,
  <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#page_560">
   Another View
  </a>
  ). Therefore, we may assume that women made the priestly garments. According to the book of Samuel, each year Hannah made and brought a special garment for her son Samuel who served at the sanctuary at Shiloh (1 Samuel 2:19). Plausibly priests’ mothers and wives likewise made clothing for their family members.

 </div>
 <div class="image0">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The third area to consider is whether women were among those who offered the sacrifices that these passages discuss. Biblical references
  <a id="page_594">
  </a>
  elsewhere do suggest that Israelite women, like Israelite men, worshipped and sacrificed in the shrines—often as part of their households. For example, according to
  <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
   Leviticus 12:6
  </a>
  and
  <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#L15-29">
   15:29
  </a>
  , women are obligated to offer sacrifices after childbirth and irregular bleeding. Proverbs 7:14 presents a female persona who mentions her need to offer the well-being offerings. And in I Samuel 1, Hannah and her husband present and slaughter the offering that she has brought— together with a portion of flour and a jar of wine—to the shrine in Shiloh as payment for a vow.

  Detailed instructions about this offering appeared in

   Leviticus 1
  </a>
  , indicating that the entire animal is to be “turned into smoke” (see

  Whereas Moses is charged with communicating most other laws to the people, here God directs Moses to convey these laws specifically to Aaron and his sons. (Because the laws apply to the priests themselves, it is reasonable to translate the plural noun
  <i>
   banim
  </i>
  here as “sons” rather than as “children.”)

  which more widely means an “instruction” or “teaching” (see the introduction to
  <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_6.1-7.5">
   Deuteronomy 6:20–25
  </a>
  ). Rendered as “Torah” (capitalized), this term comes to represent the entire first five books of the Bible (see at
  <a href="55_chapter_52.xhtml#deu_31.1-13">
   Deuteronomy 31:9

  The fabrics that the “skilled women” wove for the Tabernacle (
  <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_33.1-36.7">

  ) were nearly identical to the material specified for the priestly garments (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
   Exodus 28:5
  </a>
  ). Thus women probably also wove the fabrics for the priestly garments such as those mentioned here. Weaving is one of the household crafts or tasks typically carried out by women in traditional cultures (see

  <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_26.1-37">
   Exodus 26:34

  The translation here restricts eating of this sacrifice to Aaron and his sons. However, if one construes the Hebrew words as “every male” or “all males” (which is how this same translation understands the phrase in 24 out of 27 cases; see, for example,
  <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#num_1.1-54">
   Numbers 1:20

  “These” refers to the
  <i>
   kodesh kodashim
  </i>
  (“most holy”), which in this context means the portion of the offering designated for the priests. This statement conflicts with Haggai 2:12–13, which claims that only impurity, not holiness, is contagious when touched. In either case, the notion of holiness in the Bible can be likened in modern terms to electric energy or radiation, either of which has the power to heal or to kill, depending on how it is handled. Jacob Milgrom uses the analogy of “high voltage” (
  <i>
   Leviticus: A Book of Ritual and Ethics,
  </i>
  2004, p. 64). It is also possible that the statement means that a person must be in a state of purity before touching this offering.

  Vessels in which the meat is prepared must be purified. Since earthenware is porous, it cannot be completely “disinfected” and therefore has to be destroyed; metal vessels, however, can be washed.

  CONCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PRECEDING OFFERINGS (7:7–10)

  This section completes the earlier discussion of these sacrifices by designating explicitly what the priests are to receive in these cases. The officiating priest is to receive the benefit from both purgation and reparation offerings (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#L7-7">
   7:7
  </a>
  ). The animal’s skin goes to the officiating priest in the case of the burnt offering (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#L7-7">
   7:8
  </a>
  ). Presumably that skin would be made into leather used for clothing, footwear, and possibly writing material. One type of meal offering goes only to the officiating priest (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#L7-7">
   7:9
  </a>
  ), whereas the other kind (

  There is no explanation as to why certain offerings (like thanksgiving or well-being offerings) must be eaten entirely on the first day, while others (like votive and freewill offerings, see next verse) can be kept for a couple of days. Health factors do not account for the difference.

  Leftover sacrificial meat must be destroyed by fire when not consumed within the designated time period. Keeping meat for three days in the climactic conditions of Israel would have been a health hazard and may underlie the concern in this case. However, this reason alone cannot explain why the other well-being sacrifice—the one for thanksgiving—cannot be kept even for one day.

  </i>
  This punishment of being “cut off” (Heb.
  <i>
   kareit)
  </i>
  can be understood in a number of ways. The expression could mean that the individual should be ostracized, that is, deliberately excluded from the community. The term could also refer to divinely inflicted childlessness, a condition that in time will “cut” that person’s bloodline from the community (a consequence that does not entail communal punishment). Jacob Milgrom suggests in addition that
  <i>
   kareit
  </i>
  could mean that such a person will not be buried with the ancestors—and thus be denied the kind of reunification that marks a full life (
  <i>
   Leviticus
  </i>
  , 2004, p. 66). There are eighteen cases in the Torah that prescribe
  <i>
   kareit
  </i>
  (see Milgrom, p. 65). The verb form of the root
  <i>
   k-r-t
  </i>
  also appears as the term for making a covenant, such as when God makes a covenant with Abram
  <i>
   (karat…b’rit)

  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L17-11">

  ) is that the life of a living being is in the blood. No explanation is given for not eating the fat. However, references to “fat” elsewhere as especially valuable (for example,
  <a href="14_chapter_11.xhtml#ge_45.1-28">

  This section, addressed to all, describes a division of labor between those who bring the offering and the officiating priest.

  Those making a sacrifice physically bring the offering to the altar. We learn from
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_28.1-30.1a">

  that women make vows, and we learn from
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
   Leviticus 7:16
  </a>
  that vows often entailed making an offering. The present law implies that Israelite women, like Israelite men, would have access to the altar on these occasions if they were in a state of ritual purity. Note the story of Hannah: she vows to dedicate her son; then she brings him to the sanctuary where she also slaughters a sacrifice (I Samuel 1:11, 24–25).

   The Ordination of the Priests

  (8:1–36)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en">
  <span class="dropcap-s">

  </span>
  etailed instructions for the ordination of the priests appeared in
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
   Exodus 28
  </a>
  . The present passage describes the execution of these instructions. The account of the ordination, like that of building the Tabernacle itself, emphasizes that the instructions were carried out precisely (even if some of the details vary slightly). The ceremony entails the formal dressing of Aaron and his four sons. In English, the words “investment” and “investiture” refer (among other things) to the ritual of placing clothing—vestments—upon the priest. (Nowadays the term “invested” also applies to the official status conferred on a cantor, analogous to an “ordained” rabbi.)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Two issues in this section pertain indirectly to women. First, the priesthood in Leviticus is bestowed exclusively upon Aaron and his sons. Although it is common for priests in the ancient world to come from specifically designated families, it is unusual to have only a single family serve exclusively for generations. Moreover, whereas women in ancient Mesopotamia could be priests, the Torah authorizes only males from the line of Aaron to supervise and formally officiate at the communal sanctuary. The reason for this difference is not clear; see
  <i>
   T’tzaveh,
  </i>
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#page_489">
   Another View
  </a>
  . As for the women in priestly families—wives, daughters, and sisters—
  <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
   Leviticus 21–22
  </a>
  indicate that women are beneficiaries of certain privileges and also accountable to special standards (see especially at
  <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#L22-10">
   22:12–13
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Second, the emphasis on the priests’ garments raises the question as to who made (and also who repaired) them. Did women in the priests’ household participate by spinning the yarn, weaving the fabric, and fashioning the garments? The Torah does not provide this information here, but see at
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.3">
   6:3
  </a>
  . What does appear to be important to the writer of these accounts is that the ordination of the priests—rather than other communal events—constitutes a turning point that deserves close attention.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The ordination ceremony includes sacrifices delineated in
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
   Leviticus 1–7

  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#L8-22">
   8:22–24

  ). Such a ritual also marks the purification of a

  The ordination of the priests begins when Moses places upon them their special accoutrements. Only priestly garments, not other clothes, receive an extensive description in the Bible. (Even the book of Esther, with its emphasis on the role of clothing, does not include detailed descriptions of clothes.) On the likelihood that women wove the fabric, see at

  The ordination ritual bestows holiness on the priests. Their isolation, which echoes that of menstruating women or persons isolated for skin disease in
  <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_13.1-59">

   Leviticus 6:11
  </a>
  specifies that “only the males” among Aaron’s descendants may eat of certain sacrifices (rather than “every male”). Why can the females in Aaron’s line not partake of these offerings? What determines which priestly portions are restricted to the sons of Aaron, and which may be shared by his daughters as well?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The answer lies in the degree of holiness of the offering. The biblical text distinguishes between sacrifices considered to be “most sacred” (
  <i>
   kodesh kodashim)
  </i>
  and those considered to be “sacred”
  <i>
   (kodesh).
  </i>
  Three types of offerings fall under the rubric of “most sacred”: the meal offering (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#L6-10">
   6:10
  </a>
  ), the purgation offering (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#L6-18">
   6:18
  </a>
  ) and the reparation offering (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_7.6">
   7:6
  </a>
  ). The three most sacred offerings are considered most holy, which means that anyone who touches them—much less partakes of them—must have been previously consecrated, that is, made holy. For this reason, these three sacrifices may be eaten only by Aaron and his sons, that is, the male descendants of the priestly line. Any male of Aaron’s line who has been consecrated—even the blemished priests who are not permitted to officiate—may partake of the most sacred portions within the sanctuary precinct.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In contrast, the priestly portions of offerings labeled simply as “sacred,” rather than “most sacred,” such as the sacrifice of well-being and the first fruits offerings, are not restricted to those who have been consecrated. These offerings can be consumed by all members of the priestly family and household, including both the sons and the daughters of the line of Aaron, as long as they are not in a state of ritual impurity (see
  <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#num_18.1-32">
   Numbers 18:11–19
  </a>
  and
  <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
   Leviticus 22:1–16
  </a>
  ). It is interesting to note, however, that the daughter of a priest may eat of the portion of the sacred donations assigned to priests only while she is a member of a priestly household. According to
  <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_21.1-22.33">
   Leviticus 22:12–14
  </a>
  , if the daughter of a priest marries a layman, she may no longer eat of the sacred gifts. However, if she is widowed or divorced and without offspring, and she rejoins her father’s household, she can once again partake of the portion of sacred offerings allocated to the priests’ families.

  </b>
  (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
   6:2

  ). The Rabbis understood the burnt offering as a sacrifice brought for sins of the heart or mind,
  <i>
   hirhur halev
  </i>
  . According to
  <i>
   Vayikra Rabbah
  </i>
  7.3, this notion was derived from Job’s explanation of his burnt offerings on behalf of his children, when he said, “Perhaps my children have sinned and blasphemed God in their thoughts” (Job 1:5). In an ongoing midrashic discussion as to which sacrifice is divinely preferred,
  <i>
   Vayikra Rabbah
  </i>
  7.4 maintains that God favors the burnt offering because it is the only sacrifice that remains on the altar at night as well as during the day. A parable compares the situation to that of a king traveling in the desert. He stops first at one inn and eats and drinks, and then at another inn where he not only eats and
  <a id="page_609">
  </a>
  drinks but also stays overnight, showing that he favors the latter. Conversely,
  <i>
   Vayikra Rabbah
  </i>
  3 argues that God most esteems the meal offering because of its association with poverty.

  <i>

  9.4 asserts that God favors the thanksgiving offering because it is a freewill offering, rather than an obligatory one brought for the expiation of a sin. According to the Rabbis, the thanksgiving offering is the only sacrifice that will remain in the world-to come
  <i>
   (Vayikra Rabbah
  </i>
  9.7). Rashi comments on this verse (based on BT
  <i>

  54b) that the thanksgiving offering is an appropriate response to the following “miraculous” deliverances: a safe journey across an ocean or desert, release from imprisonment, and recovery from a serious illness.

    Such are the rituals of the burnt offering…and the sacrifice of well-being

  </i>
  (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#L7-37">
   7:37
  </a>
  ).
  <i>
   Vayikra Rabbah
  </i>
  9.9 suggests that the sacrifice of well-being, the
  <i>
   sh’lamim,
  </i>
  is last in this list of sacrifices because of the importance of
  <i>
   shalom,
  </i>
  peace, a theme which also appears at the end of many prayers. The Midrash lists a number of examples where the value of peace is deemed higher than the value of truth. Many of these situations involve women and endorse the value of peace in marriage. The most famous biblical example is that of Sarah and Abraham: When Sarah laughs at the possibility of conceiving a child, she says that it is impossible because of her husband’s age. However, when God repeats Sarah’s words to Abraham, God reports only that she complained of her own age (
  <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
   Genesis 18
  </a>
  ). This “lie” is understood by the Rabbis as a sign of the greater importance of marital harmony over truth. A story is also told about Rabbi Meir and a woman who came to hear him preach one Friday night and ended up staying so late that she angered her husband. When her husband swore that she must spit in Rabbi Meir’s face, Rabbi Meir miraculously understood this and pretended that he needed her to spit in his face for medical reasons, thereby restoring marital harmony (also

  (

  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">

  <i>
   Tanchuma

  connects this seven-day seclusion of the priests to the customary seven days of mourning after a family member’s death: Aaron was unknowingly in mourning for the future death of his two oldest sons on the eighth day—the day of the final consecration of the Tabernacle (see the next parashah). Aaron’s period of pre-mourning is compared to the pre-mourning that God is said to have done for seven days prior to the Flood

   Miriam’s Kitchen: A Memoir
  </i>
  (1997) is Ehrlich’s report on a year spent learning from her mother-in-law, Miriam, a Polish Holocaust survivor, the details of domestic religion—the laws and the lore. As the year passed, Ehrlich grew increasingly interested in becoming a ritual specialist in her home. She wanted to “infuse the minutiae of everyday life with something more.” She recognized that someone would have to make this a “priority mission,” and that that someone would be her.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  We can draw an arc from Elizabeth Ehrlich’s kitchen back to the Torah portion before us. Many contemporary Jews find this portion among those that make their eyes glaze over. Reform theologian Rachel Adler reports that when she was growing up she never heard the word “ritual” without it being prefaced by the word “meaningless.” Likewise, Arnold Eisen, a scholar of contemporary Judaism, for many years kept his sights on so-called higher things (like faith and covenant) in lieu of studying the sacrificial system
  <i>
   (Taking Hold of Torah,
  </i>
  1997, p. 71). If the rituals of sacrifice in the sanctuary (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
   6:1–7:48
  </a>
  ) seem to be of little interest, the elaborate rites for ordaining priests (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_8.1-36">
   8:1–36
  </a>
  ) appear to be both archaic and problematic in their exclusion of women from spiritual leadership.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Over the years Adler, Eisen, and many others have come to appreciate the power of the rituals described in this parashah. As we learn about ritual as a human phenomenon, we come to understand it as a language of its own, uniquely meaningful. To do justice to the sacrificial system, we need to contextualize Israelite sacrifice with the help of anthropology, sociology, comparative religion, and even neurobiology. We can ask also how this ritual of sacrifice was transformed in Christianity and in Judaism. When we consider the Jewish transformation of the sacrificial system, the question of gender, power, spirituality, and leadership can emerge in a more nuanced light.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Anthropologist Mary Douglas, who has been called “the mother of ritual studies,” shows that Leviticus has a specific way to approach the subject of spirituality and the body in relation to sacrifices (see the
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#page_571">
   introduction to 1:1–3:7
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Christianity transformed sacrifices by bringing sacrifices’ symbolism right into the heart of its worship service. Priests prepared and congregants ate and drank the Eucharist, the body and blood of the ultimate “lamb” of God. Carolyn Walker Bynum documents that although women were marginalized, in the Middle Ages nuns and upper-class lay women found their way into this system of sacralized food through rituals of fasting and in ecstatic feasting
  <i>
   (Holy Feast and Holy Fast,
  </i>
  1987).

  After the destruction of Jerusalem’s Temple, the Rabbis replaced the sacrificial system in two ways. The first was to commune with God through prayer and study. The second was via a system that maintained sacrifices in a new form, hinted at in
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#L7-22">
   7:22–27
  </a>
  : The whole complex of laws and rituals around preparing and eating food became another way in which the sacrificial system lived on. With this change, women became the ritual specialists for what was once temple sacrifice in its domestic transformation—because women in traditional Jewish society, as in many cultures, control food resources.

  The Talmud says that the table upon which we eat is like the altar of the Temple (BT
  <i>
   B’rachot
  </i>
  55a). We are bidden to wash our hands before breaking bread
  <a id="page_611">
  </a>
  not simply to cleanse them, but because the priests washed their hands before they offered a sacrifice. When making bread, the baker takes a small piece of the dough
  <i>

  </i>
  and burns it to represent the sacrifice. On the Sabbath, the
  <i>
   challot

  represent the showbreads sacrificed at the Temple.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  Guarding the traditional food taboos, taking
  <i>
   challah,
  </i>
  preparing the home for holidays and for the Sabbath (literally “making Sabbath”), and distributing food to the poor—all of these are areas in which women have controlled and executed significant ritual functions. There is an old saying quoted by Hayim Soloveitchik: “A
  <i>
   yidishe bale-boste
  </i>
  (Jewish home-maker) takes instruction from her mother only.”

 <div class="tab-enin">
  Susan Starr Sered, an anthropologist of religion, conducted a study of illiterate Kurdish Jewish women who were living in Jerusalem. That research led her to challenge preconceptions about the nature of spirituality and the holy. In her book
  <i>
   Women as Ritual Experts
  </i>
  (1992), she reports that these women developed religious culture alongside the Judaism of text and synagogue practiced by the men. As she notes, what anthropologist Robert Redfield calls the “little tradition” was based in the home, where women were the ritual experts. The domestic religion used many of the same symbols and ideas of the “male” Judaism but applied them to sanctify the daily tasks of the women, in the domain that they controlled. In Sered’s study, food preparation loomed large, from maintaining the laws of kashrut in the home to distributing cookies at the graves of ancestors after prayers had been answered. These women had developed what she called a “devotional autonomy.”

  During the Holocaust, some Jewish women who were interned in Terezin compiled a cookbook from memory. The Terezin prisoners recalled and wrote down their recipes for chocolate torte, breast of goose, plum strudel, and other traditional dishes while surviving on potato scraps. Their effort was a kind of spiritual revolt, an act of resistance against brutality, calling to mind the everyday world they had known and presided over. These half-forgotten recipes, scribbled on scraps of paper, became the texts that helped them to transcend their situation. Decades later, their book found its way to the daughter of one of the authors who had died in the camps. The book was published as

 <div class="tab-enin">
  Elizabeth Ehrlich—the kitchen apprentice to her mother-in-law—learned something surprising about spiritual leadership. This is not to say that women today should accept exclusion from the realms of study or politics and retreat back to home and hearth. Rather, as we seek lives of spiritual integrity, we would do well to widen our gaze beyond the so-called higher things, to recall the power of the home through which Jewish women—against great odds—have powerfully continued connection to God and community across generations.
