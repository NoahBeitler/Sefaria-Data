<div class="chap2" id="ch-25"><i>The Priestly Torah and the Priests’ Ordination
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> T<small>ZAV</small> (“issue a command”) continues with instructions about sacrificial offerings that began in Leviticus 1–5. However, whereas 1:1–2 began with instructions to all the people of Israel, 6:1 starts with a command specifically addressed to the priests. The first section of the parashah (Leviticus 6–7) contains instructions about the priests’ portions from the sacrificial rituals. The second section (Leviticus 8) records the ordination of the priests.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In establishing a sacrificial system and a professional priesthood, biblical Israel resembled other ancient cultures. One notes, however, two differences. First, priests in most cultures in the ancient world kept the secrets of their profession away from the public eye and transmitted them privately from generation to generation. In contrast, Leviticus reflects a commitment to keep the rules of the trade, as it were, in public view.
</div><div class="tab-enin">A second difference is that neighboring cultures such as Mesopotamia included women priests (even though they did not perform the same rituals as male priests), whereas the Bible recognizes only male priests. Scholars concur, however, that women played an important role in many facets of popular religion in ancient Israel (as did men), even though the priestly teachings in Leviticus do not acknowledge or discuss such roles.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Although <i>parashat Tzav</i> does not mention women explicitly, it treats three areas that do involve women. The first pertains to the roles and possible privileges of women as members of priests’ families. Such women apparently benefit from the priests’ share of sacrificial foods. There is a question, however, whether they may eat the part of the offering designated as “most holy” (see Another View).
</div><div class="tab-enin">The second area concerning women pertains to the highly valued, formal priestly garments (see Exodus 28 and Leviticus 8). Archeological and biblical evidence shows that women excelled in weaving, spinning, and sewing (see at Exodus 35:25; <i>T’tzaveh</i>, Another View; <i>P’kudei</i>, Another View). Therefore, we may assume that women made the priestly garments. According to the book of Samuel, each year Hannah made and brought a special garment for her son Samuel who served at the sanctuary at Shiloh (1 Samuel 2:19). Plausibly priests’ mothers and wives likewise made clothing for their family members.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">The third area to consider is whether women were among those who offered the sacrifices that these passages discuss. Biblical references elsewhere do suggest that Israelite women, like Israelite men, worshipped and sacrificed in the shrines—often as part of their households. For example, according to Leviticus 12:6 and 15:29, women are obligated to offer sacrifices after childbirth and irregular bleeding. Proverbs 7:14 presents a female persona who mentions her need to offer the well-being offerings. And in I Samuel 1, Hannah and her husband present and slaughter the offering that she has brought— together with a portion of flour and a jar of wine—to the shrine in Shiloh as payment for a vow.

</div><div class="head1" id="levi_6.1-6">INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE BURNT OFFERING (6:1–6)
</div><div class="tab-enin">Detailed instructions about this offering appeared in Leviticus 1, indicating that the entire animal is to be “turned into smoke” (see 1:9). The additional details here focus on the activity of the priests, instructing them concerning the permanent fire that must burn on the altar, and concerning the clothing the officiating priest must wear at different stages when disposing of the offering’s remains.
</div><b>Command Aaron and his sons.</b> Whereas Moses is charged with communicating most other laws to the people, here God directs Moses to convey these laws specifically to Aaron and his sons. (Because the laws apply to the priests themselves, it is reasonable to translate the plural noun <i>banim</i> here as “sons” rather than as “children.”)<br></br><i><b>ritual.</b></i> Heb. <i>torah,</i> which more widely means an “instruction” or “teaching” (see the introduction to Deuteronomy 6:20–25). Rendered as “Torah” (capitalized), this term comes to represent the entire first five books of the Bible (see at Deuteronomy 31:9). This is the first time that this term is employed in Leviticus.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:3"><b>The priest shall dress in linen raiment.</b> The fabrics that the “skilled women” wove for the Tabernacle (Exodus 35:25) were nearly identical to the material specified for the priestly garments (Exodus 28:5). Thus women probably also wove the fabrics for the priestly garments such as those mentioned here. Weaving is one of the household crafts or tasks typically carried out by women in traditional cultures (see <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View; <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:4"> The change of clothing allows the priest to leave the sacred precinct of the altar and dispose of the remains of the offering.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:5"><b>The fire on the altar shall be kept burning.</b> The fire both consumes the offerings and cleanses the altar from any leftover meat.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:6"><b>perpetual fire.</b> The priest keeps the sanctuary’s fire going. He takes care of the altar in the ways that homemakers—typically women—take care of the home. On the priests as “God’s housewives,” see <i>Vayikra,</i> Contemporary Reflection.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:7"><div class="head2" id="levi_6.7-16">INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MEAL OFFERING (6:7–16)<br></br>This section repeats some of the information from Leviticus 2 but adds a few details, namely who can eat the offering and what to do with it when a priest is being ordained. On this type of offering, see Leviticus 2.
</div><b>ritual.</b> Heb. <i>torah</i>; see at 6:2.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:10"><b>most holy.</b> This term, also translated “holy of holies,” typically designates the innermost sacred section of the Tabernacle (see Exodus 26:34). The sacred status of food consumed in the Tabernacle highlights the analogy between the Tabernacle and the body (see the introduction to Vayikra).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:11"><b>Only the males.</b> The translation here restricts eating of this sacrifice to Aaron and his sons. However, if one construes the Hebrew words as “every male” or “all males” (which is how this same translation understands the phrase in 24 out of 27 cases; see, for example, Numbers 1:20), the statement would permit all priests—not only the officiating priests—to partake in the offering. The purpose of the instruction may be to clarify that priests who are otherwise disqualified from officiating in the sacrificial ritual (because of characteristics described in 21:16–23; compare 22:1–7) nonetheless may eat of these portions. See also Another View, and at 10:12–14.<br></br><i><b>Anything that touches these shall become holy.</b></i> “These” refers to the <i>kodesh kodashim</i> (“most holy”), which in this context means the portion of the offering designated for the priests. This statement conflicts with Haggai 2:12–13, which claims that only impurity, not holiness, is contagious when touched. In either case, the notion of holiness in the Bible can be likened in modern terms to electric energy or radiation, either of which has the power to heal or to kill, depending on how it is handled. Jacob Milgrom uses the analogy of “high voltage” (<i>Leviticus: A Book of Ritual and Ethics,</i> 2004, p. 64). It is also possible that the statement means that a person must be in a state of purity before touching this offering.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="6:12–16" ref="6:12"> These verses essentially constitute a recipe for preparing the grain for the special meal offering on the occasion of a priest’s ordination. The priest offers it on his own behalf.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:16"> Ordinarily the priest eats the meal offerings; however, at ordination, the priest does not eat this special offering.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:20"><div class="head2" id="levi_6.17-23">INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PURGATION OFFERING (6:17–23)<br></br>These verses amplify the laws in Leviticus 4 by focusing on the different procedures regarding contact with the offering. They describe which portion of the sacrificial animal belongs to the priest and how priests must handle the dedicated food. While sometimes translated as “sin offering,” this sacrifice aims to cleanse the sanctuary from visible and invisible impurities that contaminate it. See further at Leviticus 4.
</div><b>Anything that touches its flesh shall become holy.</b> See at v. 11.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:21"><b>An earthen vessel…a copper vessel.</b> Vessels in which the meat is prepared must be purified. Since earthenware is porous, it cannot be completely “disinfected” and therefore has to be destroyed; metal vessels, however, can be washed. While these rules may correspond to safety measures intended to remove bacterial contamination, the official basis for these precautions in Leviticus is religious, not medical.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="6:22"><b>Only the males.</b> Or “every male.” See at v. 11.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:1"><div class="head2" id="levi_7.1-6">INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE REPARATION OFFERING (7:1–6)<br></br>The instructions about reparation offerings in Leviticus 5 focused in large measure on who needs to bring it, and on the alternate offerings that depend on the circumstances of the transgressor. The present section supplements those earlier instructions by focusing on the priest’s role and on his share of the offering. While sometimes translated as “guilt offering,” this type of sacrifice aims to restore the system to a normative wholeness (see at 5:14–26).
</div><b>ritual.</b> Heb. <i>torah</i>; see at 6:2.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:6"><b>most holy.</b> Heb. <i>kodesh kodashim,</i> which also means “holy of holies”; see at 6:10.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:11"><div class="head2" id="levi_7.7-10">CONCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PRECEDING OFFERINGS (7:7–10)<br></br>This section completes the earlier discussion of these sacrifices by designating explicitly what the priests are to receive in these cases. The officiating priest is to receive the benefit from both purgation and reparation offerings (7:7). The animal’s skin goes to the officiating priest in the case of the burnt offering (7:8). Presumably that skin would be made into leather used for clothing, footwear, and possibly writing material. One type of meal offering goes only to the officiating priest (7:9), whereas the other kind (7:10) goes to all priests. For more about these sacrifices, see Leviticus 1–5.
</div><div class="head2" id="levi_7.11-21">INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE WELL-BEING SACRIFICE (7:11–21)<br></br>Leviticus 3 described the sacrifice of well-being in great detail, focusing on the types of animal to be offered. This section supplements those instructions by discussing the occasions and different types of well-being sacrifices, as well as the manner in which they are to be distributed and eaten. Well-being offerings include thanksgiving offerings, votive offerings, and freewill offerings. The Bible elsewhere presumes that women are among those who bring these types of offerings (Numbers 30:4; I Samuel 1:3–4, 21, 24–28; Proverbs 7:14.)
</div><b>ritual.</b> Heb. <i>torah;</i> see at 6:2.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:12"><b>thanksgiving.</b> Heb. <i>todah</i> (“thanks”) designates the first type of well-being sacrifice. Whereas Leviticus 3 described the procedures regarding the sacrificial meat, this section describes the grain portion that accompanies the eating of the sacrifice.<br></br><i><b>unleavened wafers.</b></i> Heb. <i>challot matzot,</i> combining the terms for two types of “breads”: the <i>challah</i> and the <i>matzah.</i> (Subsequently, both terms come to be associated specifically with rituals for the Jewish home: <i>matzah</i> for Passover, and <i>challah</i> for Shabbat.) Women in the ancient world were the ones typically responsible for household baking. In Genesis 18:6–7 Abraham instructs Sarah to bake cakes for the unexpected guests while a male servant prepares meat. Jeremiah 7:18 condemns women for kneading dough to make cakes for the worship of the “Queen of Heaven,” whom they presumably viewed as the female consort of Israel’s (male) God. See at Exodus 16:3 and 25:30 and at Leviticus 26:26 for more details about women and baking.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:13"><b>cakes.</b> Heb. <i>challot,</i> the plural form of <i>challah;</i> in the Bible, this term does not refer to the braided bread associated with today’s use of this term.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:14"> A portion of this offering goes to the priest. Another goes to the party who is offering the sacrifice. This sacrifice thus enables the entire community to share a meal with each other and—symbolically—also with God.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:15"> There is no explanation as to why certain offerings (like thanksgiving or well-being offerings) must be eaten entirely on the first day, while others (like votive and freewill offerings, see next verse) can be kept for a couple of days. Health factors do not account for the difference.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:16"><b>votive or a freewill offering.</b> These types of well-being sacrifices are also shared between the priest and the offering party. Their meat may be eaten for two days.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:18"> Leftover sacrificial meat must be destroyed by fire when not consumed within the designated time period. Keeping meat for three days in the climactic conditions of Israel would have been a health hazard and may underlie the concern in this case. However, this reason alone cannot explain why the other well-being sacrifice—the one for thanksgiving—cannot be kept even for one day.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:19"><b>Flesh that touches anything impure.</b> Because the meat of this sacrifice is eaten in a public place, it is not necessarily subject to the carefully monitored conditions of the Tabernacle; therefore, the Torah specifies the care that a person must take when eating this offering.<br></br><i><b>only one who is pure.</b></i> The requirement of ritual purity (see Leviticus 15) means that a woman may not bring this sacrifice or eat from it during her term of menstrual impurity <i>(niddah),</i> nor for several weeks following childbirth (40 days after the birth of a son, and 80 days after the birth of a daughter; see at Leviticus 12). Likewise, a man who has an emission of semen or other discharges cannot offer the sacrifice or eat from it until he regains a state of ritual purity.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:20"><b>cut off from kin.</b> This punishment of being “cut off” (Heb. <i>kareit)</i> can be understood in a number of ways. The expression could mean that the individual should be ostracized, that is, deliberately excluded from the community. The term could also refer to divinely inflicted childlessness, a condition that in time will “cut” that person’s bloodline from the community (a consequence that does not entail communal punishment). Jacob Milgrom suggests in addition that <i>kareit</i> could mean that such a person will not be buried with the ancestors—and thus be denied the kind of reunification that marks a full life (<i>Leviticus</i>, 2004, p. 66). There are eighteen cases in the Torah that prescribe <i>kareit</i> (see Milgrom, p. 65). The verb form of the root <i>k-r-t</i> also appears as the term for making a covenant, such as when God makes a covenant with Abram <i>(karat…b’rit)</i> in Genesis 15:18.<br></br><i><b>kin.</b></i> Heb. <i>ammim,</i> which in this expression the text’s intended audience would have understood in a gender-inclusive sense, as the translation reflects. Despite the Bible’s penchant for patrilineal genealogies and patronyms, female relatives also counted as kin. See at Genesis 10:1. (See also “predecessors” in <i>The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, p. 408.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:30"><div class="head2" id="levi_7.22-27">PROHIBITIONS REGARDING THE FAT AND THE BLOOD (7:22–27)<br></br>Leviticus 3:17 prohibits eating the blood and certain types of fat of the sacrificed animal. The present section adds a punishment for violating this command. The rationale for not consuming blood (according to 17:10–12) is that the life of a living being is in the blood. No explanation is given for not eating the fat. However, references to “fat” elsewhere as especially valuable (for example, Genesis 45:18), suggest that burning fat completely might represent offering a precious gift to God. Here end the instructions to the priests.
</div><div class="head2" id="levi_7.28-36">FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE WELL-BEING SACRIFICE (7:28–36)<br></br>This section, addressed to all, describes a division of labor between those who bring the offering and the officiating priest. It specifies which portion of the sacrifice goes to the officiating priest (the breast and the right thigh) and which to the party making the offering (the rest of the offering).
</div><b>one’s own hands shall present.</b> Those making a sacrifice physically bring the offering to the altar. We learn from Numbers 30 that women make vows, and we learn from Leviticus 7:16 that vows often entailed making an offering. The present law implies that Israelite women, like Israelite men, would have access to the altar on these occasions if they were in a state of ritual purity. Note the story of Hannah: she vows to dedicate her son; then she brings him to the sanctuary where she also slaughters a sacrifice (I Samuel 1:11, 24–25).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:34"><b>the breast…and the thigh.</b> These large portions of the animal provide economic compensation to the priests, who did not usually own land and therefore could not produce their own food like other Israelites (Numbers 18:20; but see Joshua 21, where priests do seem to get some pasture land).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:37"><div class="head2" id="levi_7.37-38">AFFIRMATION OF THE SINAITIC ORIGIN OF THE SACRIFICIAL PRACTICES (7:37–38)<br></br>This concluding section brings to a close the extensive instructions about sacrifices that began in Leviticus 1:2. These verses specify that the anointed priests must come from the line of Aaron.
</div><b>rituals.</b> Heb. <i>torah;</i> see at 6:2.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:38"><b>on Mount Sinai…in the wilderness of Sinai.</b> The opening of Leviticus specified that God spoke to Moses from the Tent of Meeting (1:1) when commanding these sacrifices. The reference to Mount Sinai here stands in tension with that earlier mention of the Tent of Meeting. Contemporary critical scholars acknowledge the probability that various laws were assembled at different historical periods before reaching their final form. The attribution to Sinai aims to unify such traditions and communicate their antiquity and authority.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:2"><div class="head2a"><i>The Ordination of the Priests</i> (8:1–36)
</div><div class="tab-en">Detailed instructions for the ordination of the priests appeared in Exodus 28. The present passage describes the execution of these instructions. The account of the ordination, like that of building the Tabernacle itself, emphasizes that the instructions were carried out precisely (even if some of the details vary slightly). The ceremony entails the formal dressing of Aaron and his four sons. In English, the words “investment” and “investiture” refer (among other things) to the ritual of placing clothing—vestments—upon the priest. (Nowadays the term “invested” also applies to the official status conferred on a cantor, analogous to an “ordained” rabbi.)
</div><div class="tab-enin">Two issues in this section pertain indirectly to women. First, the priesthood in Leviticus is bestowed exclusively upon Aaron and his sons. Although it is common for priests in the ancient world to come from specifically designated families, it is unusual to have only a single family serve exclusively for generations. Moreover, whereas women in ancient Mesopotamia could be priests, the Torah authorizes only males from the line of Aaron to supervise and formally officiate at the communal sanctuary. The reason for this difference is not clear; see <i>T’tzaveh,</i> Another View. As for the women in priestly families—wives, daughters, and sisters—Leviticus 21–22 indicate that women are beneficiaries of certain privileges and also accountable to special standards (see especially at 22:12–13).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Second, the emphasis on the priests’ garments raises the question as to who made (and also who repaired) them. Did women in the priests’ household participate by spinning the yarn, weaving the fabric, and fashioning the garments? The Torah does not provide this information here, but see at 6:3. What does appear to be important to the writer of these accounts is that the ordination of the priests—rather than other communal events—constitutes a turning point that deserves close attention.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The ordination ceremony includes sacrifices delineated in Leviticus 1–7. One of the most unusual aspects of the ceremony is the smearing of certain parts of the priest’s body with oil and blood (8:22–24). Such a ritual also marks the purification of a <i>m’tzora</i>—a person afflicted with certain types of skin disease (see 14:9–20 and 23–29).
</div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv-1.3">GOD’S INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING THE ORDINATION OF THE PRIESTS (8:1–3)
</div><div class="tab-enin">The ordination of the priests begins when Moses places upon them their special accoutrements. Only priestly garments, not other clothes, receive an extensive description in the Bible. (Even the book of Esther, with its emphasis on the role of clothing, does not include detailed descriptions of clothes.) On the likelihood that women wove the fabric, see at 6:3.
</div><b>Take Aaron along with his sons, and the vestments.</b> A central feature of the ordination of the priests entails the formal dressing of the priests in “vestments,” an act that is reflected in English by the terms “vesting” and “investiture.” Exodus 28 describes these garments in detail, listing six items that are adorned with expensive material: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a fringed tunic, a headdress, and a sash.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:3"><b>community leadership.</b> Literally, “the whole community,” but the term can also refer to representative adult males, which better fits the present context. See at 4:13.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:6"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.4-30">MOSES’ ORDINATION OF THE PRIESTS (8:4–30)<br></br>Moses, who himself is not a priest but only a member of the tribe that claims descent from Levi, has the authority to sanctify and ordain the priests.
</div><b>brought…forward.</b> The Hebrew word is the same one used for offering a sacrifice (the root <i>k-r-b).</i> The priests in this ritual are, in a sense, an offering to God.<br></br><i><b>washed them.</b></i> Ritual washing accompanies virtually all acts of purification. See, for example, 14:9.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:7"><b>robe.</b> According to the book of Samuel, in the years after Hannah brings her young son to serve in God’s sanctuary, she makes for him “a little robe” (1 Samuel 2:19) to go with his linen ephod (2:18).<br></br><i><b>ephod.</b></i> This priestly outer garment was made of a variety of materials, including fabric most likely woven by women (see Exodus 28:5–12 for details and at Leviticus 6:3, above).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:8"><b>breastpiece.</b> This is a jeweled metal plate officiates; see at Exodus 28:15–30. (Nowadays the metal breastplate or breastpiece on Torah scrolls in many synagogues represents an attempt to reproduce or symbolize this item.)<br></br><i><b>Urim and Thummim.</b></i> The reference is to some physical object that priests used for consulting with God. It is unclear what the name means and what the object or objects looked like, although scholars have suggested that it was somewhat like a pair of dice that, when tossed, gave a “yes” or “no” answer to questions posed by the priest. See also at Exodus 28:30. The names suggest the meanings “light” <i>(urim)</i> and “right” or “whole” (<i>tumim</i>).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="8:10–12" ref="8:10"> As these verses indicate, the act of anointing sanctifies the Tabernacle and its furnishing, as well as the priests.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="8:22–24" ref="8:22"> The ordination ritual includes the peculiar act of smearing some of the animal’s blood and some oil upon the priest’s head, right ear, right thumb, and right toe—parts of the body that seem to represent the circumference of the whole. Leviticus does not explain the meaning of this act. Most likely it symbolizes the dedication and purification of the entire body or person. An identical ritual signals the purification of the <i>m’tzora,</i> the person stricken with a particular skin disease (on account of which he or she has been previously isolated from the community). This ritual is unique to these two occasions. It implies an analogy between the transition that the priest undergoes and that of the healed <i>m’tzora.</i> See Leviticus 14:9–20 and the comments there.</div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.31-36" ref="8:31">FINAL PREPARATORY STEPS: SEVEN DAYS OF THE PRIESTS’ ISOLATION (8:31–36)<br></br>The ordination ritual bestows holiness on the priests. Their isolation, which echoes that of menstruating women or persons isolated for skin disease in Leviticus 13–15, emphasizes the power and danger of the holy. Only after these seven days can the priests officiate in sacrificial service. With the completion of this ritual, all is ready for initiating the sacrificial system of the Tabernacle for the benefit of the community. The next parashah begins by describing that event as taking place on the eighth day.<br></br><i></i><br></br> </div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="right1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="chap" id="ano25-1"><div class="tab-en">M<small>OST LIKELY</small>, Leviticus 6:11 specifies that “only the males” among Aaron’s descendants may eat of certain sacrifices (rather than “every male”). Why can the females in Aaron’s line not partake of these offerings? What determines which priestly portions are restricted to the sons of Aaron, and which may be shared by his daughters as well?
</div><div class="tab-enin">The answer lies in the degree of holiness of the offering. The biblical text distinguishes between sacrifices considered to be “most sacred” (<i>kodesh kodashim)</i> and those considered to be “sacred” <i>(kodesh).</i> Three types of offerings fall under the rubric of “most sacred”: the meal offering (6:10), the purgation offering (6:18) and the reparation offering (7:6). The three most sacred offerings are considered most holy, which means that anyone who touches them—much less partakes of them—must have been previously consecrated, that is, made holy. For this reason, these three sacrifices may be eaten only by Aaron and his sons, that is, the male descendants of the priestly line. Any male of Aaron’s line who has been consecrated—even the blemished priests who are not permitted to officiate—may partake of the most sacred portions within the sanctuary precinct.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In contrast, the priestly portions of offerings labeled simply as “sacred,” rather than “most sacred,” such as the sacrifice of well-being and the first fruits offerings, are not restricted to those who have been consecrated. These offerings can be consumed by all members of the priestly family and household, including both the sons and the daughters of the line of Aaron, as long as they are not in a state of ritual impurity (see Numbers 18:11–19 and Leviticus 22:1–16). It is interesting to note, however, that the daughter of a priest may eat of the portion of the sacred donations assigned to priests only while she is a member of a priestly household. According to Leviticus 22:12–14, if the daughter of a priest marries a layman, she may no longer eat of the sacred gifts. However, if she is widowed or divorced and without offspring, and she rejoins her father’s household, she can once again partake of the portion of sacred offerings allocated to the priests’ families.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano25-2"><div class="tab-en1"><b><i>This is the ritual of the burnt offering</i></b> (6:2). The Rabbis understood the burnt offering as a sacrifice brought for sins of the heart or mind, <i>hirhur halev</i>. According to <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 7.3, this notion was derived from Job’s explanation of his burnt offerings on behalf of his children, when he said, “Perhaps my children have sinned and blasphemed God in their thoughts” (Job 1:5). In an ongoing midrashic discussion as to which sacrifice is divinely preferred, <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 7.4 maintains that God favors the burnt offering because it is the only sacrifice that remains on the altar at night as well as during the day. A parable compares the situation to that of a king traveling in the desert. He stops first at one inn and eats and drinks, and then at another inn where he not only eats and drinks but also stays overnight, showing that he favors the latter. Conversely, <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 3 argues that God most esteems the meal offering because of its association with poverty.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>He shall then take off his vestments</b></i> (6:4). The medieval commentator Rashi explains that this verse is a lesson in etiquette <i>(derech eretz),</i> teaching that a servant should change clothes between preparing food and serving it.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>One who offers it for thanksgiving</b></i> (7:12). <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 9.4 asserts that God favors the thanksgiving offering because it is a freewill offering, rather than an obligatory one brought for the expiation of a sin. According to the Rabbis, the thanksgiving offering is the only sacrifice that will remain in the world-to come <i>(Vayikra Rabbah</i> 9.7). Rashi comments on this verse (based on BT <i>B’rachot</i> 54b) that the thanksgiving offering is an appropriate response to the following “miraculous” deliverances: a safe journey across an ocean or desert, release from imprisonment, and recovery from a serious illness.

</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Such are the rituals of the burnt offering…and the sacrifice of well-being</b></i> (7:37). <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 9.9 suggests that the sacrifice of well-being, the <i>sh’lamim,</i> is last in this list of sacrifices because of the importance of <i>shalom,</i> peace, a theme which also appears at the end of many prayers. The Midrash lists a number of examples where the value of peace is deemed higher than the value of truth. Many of these situations involve women and endorse the value of peace in marriage. The most famous biblical example is that of Sarah and Abraham: When Sarah laughs at the possibility of conceiving a child, she says that it is impossible because of her husband’s age. However, when God repeats Sarah’s words to Abraham, God reports only that she complained of her own age (Genesis 18). This “lie” is understood by the Rabbis as a sign of the greater importance of marital harmony over truth. A story is also told about Rabbi Meir and a woman who came to hear him preach one Friday night and ended up staying so late that she angered her husband. When her husband swore that she must spit in Rabbi Meir’s face, Rabbi Meir miraculously understood this and pretended that he needed her to spit in his face for medical reasons, thereby restoring marital harmony (also <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 42; <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 48).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Take Aaron</b></i> (8:2). The Rabbis connect this “taking” of Aaron for his priestly duties with another biblical use of the word “taking” with respect to Aaron—his taking of the people’s gold and silver to make the Golden Calf in Exodus 32:4. As <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 10.4 puts it, “Let this ‘taking’ come and atone for that ‘taking.’”
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>anointing oil.</b> Vayikra Rabbah</i> 10.8 relates that the original 12 <i>logs</i> of oil (72 rabbinic “eggs’” worth) prepared by Moses miraculously sufficed not only to anoint the sanctuary and its vessels, and Aaron and his sons on each of the seven days of the sanctuary’s consecration, but also to anoint future generations of high priests and kings.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>You shall remain at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days, keeping</b></i> יהוה<i><b>’s charge</b></i> (8:35). Midrash <i>Tanchuma</i> connects this seven-day seclusion of the priests to the customary seven days of mourning after a family member’s death: Aaron was unknowingly in mourning for the future death of his two oldest sons on the eighth day—the day of the final consecration of the Tabernacle (see the next parashah). Aaron’s period of pre-mourning is compared to the pre-mourning that God is said to have done for seven days prior to the Flood <i>(Tanchuma,</i> ed. Buber II, 21–22).

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano25-3"><div class="tab-en">E<small>LIZABETH</small> E<small>HRLICH WAS ONCE</small> a comfortable “cultural Jew.” The practice of Jewish religion held little attraction for her. <i>Miriam’s Kitchen: A Memoir</i> (1997) is Ehrlich’s report on a year spent learning from her mother-in-law, Miriam, a Polish Holocaust survivor, the details of domestic religion—the laws and the lore. As the year passed, Ehrlich grew increasingly interested in becoming a ritual specialist in her home. She wanted to “infuse the minutiae of everyday life with something more.” She recognized that someone would have to make this a “priority mission,” and that that someone would be her.
</div><div class="tab-enin">We can draw an arc from Elizabeth Ehrlich’s kitchen back to the Torah portion before us. Many contemporary Jews find this portion among those that make their eyes glaze over. Reform theologian Rachel Adler reports that when she was growing up she never heard the word “ritual” without it being prefaced by the word “meaningless.” Likewise, Arnold Eisen, a scholar of contemporary Judaism, for many years kept his sights on so-called higher things (like faith and covenant) in lieu of studying the sacrificial system <i>(Taking Hold of Torah,</i> 1997, p. 71). If the rituals of sacrifice in the sanctuary (6:1–7:48) seem to be of little interest, the elaborate rites for ordaining priests (8:1–36) appear to be both archaic and problematic in their exclusion of women from spiritual leadership.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Over the years Adler, Eisen, and many others have come to appreciate the power of the rituals described in this parashah. As we learn about ritual as a human phenomenon, we come to understand it as a language of its own, uniquely meaningful. To do justice to the sacrificial system, we need to contextualize Israelite sacrifice with the help of anthropology, sociology, comparative religion, and even neurobiology. We can ask also how this ritual of sacrifice was transformed in Christianity and in Judaism. When we consider the Jewish transformation of the sacrificial system, the question of gender, power, spirituality, and leadership can emerge in a more nuanced light.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Anthropologist Mary Douglas, who has been called “the mother of ritual studies,” shows that Leviticus has a specific way to approach the subject of spirituality and the body in relation to sacrifices (see the introduction to 1:1–3:7).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Christianity transformed sacrifices by bringing sacrifices’ symbolism right into the heart of its worship service. Priests prepared and congregants ate and drank the Eucharist, the body and blood of the ultimate “lamb” of God. Carolyn Walker Bynum documents that although women were marginalized, in the Middle Ages nuns and upper-class lay women found their way into this system of sacralized food through rituals of fasting and in ecstatic feasting <i>(Holy Feast and Holy Fast,</i> 1987).

</div><div class="tab-enin">After the destruction of Jerusalem’s Temple, the Rabbis replaced the sacrificial system in two ways. The first was to commune with God through prayer and study. The second was via a system that maintained sacrifices in a new form, hinted at in 7:22–27: The whole complex of laws and rituals around preparing and eating food became another way in which the sacrificial system lived on. With this change, women became the ritual specialists for what was once temple sacrifice in its domestic transformation—because women in traditional Jewish society, as in many cultures, control food resources.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The Talmud says that the table upon which we eat is like the altar of the Temple (BT <i>B’rachot</i> 55a). We are bidden to wash our hands before breaking bread not simply to cleanse them, but because the priests washed their hands before they offered a sacrifice. When making bread, the baker takes a small piece of the dough <i>(challah)</i> and burns it to represent the sacrifice. On the Sabbath, the <i>challot</i> represent the showbreads sacrificed at the Temple.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Guarding the traditional food taboos, taking <i>challah,</i> preparing the home for holidays and for the Sabbath (literally “making Sabbath”), and distributing food to the poor—all of these are areas in which women have controlled and executed significant ritual functions. There is an old saying quoted by Hayim Soloveitchik: “A <i>yidishe bale-boste</i> (Jewish home-maker) takes instruction from her mother only.”
</div><div class="tab-enin">Susan Starr Sered, an anthropologist of religion, conducted a study of illiterate Kurdish Jewish women who were living in Jerusalem. That research led her to challenge preconceptions about the nature of spirituality and the holy. In her book <i>Women as Ritual Experts</i> (1992), she reports that these women developed religious culture alongside the Judaism of text and synagogue practiced by the men. As she notes, what anthropologist Robert Redfield calls the “little tradition” was based in the home, where women were the ritual experts. The domestic religion used many of the same symbols and ideas of the “male” Judaism but applied them to sanctify the daily tasks of the women, in the domain that they controlled. In Sered’s study, food preparation loomed large, from maintaining the laws of kashrut in the home to distributing cookies at the graves of ancestors after prayers had been answered. These women had developed what she called a “devotional autonomy.”
</div><div class="tab-enin">During the Holocaust, some Jewish women who were interned in Terezin compiled a cookbook from memory. The Terezin prisoners recalled and wrote down their recipes for chocolate torte, breast of goose, plum strudel, and other traditional dishes while surviving on potato scraps. Their effort was a kind of spiritual revolt, an act of resistance against brutality, calling to mind the everyday world they had known and presided over. These half-forgotten recipes, scribbled on scraps of paper, became the texts that helped them to transcend their situation. Decades later, their book found its way to the daughter of one of the authors who had died in the camps. The book was published as <i>In Memory’s Kitchen</i> in 1996 by Cara de Silva.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Elizabeth Ehrlich—the kitchen apprentice to her mother-in-law—learned something surprising about spiritual leadership. This is not to say that women today should accept exclusion from the realms of study or politics and retreat back to home and hearth. Rather, as we seek lives of spiritual integrity, we would do well to widen our gaze beyond the so-called higher things, to recall the power of the home through which Jewish women—against great odds—have powerfully continued connection to God and community across generations.
