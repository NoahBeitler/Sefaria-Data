  (“after the death [of]”) is the question of change. How is it that a person undergoes a transformation? What does it mean and how does it change her orientation to the Divine? The priestly writers also wonder how the people of Israel can undergo a collective change. The answer they provide is that change comes about through properly performed ritual. The priestly writers credited with much of
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml">
   Leviticus
  </a>
  advocate constant change. According to them, the body itself is an ongoing process of flux.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Fascinated with the body and the body politic, the priests speculate that both have the potential to reach purity and optimal holiness. The converse is also true—the body can become impure and the community tainted by transgression. Neither the state of impurity nor the state of purity is eternal. Both are time bound and set within a spectrum of gradations between purity and impurity. Priestly ritual mediates between these states, and it demarcates them so that individual and community alike can know where they stand in relation to God and to others.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The body is not at fault for entering the state of impurity, which can be reversed through time and water. As it develops, priestly thought comes to consider the states of purity and impurity as larger than the physical body and affected by moral transgressions as well. This parashah combines two strata of priestly thought that modern critical scholars label as “P” for the Priestly School (
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_16.1-34">
   Leviticus 16
  </a>
  ) and “H” for the Holiness School (
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
   Leviticus 17–18
  </a>
  ). The holiness of the sanctuary most concerns the P source, whereas the sacred nature of the land most concerns the H source. Both sources grant contaminating and purifying power to blood. Whereas
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_16.1-34">
   Leviticus 16
  </a>
  attends to transformation,
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
   Leviticus 17
  </a>
  stipulates how people should introduce holiness into their diet.

  Women must read and write themselves into the holy community presented in the H source. When
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  specifically mentions women, it is in terms of the dangerous and potentially contaminating force of their sexuality. They are figures in the household whose bodies require policing.
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  circumscribes the bodies of female relatives as forbidden, thus setting up a system of protection within the domestic domain. At the same time, these safeguards designate women as extensions of their husbands, brothers, and grandfathers and thereby restrict them. Such techniques are classic means of limiting women’s freedom.

  he parashah begins with a reminder about the penalty for the improper execution of ritual and for encroaching on the sanctuary. Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abihu, deviated from sacrificial protocol by offering “alien fire” (
  <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.1-7">
   10:1
  </a>
  ) that prompted their deaths.

  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_16.1-34">
   Leviticus 16

  now details a correct one. Together the two passages function as an envelope enclosing the laws of purity. The priests who execute the purity rituals are themselves subject to the fluctuating states of purity and impurity. The system is upheld on every level.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The key to understanding the often arcane priestly rituals is the notion of boundaries. The priests are invested in maintaining distinctions: Divine and human, Israel and Other, priests and people of Israel. As anthropologist Mary Douglas has shown, those distinctions function as homologies in the interlocking system of priestly boundaries: enforcing one boundary in this tight system simultaneously upholds the others. The conceptual boundaries become real in the social sphere when the people of Israel abide by the laws and perform the rituals.

  The demarcation of a specific area as the dwelling place of the Divine maintains the distinction between the holy and the profane. Other means of upholding this distinction include offering sacrifices at a precise time, and ensuring that all bodies involved in a ritual are in a state of purity—with no life-giving fluids seeping out.

  In order to avoid the death of more priests, a spatial boundary is established between the holy shrine and the Holy of Holies behind the curtain. Aaron, as well as his successors as chief priest, must not cross this line except on the Day of Atonement (
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L16-29">

  This simple raiment serves as a marker of the body’s purity while also demarcating the boundaries of the body. Similarly, clothing conveys that the body is in a state of ritual purity in the contemporary practices of wearing a white robe on Yom Kippur, and of the Muslim practice of

  Water in the priestly view is a powerful agent—it has the ability to dissolve impurity and usher a body into the state of purity. As he affects the transformation of all the people, the priest himself enters a different state bounded by a ritual bath before and after the rite.

  The premise here is that the chief priest can externalize misdeeds and transfer them to a sacrificial animal. As he sacrifices the animal, he removes the transgressions from an individual or from the community. (After the destruction of the Temple and the end of the sacrificial system, individuals became responsible for articulating their mistakes and separating from them through the language of repentance and prayer.)

  This is the name of the wilderness beyond the boundaries of settled life; most likely it originated as the name of a demon. Azazel in this case is best imagined as the antithesis of the Tabernacle/sanctuary, a place of disorder devoid of the relevant priestly distinctions.

  </i>
  In the priestly view, the body exists in a constant state of flux, moving in and out of various states. On one end of the spectrum rests the state of impurity. Although specific practices dissolve physical impurities, the residue of impurity accumulates at the central ritual site. Misdeeds also cause a kind of moral impurity that individuals must purge through acts of atonement. Since Israel’s actions impact its sacred space, the Tent of Meeting—like the body—must undergo a period of purification and subsequent transformation. In this sense, the body and sacred space are parallel domains.

  The priest brings the sanctuary into a state of purity and consecration. It is possible to see these two states as a result of all the actions performed by the priest (sacrifice, sprinkling of blood, and smearing blood on the horns of the altar). Jacob Milgrom sees the daubing of the altar horns as enacting purification, and the sprinkling as an act of consecration (
  <i>
   Leviticus
  </i>
  1–16, 1991, p. 1040). Another perspective is that the sprinkling of blood absorbs the taint of the people’s misdeeds from the Shrine and thereby purifies it.

  Removed from the corporate body of the community and from the space of the Shrine, the people’s transgressions must be transferred elsewhere. The scapegoat is the vehicle of this transference.

  In prophetic thought, water has the ability to transform not only physical states, but also a moral state of impurity. The prophet Isaiah says: “Your hands are filled with blood / Wash yourselves; cleanse yourselves” (Isaiah 1:15–16). A combination of priestly and prophetic perceptions of the transforming power of water rests in the background of the immersion ritual that effects conversion in Judaism as well as the Christian ritual of baptism (see

  The cleansing transforms the people in the eyes of God. It also maintains a good relationship between Israel and the Divine by restoring the people and the Shrine to a state of purity.

  After the priest removes past taint and transgression from Israel’s sacred sites, the priests and people alike enjoy safety and a new standing before the divine Presence in their midst. This tenth day serves as a day of collective transformation when all enter a renewed state of purity. All assume some responsibility for tainting the shrine and the community, and they release themselves from the consequences through the chief priest’s confessions and the symbolic rites of sacrifice.

  In terms of the history of religion, a timeline becomes evident. In an early period of Israelite religion, people slaughtered animals in the fields or at local religious sites as part of regional festivals where the offering and eating of meat had ritual significance. As the priests began to assert centralized power, they outlawed such offerings and mandated sacrifice officiated by a priest at a specific site. (Compare to

  Eating, sex, and worship are interrelated aspects of life in the biblical imagination. In the ancient world, meals and feasts alike were dedicated to deities. Thus the book of Numbers recounts an episode when the Israelite men go astray in the wilderness by eating contraband food, having sex with Moabite women, and thus drawing close to the god Baal-peor (
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.1">
   25:1–3

  ). Likewise, according to the present verse, eating meat whose blood does not come into contact with the altar of Israel’s God counts as an illicit tryst with goat-demons.

  he book of Leviticus maps an elaborate terrain of states and objects both pure and impure, placing clear borders between them. As leading scholars of Leviticus emphasize, the states of “ritually pure” or “ritually impure” are not moral categories, but rather indices of how close a particular body can draw to the spaces demarcated as repositories of the holy. As the holy is bounded and separated from the profane, so must the body adhere to boundaries when approaching the holy. Leviticus defines geography and physicality by corresponding conceptions of boundaries. As collective recognition of limits uphold sacred space, so individuals maintain the sanctity of the body by policing what goes into and comes out of it.

  The distinction that concerns the writers in
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  is that of Israel versus other nations: the people of Israel are not to behave like Egyptians or Canaanites. Although the unit distinctly deals with prohibited sexual couplings, the issue here is one of geography and identity more than physicality. In this respect, the laws establish geographic and cultural borders between the people of Israel and the Egyptian empire, as well between Israel and the Canaanites among whom they live. Israel is different, according to Leviticus, in not allowing the perverse couplings permitted among the other peoples. This does not prove that the sexual practices forbidden to the Israelites were ones actually practiced by the Egyptians or Canaanites; rather, these laws help to produce the categories of Israel and Other. Geography is at stake because Israel’s most powerful memory is the exodus from Egypt. As for Canaan, in addition to divine promise, Israel’s land claim derives from the Canaanites’ having made the land odious by their practice, which requires the redemptive purification of Israelite settlement. By outlining the forbidden limits of Israelite sexuality, the priestly writers symbolically establish an ideal set of “geographic” borders that definitively separate Israel from other nations.

  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_16.1-34">

  FORBIDDEN RELATIONS (18:6–23)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The sexual laws, addressed to men as normative, begin with the prohibition of incest and sexual relations among close kin relations. Anthropologists maintain that prohibitions to establish distinctions in the familial realm are the very basis of culture. The prohibitions against incest—an act that effaces the difference between family members—are consistent with the priestly agenda of maintaining categories. This section outlines who an Israelite man cannot have sexual relations with because they are too close, while at the same time it points out bodies that are forbidden because they are too far from being Israelite. The nuclear family, even step and half-members, is too close, while members of nations such as Egypt and Canaan are too far. Setting such internal and external borders carves out a sexual identity for Israel in the space between.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  With the exception of the law forbidding coupling with animals (
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L18-23">
   18:23
  </a>
  ), this litany of sexual laws does not address women. Rather than subjects, women are objects to be or not be “uncovered.” One wonders how the laws might be different had they been addressed to women and men as equal sexual partners and also what unwritten codes determined the sexual practices of Israelite women.

  The “uncovering” of nakedness refers to different types of sexual interactions. According to a story early in Genesis, Noah “exposed himself” in a drunken stupor after the Flood; his son Ham saw his “father’s nakedness” and related the observation to his brothers (

  ), mother and father are grouped together in the law forbidding incest. A mother’s status is emphasized through repetition. The law prohibits the maternal body because it belongs to the father and because it is the site of birth. [It is noteworthy, however, that the mother’s nakedness is not explicitly tied to the father, unlike the case of the father’s wife (v. 8). —

  As noted earlier, in this section’s litany of sexual laws, women are objects to be or not be “uncovered.” Here, the prohibition against intimacy with a stepmother follows that of parental incest because a stepmother is seen as an extension of the father.

  A polygamous family in antiquity likely hosted siblings close in age born to different mothers.

  The topic shifts in this verse from incest to other kinds of forbidden sexual acts. In Leviticus, the body in its pure state is discrete and bounded, with no internal fluids seeping out. In the creation story of
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1
  </a>
  , God orders the primordial chaos into distinct categories with boundaries between the elements. The blending of categories on the cosmic or the human level is a movement out of order and into chaos—or, in other words, from life to death. The impure body has sores or oozes fluids that transgress physical boundaries (
  <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_14.1-32">
   Leviticus 14–15
  </a>
  ). That which the body should contain flows out and mixes with the external world. Priestly authorities disqualify such a body from participation in ritual. This, as well as an interest that sex result in procreation, lies behind the interdiction against approaching a menstruating woman in order to “uncover her nakedness.” Sex with a menstruating woman becomes an increasingly grave transgression in the sequence of Leviticus: In
  <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#L15-19">
   15:24
  </a>
  the man who thus has sex with a menstruating woman enters a parallel state of impurity that lasts for seven days; in our verse, such a mingling is expressly forbidden; and in
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#L20-18">
   20:18
  </a>
  , the offense is grounds enough for the expulsion of both partners.

  . In the early 21st century, this is one of the most misinterpreted, abused, and decontextualized verses in the Torah. This verse, ripped from its place in the system of levitical laws, is often mobilized to justify discriminatory legislation and behavior against homosexuals and their families. While the act of anal intercourse would present a problem to the person who organized his life according to the levitical laws, it has no place in judicial systems not governed by the total system of Leviticus—and does not cohere with contemporary sexual notions of mutual consent and sexual preference.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In Leviticus, the priestly writers want to prevent the mixture of different types of fluid, as well as uphold distinctions. In terms of blending fluids, anal intercourse is problematic for the same reason as is intercourse with a menstruating woman: semen, an agent of life, potentially mixes with feces, a substance that symbolizes decay and death. This is similar to the mixture of semen and menstrual blood that indicates the absence of conception. In addition, the priestly writers want to avoid the blending of gender categories, as evident in their choice of language. They do not command “do not lie with a male,” but rather “do not lie with a male as one lies with a woman.” The problem arises when someone treats a male body like a female one. Indeed, such distinctions between the male and the female body define women as those who are penetrated during sexual intercourse and dominated during social intercourse. While treating a man in this manner is odious behavior, it is construed as the natural way to engage women. (See also at
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.13">
   20:13

    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  That is, homosexual sex transgresses the boundary between male and female by penetrating the male body as one does the female body. The priestly writers speak of it as an act of mixture that confused categories in the same way that combining certain foods, seeds, or fabrics confuse categories (see
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.19">
   19:19

  </i>
  Where the previous verse speaks of lying with a woman, this verse speaks of a woman directly. Unlike the male subject addressed as “you,” the female subject appears in the third person. Curiously, the only law directed to women is that forbidding bestiality. Perhaps this expresses a chain of sexual command in the priestly imagination, in which a man always has power over a woman and a woman is only more powerful than animals. (In the more severe context of
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.1-8">
   Leviticus 20
  </a>
  , woman and man alike who have carnal relations with a beast are slated for death.) However, this law also places a woman in charge of her own sexuality. Rather than holding men responsible for women who engage in bestiality, this law depicts women as commanding their own sexual actions in this instance.

  REASONS AND CONSEQUENCES: DON’T DO AS THE CANAANITES DID (18:24–30)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The writers justify Israelite penetration into the land because the other inhabitants have defiled it. The issue of which bodies can be penetrated (the topic of
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   vv. 6–23
  </a>
  ) now finds its corollary in why the Israelites must penetrate and conquer the land. The land appears as a kind of geographic female body that rejects the practitioners of impure acts by spewing them out.

  Adherence to the laws is the safeguard against rejection by the land. While Israel elsewhere figures as the bride in its relationship to God (see, for example, Hosea 2), it figures here as the groom in its relationship to the land. If Israel contaminates the land with non-sanctioned mixtures and couplings, then she will throw him out as she has earlier partners.

  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18:6
  </a>
  , the introductory statement banning men from sexually approaching
  <i>
   sh’er b’saro,
  </i>
  one’s own flesh, naturally implies daughters. This explanation is unsatisfactory because the other relations are enumerated; the author does not explicitly identify the daughter, as he does the sister.
 </div>
 <div class="list1">
  2.
  <span class="space">
  </span>
  Some argue that it was not necessary to write about the daughter, either because the taboo against father-daughter sexual contact was so ingrained in society that it did not need to be listed, or because fathers supposedly would never approach their daughters sexually. Some interpreters have suggested that a father would not have sex with his daughter because he would lose the ability to garner a generous bride-price for a non-virgin.
 </div>
 <div class="list1b">
  3.
  <span class="space">

  Finally, some argue that the Torah does not legislate what one does with one’s personal property, and a daughter was considered the property of her father (until transferred to another man).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  However, each of these attempts at explanation is problematic. The omission of the daughter is even more troublesome when we note that Israel’s neighbors did explicitly ban father-daughter sexual relations in their law collections; in fact, the Laws of Hammurabi (¶ 154) goes so far as to banish a man who lies with his daughter.

  To this date, nobody has made a convincing argument to demonstrate that the daughter is implicitly included in the list. Our task today is to take her absence seriously. We know all too well the startling number of fathers who sexually abuse their daughters in our society. Even if we do not know the real situation for daughters in the biblical period, we must be sensitive to the current message that the daughter’s omission may have for today’s survivors and perpetrators.

   17:14
  </a>
  ). Discussing this verse, the 13th-century commentator Nachmanides notes that the relationship between life (
  <i>
   nefesh)
  </i>
  and blood
  <i>
   (dam)
  </i>
  is referred to three times in this unit. According to
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L17-11">
   17:11
  </a>
  , the life is “in” the blood
  <i>
   (ki nefesh habasar
   <span class="underline">
    b
   </span>
   ’dam hi)
  </i>
  while the beginning of
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L17-14">
   17:14
  </a>
  teaches that the blood is “in” the life
  <i>
   (ki nefesh kol basar damo
   <span class="underline">
    b
   </span>
   ’nafsho hu).
  </i>
  Using the analogy of wine mixed with water, Nachmanides suggests that one can equally say that the water is “in” the wine or the wine is “in” the water. Thus, the end of
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
   v. 14
  </a>
  states that the life “is” the blood
  <i>
   (ki nefesh kol-basar damo hu).
  </i>
  Ultimately, he claims, the two are inseparable; one cannot be found without the other.

  </i>
  (
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L18-6">
   18:6
  </a>
  ). Translated hyperliterally, this verse reads, “A man, a man
  <i>
   (ish ish),
  </i>
  to any of his near flesh, you (plural) shall not come near
  <i>
   (lo tikr’vu).”
  </i>
  Although one might think that these incest prohibitions are directed only at men, the
  <i>
   Sifra (Acharei Mot
  </i>
  13.1) explains that the verse applies to everyone: the repetition of “man”
  <i>
   (ish)
  </i>
  is said to include non-Jews, while the second-person plural
  <i>
   (tikr’vu)
  </i>
  includes women.

   18:17
  </a>
  ). Mishnah
  <i>
   Sanhedrin
  </i>
  9:1 makes clear that although the Torah in this passage does not explicitly mention incestuous relations with a daughter or step-daughter, it prohibits such relations as well, and deems them punishable by death. The Talmud points to this verse as the source for these prohibitions (JT
  <i>
   Sanhedrin
  </i>
  9:1, BT
  <i>
   Sanhedrin
  </i>
  76a). The Rabbis understood this verse to prohibit a man from sexual relations with a woman when he is
  <i>
   married
  </i>
  to her daughter or to her mother (based on the parallel verse in
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.9-21">
   Leviticus 20:14
  </a>
  , which forbids a man from
  <i>
   marrying
  </i>
  a mother and daughter). Thus, a man’s sexual connection with his own daughter by his wife or with his wife’s daughter by another man also means that he has violated this prohibition. As for incest between a man and his daughter by a woman to whom he was not married, the Rabbis derived the prohibition by logical inference: since this verse (and similarly in
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.9-21">
   v. 10
  </a>
  ) forbids relations with a granddaughter, then all the more so it must forbid relations with a daughter.

  (

   18:18
  </a>
  ). In his commentary on this verse, Nachmanides observes that sisters should not be rivals since they are meant to love each other. In their interpretations, Rashi and Sforno both note that following his wife’s death, a husband may marry her surviving sister. According to BT
  <i>
   P’sachim
  </i>
  119b, at the end of days God will reward the righteous with a great banquet. The patriarch Jacob will decline the honor of leading the blessings after the meal, because his marriages to Leah and Rachel violated this prohibition.

    EVITICUS

  </small>
  one of two passages in the Torah (the other being
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.1-8">
   Leviticus 20
  </a>
  ) that consists of sexual regulations meant to distinguish Israel from the surrounding nations and make it a holy people. Although the prohibitions in our passage have had a profound impact on Western sexual morality, its assumptions are remote from—and in some cases even abhorrent to—contemporary sensibilities.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  First of all, Leviticus evaluates sexual behaviors not in terms of the emotional and relational dimensions of sexual experience that are so central to judgments about sexual morality today, but in terms of the categories of purity and pollution. The purpose of anti-pollution laws is to impose structure on the chaos of experience by ensuring that social and symbolic boundaries are respected and that things conform to their proper class.
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  forbids a series of discrete behaviors that supposedly cause defilement and thus disrupt the social/religious world, but it offers no
  <i>
   positive
  </i>
  understanding of holy sexuality.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Second, if we look at the social order that the Levitical anti-pollution laws protect, it seems to consist of extended patriarchal families in which the honor and authority of male heads of household is the primary social value.
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
   Verses 7
  </a>
  and
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_8.1-36">
   8
  </a>
  do not forbid the father to sexually violate his child but rather
  <i>
   forbid the son to violate the sexuality of his father
  </i>
  by committing incestuous adultery with the father’s wife. The verses instruct the less powerful party not to dishonor the powerful by treating the wife’s sexuality simply as her husband’s possession. Some of the incest prohibitions, such as the outlawing of marriage with two sisters (
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_8.1-36">
   v. 18
  </a>
  ), work to the benefit of women, but it is not women’s concerns and interests that animate the text. The striking absence of the most prevalent incest violation, namely that between father and daughter, makes clear that it is not the purpose of Leviticus in this case to protect the weak and defenseless.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Third, the marginalization of women within the social world presupposed by
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  is underscored by the prohibition of sex with a menstruant in
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   v. 19
  </a>
  . On one level, this prohibition fits quite seamlessly into the purity-related concerns of Leviticus. The book earlier defines many bodily emissions as defiling, placing menstrual blood in a similar category with semen and other discharges from the penis, as well as nonmenstrual discharges from the vagina (
  <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">
   Leviticus 15
  </a>
  ). On another level, however, the proscription of sex with a menstruating woman is part of a larger symbolic complex in which menstrual blood has particularly negative associations. The prophets liken adultery, idolatry, and murder to menstrual impurity (see Ezekiel 36:17, for example), while the book of Lamentations describes conquered Jerusalem as a menstruating woman whose “impurity clings to her skirts” (1:9).

  Fourth, the passage in
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  most often cited today, namely the prohibition of male anal intercourse in
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   v. 22
  </a>
  , serves as a major justification for homophobia in current religious and political debates and also helps to maintain gender hierarchy. A man who penetrates another man “as one lies with a woman” is guilty of mixing or confusing kinds. He treats another man as one should treat only a woman, thereby moving a male body into the category of female. In the world of Leviticus, doing so both unmans the particular man who is the penetrated partner and threatens the notion of penetrative intercourse as a defining aspect of gender difference.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <a id="page_697">
  </a>
  It seems then that, despite its attempts to promote holiness,
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  , far from fostering holiness in sexual relations, reflects and reinforces many of the structures of domination that support sexual and family violence. The passage contains important insights that contemporary Jews can affirm: we need some boundaries in sexual relationships; sexual behavior is not simply a private matter; individual behavior is connected with the ethical character of our social world.
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  seeks to implement these ideas in its own time and place. But we need to find ways to express these insights in the context of an ethic of sexual holiness appropriate for the 21st century.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  We can see
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  not as a static document that we must either accept or reject but as a part of Jewish tradition that grapples problematically with ongoing human problems. If so, we can also use it as a starting point for raising hard questions about our own sexual values. What should be included on a list of forbidden and permitted relationships today? Are there certain “bottom lines” that we would want to be part of any statement of sexual norms? How do we balance the need to safeguard those with less power in sexual relationships with the desire to lay out a constructive vision of holy sexuality? How might we articulate a person-centered ethic that focuses on qualities of human connection rather than on the intrinsic nature of particular sexual behaviors? How do we ensure that our sexual values reflect fundamental ethical values such as honesty and justice that ought to guide all human interactions? What place do we give to feelings as a dimension of holy sex? How should pleasure figure into our ethic, for example? How do we attend to the social structures that undergird and make possible holy and sustainable relationships? What social rights and obligations might we see as fundamentally connected to the ability to create satisfying relationships?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  A contemporary response to
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  , in other words, requires both criticism and transformation. It requires careful examination and rejection of those presuppositions of Leviticus that produce and support sexual injustice. But it also involves imagining an alternative ethic that brings in the concerns and questions of those whose perspectives are erased or marginalized by Leviticus itself—as well as by our culture today. Such a response seeks to create the foundation for a sexuality and sensuality that is life-giving for all.
