  (“when you enter”) is concerned mostly with the Israelites’ entrance into the Promised Land. There they must offer first fruits and tithes, according to the ceremonies outlined in
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_26.1-15">
   26:1–15;
  </a>
  and there most of the laws in
  <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu_12.1-16.17">
   Deuteronomy 12
  </a>
  –
  <a href="#deu_26.1-15">

  </a>
  will take effect. These laws, outlined in the prior Torah portions and concluded here (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_26.16-19">
   26:16–19;
  </a>
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_28.69">
   28:69
  </a>
  ), aim to regulate society when Israel settles in Canaan. Using language familiar from other parts of Deuteronomy, this parashah emphasizes that Israel should obey God’s commandments faithfully, with all their heart and soul. Since the covenant between God and Israel establishes mutually binding obligations for both parties, God’s commitments also are reaffirmed: the promise to make Israel a treasured, holy people. This parashah is directed to a dual audience: first, to Moses’ imagined audience in Moab, the Israelites who listen to his words as he prepares them to enter the land of Canaan; and second, to the audience addressed by the authors of this part of Deuteronomy, who composed their work during the exile (586–538
  <small>
   B.C.E.
  </small>
  ) or even later, after the return from exile.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The parashah also details the ceremonies that the Israelites are to perform once they enter the land, as a way to reaffirm the covenant (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_27.1-26">
   27:1–26
  </a>
  ). As in the ancient Near Eastern treaties upon which Deuteronomy is modeled, the reiteration of the covenant concludes with a list of blessings for those who uphold it—and curses for those who do not (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_28.1-68">
   28:1–68
  </a>
  ). The last part of the parashah (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_29.1-8">
   29:1–8
  </a>
  ) begins Moses’ final address to the people. He recounts the wondrous deeds that God performed on behalf of the people, the experiences that form the foundation of the covenantal relationship and that provide the inspiration for Israel to walk in God’s ways.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The laws in the first part of this parashah mention women only as widows, who are counted among the underprivileged (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu26-12">
   26:12;
  </a>
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu27-19">
   27:19
  </a>
  ), and as objects of impermissible sexual relations (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#d27-20">
   27:20
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_22.13-29">
   22–23
  </a>
  ). However, matters of gender take on more importance in the blessings and curses at the end of the covenant stipulations. Human fertility becomes a national issue that is linked to the fertility of livestock and the land, all of which are promised blessings if Israel obeys God’s commands (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#d28-4">
   28:4
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu11">
   11
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu18">
   18
  </a>
  ). In the subsequent section, one curse concerns a man who makes the arrangements to marry a woman, build a house, and plant a vineyard—all symbols of establishing a new family unit and household—but who will lose
  <a id="page_1192">
  </a>
  these things to another man before he has enjoyed their benefits (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#d28-30">
   28:30–32
  </a>
  ). The horrors of siege, conquest, and exile—signaling the ultimate breakdown and destruction of Israel’s society—affect women and men alike. Both sons and daughters will be taken into exile (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#d28-32">
   28:32
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#chap-fn41-4">
   41
  </a>
  ); and in the famine of the siege, both women and men will become cannibals who horde their “food” from their loved ones (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#d28-54">
   28:54–57
  </a>
  ). Such graphic curses depict what will transpire if Israel fails to obey God’s commandments. Hence, in its strongest rhetoric, Deuteronomy urges its audience to follow the laws that form the heart of this book.

  oth first fruits and tithes assume an agricultural society, which is to begin with the settlement in Canaan. (For information on women in agrarian society, see
  <a href="fm-07.xhtml#page_xli">
   “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.”

 </div>
 <div class="head2" id="deu_vv.1-11">
  FIRST FRUITS (26:1–11)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Generally, the Israelites are to dedicate first fruits to God in thanks for the fertility that yielded the produce—and with the hope that this fertility will continue (see at
  <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu15-19">
   15:19–23
  </a>
  ;
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-19">
   Exodus 34:19
  </a>
  ;
  <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#L27-26">
   Leviticus 27:26–27
  </a>
  ). In this case, however, people are instructed to show gratitude for the possession of the land (mentioned three times in
  <a href="#deu_26.1-15">
   vv. 1–3
  </a>
  ) through a ceremony that celebrates the fulfillment of God’s promise of land to the ancestors. After all, the offering of the first fruits is a direct outcome of, and a performative act in recognition of, God’s giving the Promised Land to Israel. In keeping with Deuteronomy’s principle of centralization of sacrificial worship, the first fruits are to be brought to God’s Chosen Place (meaning the Temple in Jerusalem) on Shavuot, the late spring pilgrimage festival that celebrates the grain harvest (see at 16:9–12). The occasion includes a festive meal, to be shared with the Levites and resident aliens who would not have their own first fruits. Although there is no mention here of other family members participating in the ritual, 16:11 explicitly includes women in the Shavuot celebration.

 <div class="tab-enin">

  </i>
  Although the language in
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_26.1-15">
   26:1–15
  </a>
  is grammatically masculine singular, Moses addresses both the male head of the household and his wife or principal wife (see

  </i>
  <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#page_1134">

    <a href="#chap-fn3-1" id="chap-fn03-1">
     “our fathers.”
    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  In this translation, the term
  <i>
   avot
  </i>
  is understood to refer specifically to the patriarchs when they serve as representatives of their households (
  <a href="#chap-fn15-1">
   here and v. 15
  </a>
  ); elsewhere, it is rendered in a more inclusive sense as “ancestors” (as in
  <a href="#deu26-7">
   v. 7
  </a>
  ). Although the forefathers alone are invoked in this verse, the covenantal promises are inclusive (see at
  <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
   Genesis 17
  </a>
  ).
 </div>

   </b>
  </i>
  The liturgy to be recited during this ceremony reviews Israel’s history from the end of the descent to Egypt in the time of Jacob, through the Exodus, to the coming to the land; it omits the wilderness period and the revelation at Sinai. Instead, the text emphasizes the deeds that God performed for Israel. This passage, along with its midrashic explanation, has become a central part of the Passover Haggadah.

     “My father was a fugitive Aramean.”
    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  Or, “wandering Aramean.” “My father” probably refers to Jacob, father of the twelve tribes. The patriarchs and matriarchs came from Aram Naharaim, which is where Jacob flees to and starts a family with Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah (
  <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#G30-2">
   Genesis 30

  ).

 <div class="head2" id="deu_vv.12-15">
  TITHES (26:12–15)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The tithe of the third year is not to be taken to the central sanctuary like the tithes of the first and second years (
  <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu14-22">
   14:22–29
  </a>
  ); instead, it is distributed locally to those who are dependent on public assistance, including widows and Levites (see at
  <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#chap-fn19-2">
   12:19
  </a>
  ).

     deposited any of it with the dead.
    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  In ancient Israel, people believed that they could assist the spirits of the dead by providing food and drink for them to consume in Sheol, the place where all the dead resided. This verse does not prohibit this practice, though it does exclude the use of tithed foodstuff for this purpose. Contact with the dead is considered a source of ritual impurity (Jeffrey Tigay,
  <i>
   Deuteronomy,
  </i>
  1996, p. 244).

   </b>
  </i>
  Elsewhere in the Bible, God’s abode is conceived of as an earthly sacred space (as in
  <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
   Exodus 25:8
  </a>
  ); but in Deuteronomy, God is considered transcendent and not located in any place on earth. The book speaks of God’s “name” dwelling in the Chosen Place (as in
  <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu12-5">
   12:5
  </a>
  ) to counter the impression that God literally dwells there. This verse shows how Deuteronomy uses a traditional idiom but modifies it to fit its distinctive theology.

  As in

  , this phrase means that God chooses Israel to be holy and set aside for God. This idea stems from the view that Israel’s God assigned other gods to different nations (see at
  <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#chap-fn19-2">
   4:19–20
  </a>
  ) while establishing a special relationship with the people of Israel. This does not mean that Israel views itself as innately superior to other peoples, although the God of Israel is considered more powerful than all other gods (see also at

  ERECTION OF INSCRIBED STONES AND A STONE ALTAR AT MOUNT EBAL (27:1–8)

  This section instructs the Israelites to set up plaster-coated stones at Mount Ebal on which “this Teaching” will be written after they cross the Jordan. At the same location, they are to erect an altar of unhewn stone for offering sacrifices. Mount Ebal is located near the town of Shechem (modem day Nablus), about thirty miles from the site of the crossing of the Jordan and hence too far to reach on the same day. (Compare Joshua 4:19, which offers a different version of these events.)

  , the blessings and curses in this unit constitute promises or punishments that will befall Israel depending on whether the people obey or disobey God’s commandments. Although the blessings and curses are formulated in second-person masculine singular language, they are addressed to the entire community and apply to the community as a whole, not to individuals. Similar examples of blessings and curses are found in
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e23-20">

  The Bible models the covenant between God and Israel on the model of a treaty between two human parties, one of whom is superior to the other: the superior promises protection, and the inferior promises loyalty. Ancient Near Eastern international treaties generally contain, near the end, warnings about the consequences of a breach of the treaty; such dire threats aim to motivate the inferior party to uphold the treaty and not rebel against the overlord.
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_28.1-68">
   Deuteronomy 28

   B.C.E.

  , the time when much of Deuteronomy is thought to have originated. The tradition of curses is also attested in legal texts going back at least as far as the Laws of Hammurabi (1792–1750
  <small>
   B.C.E.
  </small>
  ). The curses may reflect the actual experience of the Babylonian exile, assuming that this unit was one of those parts of Deuteronomy added or edited after the exile (586

  THE CURSES (28:15–68)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The section on the curses is longer and more graphic than the depiction of the blessings, although they parallel each other in part. The curses warn that God will call upon nature and foreign enemies to bring ruin to Israel, which means that Israel will lose the land that God promised. Deuteronomy makes the continued settlement in the Promised Land contingent on obeying God (whereas the promise of the land to Abraham in Genesis was unconditional). The theology of Deuteronomy, which may be largely postexilic (after 586
  <small>
   B.C.E.
  </small>
  ), paves the way to explain the destruction of the Temple and the exile as resulting from Israel’s sins and disobedience. This passage closely corresponds to the curses in
  <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_26.3-46">
   Leviticus 26

  <a href="#deu28-24">

  </a>
  ). The description also correlates with conditions of a city under siege, as Jerusalem experienced before its destruction in 586

  After having suffered the losses and degradation mentioned so far, the people’s ultimate end will be their annihilation. This moving description pictures the enemy’s invasion and destruction of the agriculture of the land (partially, at least, to feed the invading army). Then come siege and starvation, which eventually lead to cannibalism. The unusually detailed descriptions of the selfish, secretive actions of the man and woman vividly convey the desperate and inhumane nature of the situation.

  Most difficult to read is the description of the mother eating her dead babies and even the afterbirth. Lamentations 2:20 and 4:10 also depict women as cannibals (see at
  <a href="#deu28-55">
   v. 55

Likewise, in the account of a famine in Samaria (II Kings 6:24–30), what may look to some readers like the callous eating of children by the women illustrates the severity of the famine, not any fault in the women. Maternal cannibalism is considered the “end of the rope”; it convinces the king that all is lost. (See also

  After a warning about diseases that God will bring on Israel, this passage looks beyond the siege to the captivity and survival in a foreign land. Although a scattered remnant will remain, they will live in anguish and dread. Even worse, Israel’s history will be reversed: the plagues that the Egyptians suffered will be visited upon Israel (

  ccording to Deuteronomy, Moses addresses the generation of Israelites who have experienced the exodus and wandering as they near the end of their journey. He reminds them of all that God did for them during the time of the exodus and wandering, which they are now in a better position to appreciate.

  Moses announces that although the Israelites experienced these events, they were not able to understand their significance until they now prepare to enter the land, the culmination of and reason for all they have been through. Note, however, that the presumed audience may not have been physically present at those earlier historic moments, except perhaps as children.

  [Whereas most of the past events that Moses has recalled thus far in Deuteronomy occurred some 40 years earlier, here Moses uses the pristine condition of the sojourners’ clothing to demonstrate God’s care in terms visible to the current generation. The rhetorical purpose here and throughout this parashah has been to impress upon the contemporary and future audiences just how generous and faithful God has been, and how and why the Israelites owe allegiance to their God. —

  [Or “the words (

It casts the people’s obligation in terms of loyalty to the words of this covenant, that is, the comprehensive program for a just society that cares for all its members and is loyal to its one God. —

  the blessings that reward those who keep the commandments with the curses that punish those who spurn them. Perhaps the most horrifying threat is that enemy invaders will devour the crops and cattle (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#d28-54">
   28:51
  </a>
  ), causing even “tender” mothers to eat their own children (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#chap-fn4-56">
   28:56–57
  </a>
  ). Here, as elsewhere, Deuteronomy presents a framework that we can fill out from other sources; the obvious intertext in this case is the book of Lamentations. Lamentations 4:5 depicts the upper class—“those who feasted on delicacies…those reared in crimson”—reduced to starvation and squalor. This helps us understand that in our parashah, the mother who “would never venture to set a foot on the ground” (
  <a href="#chap-fn4-56">
   28:56
  </a>
  ) is a member of the privileged elite, wearing the ancient equivalent of “taxi shoes” (those not for walking). One wonders if the adjective “tender” (
  <a href="#chap-fn4-56">
   v. 56
  </a>
  ) is ironic; not only does this mother eat her children, but according to Lamentations 4:10, she boils them first. These biblical passages remind us that enemies can reduce us to desperate measures and diminish us morally, causing us to perform formerly unimaginable acts in order to survive. Yet not all women eat their babies, even when in truly dire straits. How many actual mothers in Nazi concentration camps risked their own lives to preserve their children?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Who are the enemies that the curses of this parashah refer to? Deuteronomy blames the Israelites themselves: the enemy invasion and economic collapse are depicted as the self-induced consequences of failing to keep the commandments (
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#d28-15">
   28:15
  </a>
  ). People on the brink of death from starvation can face choices beyond their worst nightmares, but a reasoned choice was possible earlier on: the just society represented by Deuteronomy’s laws versus the unjust society reflected by its curses.

  For Deuteronomy, the measure of a just society is at the margins—the treatment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow (
  <a href="#deu26-12">
   26:12
  </a>
  ). If a community does not respond to their needs, then it risks creating the very conditions in which, according to Deuteronomy, even the most privileged are bound to suffer. In such circumstances, how will we treat our babies and those in need?

  7.1 suggests that this apparent repetition refers to the double reward that obedience to God’s commandments in this world, such as synagogue worship and study, will merit in the world-to-come: “Whoever listens to the voice of the Torah in this world will be privileged to listen to the voice of which it is written, The voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride’ (Jeremiah 16:9).” According to this midrash, “Moses said to Israel: ‘Whoever listens to the words of the Torah is exalted in both worlds, so be diligent to listen to the words of the Torah.’”

  <i>
   Sh’mot Rabbah
  </i>
  7.5, “in the city” refers to rewards for precepts performed in the city—including
  <i>
   challah
  </i>
  (dough offering; see

   Numbers 15:18–21

  <i>
   tzitzit
  </i>
  (tassels), sukkah, and the kindling of the Sabbath lights. While only men must fulfill
  <i>
   tzitzit
  </i>
  and sukkah, rabbinic Judaism considered
  <i>
   challah
  </i>
  and the kindling of Sabbath lights (
  <i>
   hadlakat nerot)
  </i>
  to be specifically female ritual responsibilities. Together with observance of the laws connected with the
  <i>
   niddah
  </i>
  (menstruating woman), these three women’s obligations were known in rabbinic parlance by the acronym
  <i>
   ChaNaH,
  </i>
  which spells the name “Hannah,” alluding to Samuel’s mother—whose supplication to God in I Samuel 2:1–10 is seen as the model of sincere prayer. According to Judith Hauptman, Mishnah
  <i>
   P’sachim
  </i>
  and its Tosefta both assume women’s knowledge of key home rituals like separating challah or baking matzah. Rather than supervising the women, or assuming the duties themselves, men relied upon women’s expertise in order to retain a state of sinlessness and ritual purity (
  <i>

This image of the loving mother who turns deadly is a staple of folk literature; it appears in the Bible as a symbol of the world turned upside down by war and famine (II Kings 6:25–29; Lamentations 2:20). It also fits with the broader prophetic portrait of the nation as a formerly beautiful and prosperous woman now degraded and suffering (Amos 4:1–3; 5:1–3; Lamentations 1:1).

Seizing her child, an infant at the breast, ‘Poor babe,’ she cried, ‘amidst war, famine, and sedition, to what end should I preserve you?…Come, be food for me, to the rebels an avenging fury, and to the world a tale such as alone is wanting to the calamities of the Jews.’ With these words she slew her son, and then, having roasted the body and devoured half of it, she covered up and stored the remainder. At once the rebels were upon her and, scenting the unholy odor, threatened her with instant death unless she produced what she had prepared. Replying that she had reserved a goodly portion for them also, she disclosed the remnants of her child” (
  <i>
   The Jewish War

  2.23 in a story about an infant named Doeg ben Joseph: “Every day his mother would measure him by handbreadths and would give his [added] weight in gold to the Temple. And when the enemy prevailed, she slaughtered him and ate him; and concerning her Jeremiah lamented, ‘Shall the women eat their fruit, their new-born babes?’ (Lamentations 2:20). Whereupon the Holy Spirit replied: ‘Shall the priest and prophet be slain in the Sanctuary of
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
   יהוה

  ?’ (Lamentations 2:20).” For the Rabbis, the horror of the mother’s actions parallels the divine outrage at the murder of Zechariah ben Jehoiada in the Temple, referred to in II Chronicles 24:20–22. Rabbinic attitudes toward women and their bodies are symbolic: the tender mother who cares for her child stands for the world as it ought to be, while the baby-devouring mother shows the world gone mad.

  , we make numerous transitions and undergo various rites of passage, of both a formal and informal nature, consciously or unconsciously. Frequently these transitions are marked by ceremony and ritual of some kind: a
  <i>
   b’rit bat
  </i>
  or
  <i>
   b’rit milah,
  </i>
  a bat mitzvah or bar mitzvah, a
  <i>
   mikveh

  immersion, a wedding. These are solemn moments, both for ourselves and for our closest relatives. Often they are accompanied by self-scrutiny, a vow, and a determination to improve, to “turn over a new leaf.” The same is true of the beginning of each new year; indeed, this is the central theme of our prayers on both Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur. It also holds good when we move into a new home, freshly decorated, the walls clean and as yet unmarked by greasy fingers, the windows crystal-clear and gleaming, the empty rooms waiting to be filled with our lives.

  When Benjamin Ze’ev (Theodor) Herzl gave expression to his extraordinary prophetic vision of a Jewish state in both
  <i>
   Der Judenstaat
  </i>
  (The Jews’ State) and
  <i>
   Altneuland
  </i>
  (Old-New Land), he described a new community, one in which the land would be developed through science and technology, in which there would be tolerance in all spheres, and which would be organized socially on a cooperative (“mutualist”) basis. The pioneers of the Second Aliyah, motivated by similar lofty ideals, developed precisely this kind of cooperative way of life when they founded the
  <i>
   kvutzot
  </i>
  and kibbutzim that became a hallmark of the new socialist communities—and eventually of the autonomous State of Israel. The Declaration of Independence drawn up by the founders of the state in 1948 also proclaimed equality of all citizens, irrespective of race, religion, or gender. Fundamental concepts of social justice, many of which are rooted in the precepts of Deuteronomy, ground much of the legislation passed by Israel’s Knesset (Parliament) from its inception. Indeed, Israel was one of the first countries to pass a law stipulating equality between women and men. For most of the first fifty years of its existence, Israel was a welfare state. Underlying this new venture was not only divine promise but also the memory of past suffering, both recent and long gone by. When Herzl had presented his amazing plan to the Rothschild family, requesting their financial help in turning dream into reality, he wrote: “We are talking about a simple old matter—the exodus from Egypt.”

  Almost the entire book of Deuteronomy is a reprise, not only of the events of the forty years in the wilderness (which the people Moses is addressing have not witnessed themselves), but also of the commandments first encapsulated in the giving of the Decalogue at Sinai and later elaborated in the long, detailed catalogues of precepts and prohibitions. Now, in
  <i>

  and the passages that follow, the time has come to look toward the entry into the new home, to review the covenant, and to rededicate oneself—individually and as a people—by first acknowledging the fact that God has fulfilled the promise given to our forebears. This is to be immediately followed by an expression of awareness of past suffering—not necessarily one’s own, but that of the collective. Remembrance of things past is an essential part of developing a new identity, beginning a new existence. The formulation of this memory in the First Fruits ceremony, with its reference

  to the “fugitive” or “wandering Aramean” (
  <a href="#chap-fn5-1">
   26:5
  </a>
  ), surely stirs within the modern reader recollections of the trials and tribulations of Jews in the Diaspora, which culminated in the unprecedented horrors of the Holocaust. The purpose of these recollections is to stimulate us to behave differently from those who oppressed us—to give to “the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat their fill” (

  </a>
  ).

  Being the favored of God entails duties and responsibilities. Failure to observe is to be cursed; obedience brings blessings, prosperity, fruitfulness. Above all, doing God’s bidding means that Israel will be established as “God’s holy people” (
  <a href="#page_1201">
   28:9
  </a>
  ) and will be “the head, not the tail” (
  <a href="#deu28-13">
   28:13
  </a>
  ). In contrast, the detailed, terrifyingly graphic list of horrors that will be heaped upon the people if they fail to abide by God’s laws ends with perhaps the direst of warnings: to be scattered among all the peoples “from one end of the earth to another” (
  <a href="#deu28-64">
   28:64
  </a>
  ) and, worst of all, to become slaves once again (
  <a href="#deu28-68">
   28:68
  </a>
  ).

  The message of

  applies to us even now, whether we live in Israel or in the Diaspora. To justify Israel’s existence as a Jewish state and homeland, it must forever strive to be a “light unto the nations” and not a state like any other. As a people, wherever we are, we have a remarkable and noble mission—to fulfill God’s precepts, whether they deal with our relationship to the Divine or—more concretely—with our relationships with our fellow human beings, all of whom have been created in the divine image.
