  (“when you bring up”) chronicles, in three major units, the start of the Israelites’ journey from Mount Sinai toward the Promised Land. The first unit (
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_8.1-9.14">
   8:1
  </a>
  –
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#n9-14">
   9:14
  </a>
  ) concerns the Tabernacle: its rituals, special laws regarding the Levites who serve in it, and the laws concerning the passover offering. It includes the purification and consecration of the Levites. It also addresses the situation of those who, because of being ritually impure, are unable to observe the passover offering at the right time; it institutes a substitute “second Passover” (
  <i>
   pesach sheni
  </i>
  ), observed a month after the original due time of the passover offering (
  <a href="#num9-9">
   9:9–13
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The second unit (
  <a href="#num_9.15-10.36">
   9:15
  </a>
  –
  <a href="#chap-fn36-2">
   10:36
  </a>
  ) concentrates on the instructions for the traveling of the Israelites: the signals for moving ahead in the right direction and for making camp (the cloud and the trumpets). It concludes with the description of the first stage of the journey after leaving Sinai.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The third unit (
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_11.1-12.16">
   Numbers 11–12
  </a>
  ) dramatically illustrates the discontent of certain Israelites who begin to challenge Moses (and, less directly, God) by their complaints on this first leg of the journey, and the divine punishments that follow as a consequence. An outstanding example is when, nostalgic for the plentitude left behind in Egypt, the people complain harshly about the lack of meat. Moses reacts with deep despair—to the point of asking to die rather than bear the burden of leadership. In response to his petition concerning the burden of bearing the people all by himself, God instructs him to gather representative elders of Israel and bestow some of his spirit upon them. This approach both shares the burden and demonstrates Moses’ spiritual superiority. Paradoxically, however, Moses’ authority is challenged by two of those elders (
  <a href="#num11-26">
   11:26–29
  </a>
  ) and then by his own siblings, Miriam and Aaron (
  <a href="#num12-1">
   12:1–2
  </a>
  ). In each of these episodes, Moses appears as a patient, caring, and extremely modest leader. While the narrator emphasizes his greatness and nobility, the people are presented as rebellious and ungrateful.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  With regard to women, the parashah includes the enigmatic and disturbing story about Miriam. Moses’ sibling complains against Moses’ and his (new?) marriage to a “dark-skinned” (or “Cushite”) woman (
  <a href="#num12-1">
   12:1
  </a>
  ). In her challenge, Miriam—together with her brother Aaron— attempts to claim equal footing with Moses as a prophet (
  <a href="#num12-2">
   12:2
  </a>
  ). God punishes Miriam—not Aaron—with a skin disease because of her complaints, and she recovers only due to Moses’
  <a id="page_844">
  </a>
  intercessory prayer. Feminist interpreters often understand this story as an intended rebuke of a woman who aspires to a leadership role equal to a man’s, reading it as prejudicial to women on a number of levels. As we will see below, it is also possible to read this account more sympathetically, as a case in which God sides with one maligned woman (Moses’ wife) against a more powerful one (Miriam).

  he parashah opens with the final commands for the Israelites before they begin their journey away from Sinai. It includes rituals regarding the kindling of the menorah’s lamps, the purification of the Levites, and the passover sacrifice.
 </div>
 <div class="head2" id="num_8.1-4">
  LIGHTING THE LAMPS OF THE LAMPSTAND (8:1–4)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Aaron is charged with lighting the menorah (see
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_27.20-21">
   Exodus 27:21
  </a>
  ) and now does so. This completes the story of the Tabernacle’s erection and dedication and also concludes the story of the dedication offerings brought by Israelite chieftains at the conclusion of the previous parashah (
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_7.1-89a">
   Numbers 7
  </a>
  ), pointing out the unique “offering” that was presented by Aaron, the chieftain of Levi’s tribe. For descriptions of the lampstand and its function, see
  <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#e25-31">
   Exodus 25:31–40

 <div class="head2" id="num_8.5-26">
  PURIFYING, CONSECRATING, AND APPOINTING THE LEVITES (8:5–26)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Even before this parashah, a number of passages have singled out the tribe of Levi (to which Moses and Aaron belong). In Exodus, the men of Levi zealously side with Moses following the incident of the Golden Calf, wreaking vengeance on the guilty parties (
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e32-26">
   Exodus 32:26
  </a>
  ).
  <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#N1-46">
   Numbers 1:46–49
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#N2-33">
   2:33
  </a>
  , and
  <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#n3-19">
   3:15
  </a>
  make clear that the men of Levi are counted separately from the other tribes in the census since they have to be dedicated to God’s service by being appointed over the holy work in the Tabernacle (
  <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#N1-50">
   1:50–54

  Now the Levites are singled out further, this time formally dedicated to God’s service, such as by assisting the priests, the sons of Aaron. (For the purifying, consecrating, and appointing of Aaron and his sons as priests, see
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">

  Literally, “the entire community”; this translation construes the word for community,

  as referring here to a representative body made up of adult males. However the terms are parsed, the entire community is to formally bestow its agreement to accept the Levites as representing it before God; but practically speaking, only a part of the Israelites will lay their hands (v. 10) on the Levites.

  The Levites are “set apart” as attendants to Aaron and his sons (the priests), and are
  <i>
   themselves
  </i>
  dedicated as an elevation offering before God. The Levites are further set apart as dedicated to God’s service, in lieu of the male first-born of each Israelite woman outside of the Levite tribe (
  <a href="#num8-16">
   8:16–17
  </a>
  ;
  <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#num3-12">
   see also at 3:12–13
  </a>
  ). As the parashah continues, it reiterates that each of the three levitical familial groupings—Gershonites, Kohathites, and Merarites (named for the grandfather and great-uncles of Moses, Miriam, and Aaron) has its own task in the Tabernacle service and its own Tabernacle components to carry (

  CELEBRATING THE PASSOVER OFFERING AND ADDING A “SECOND PASSOVER” (9:1–14)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  This section records an existential problem addressed to Moses, namely, the fact that it is impossible for some Israelites to be ritually pure in time for the passover sacrifice. The section concludes with a legal mandate from God, instituting a second opportunity for the people to observe the passover offering a month later. This legal mandate widens to include also Israelite householders (and perhaps others) who happen to be distant from the Tabernacle and are unable to perform the passover offering at the right time. We find four other cases in the Torah when a query prompts a new law: the case of the blasphemer (
  <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_24.10-23">
   Leviticus 24:10–16
  </a>
  ); the case of the man gathering sticks on the Sabbath (
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#N15-32">
   Numbers 15:32–36
  </a>
  ); and twice, the case of the daughters of Zelophehad, namely Mahlah, Milcah, Noah, Hoglah, and Tirzah (see at
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   27:1–11

  The original passover offering was arranged by household (
  <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-2">
   Exodus 12:3
  </a>
  ), which is the basic unit of Israelite society. This translation presumes that it is a household’s head who would normally “present” the passover sacrifice (v. 7) on behalf of the household, before sharing it with all of its members. (Presumably householders were males, a fact that would go without saying.) It is also possible that the group in question was composed of other impure individuals, women and men, not specifically householders.

  God mandates that those unable to observe the Passover ritual at the designated time, on the fourteenth day of the first month, offer their sacrifice a month later, on the fourteenth of the following month.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  [This option of an alternative passover offering a month later (what the Rabbis called “Second Passover” or
  <i>
   pesach sheni
  </i>
  ) illustrates a capacity to modify time-bound obligations on account of certain circumstances. One wonders whether this precedence and flexibility could also apply when women were ritually impure because of childbirth or menstruation. However, there is no mention of such modifications regarding women. —

  INVITING HOBAB TO ACCOMPANY ISRAEL (10:29–32)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Amid all the details of the journey, the Torah weaves in a human interest story. Here, Moses addresses Hobab the Midianite, who until now has been staying with the Israelites in the Sinai wilderness—asking him to accompany them on their continuing journey to the Land of Israel.

  Hobab is either another name for Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro (father of Zipporah), or perhaps Moses’ brother-in-law. [Either way, it remains unclear what happens to Zipporah, Moses’ wife. In

  his unit describes three major challenges to Moses and God. In all three cases, fixed elements appear in a similar order: the sin of the people (or a group among the people); God’s punishment; a petition to Moses requesting that the punishment be removed; Moses’ prayer; the punishment’s termination; and the naming of the site after the episode that occurred there.

  This first tale of woe—the incident at Taberah—is exceedingly concise (three verses), yet it comprises an entire story.

  CRAVING MEAT (11:4–35)

  This story is more complex and developed than the tale of the complainers (
  <a href="#num_11.1-12.16">
   11:1–3
  </a>
  ), and its plot has more twists. In contrast to the previous episode, here the people’s sin is specified: they crave meat. Moses, in anguish, places his two problems before God. How is he to carry all these people whom he did not produce? Where will he get meat to feed them? These two questions shape the structure and development of the story. God responds by commissioning seventy representative elders to help Moses and by providing meat.

  This statement—literally

  The details about manna’s virtues refute each of the arguments that the people raise, especially their claim that the manna is dry. Their complaints, together with this report of the manna’s merits, reflect the people’s gluttony and ingratitude. Their nostalgia for Egypt, which was known as their house of bondage (as in
  <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e13-3">

  Moses turns to God before the punishment that befalls the people. Rather than praying that God’s punishment be lifted from the people (as in the story of the complainers,
  <a href="#num_11.1-12.16">

  </i>
  Moses’ questions are rhetorical and the simple meaning of the verse is: “I did not produce all these people, so why do you put all this burden on me?” As he attempts to illustrate the absurdity of his situation, Moses uses motherhood as the ultimate symbol of devotion. He cites a mother’s enormous love and compassion, concern for all of her children’s needs, and boundless dedication. One way to read Moses’ questions is that he is comparing himself to that ideal mother. [The rhetorical questions also suggest that it was not Moses who was Israel’s mother, but rather God. The verbs that Moses uses specifically refer to pregnancy (
  <i>
   hariti
  </i>
  , here rendered as “produce”) and birthing (
  <i>
   yalad’ti,
  </i>
  here translated as “engender”). By implication Moses asserts that God is the one who—as it were—conceived Israel, was pregnant, gave birth to Israel, and now should carry Israel. Although Israel’s God transcends gender, the Bible contains gendered images of the Divine: male imagery is more common (see at
  <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.1-21">
   Exodus 15:3
  </a>
  and
  <a href="56_chapter_53.xhtml#chap-fn6-2">
   Deuteronomy 32:6
  </a>
  ), but we do find female imagery for God (see the introduction to
  <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.22-17.16">
   Exodus 15:22
  </a>
  –
  <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e17-16">

  <a href="56_chapter_53.xhtml#deu32-18">

  </a>
  ). Here in Numbers we have a striking depiction of God that refers to women’s activities such as giving birth. Moses uses such strong maternal language to characterize God’s unique relationship with the people. —

  In response to Moses’ petition in v. 13—“Where am I to get meat?”—God supplies meat from an unexpected source: a flock of quail blown in by sea wind, which arrives at the Israelite camp. The plentiful quantity suffices for the entire people. However, the people’s craving and hunger are so great that they fall upon the birds without restraint or embarrassment, filling their mouths and bellies. Their frenzied consumption of the quails causes a plague that spreads among those who consume them.

  The people bury the many victims at a site whose name translates as “Graves of Craving.” This name indicates that the people’s sin is in craving for meat when God has already provided sufficient manna to sustain them. The Torah blames the people for not making do with manna as their food.

  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#g1-26">

  seems to advocate vegetarianism;

  and
  <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu14">
   Deuteronomy 14

  If cravings for meat so angered God, then why does God supply the people with what they ask, and in such great quantities?

The Bible refers to Cushites with awareness of their dark skin (Jeremiah 13:23). In Jeremiah 38:7–13, a Cushite saves Jeremiah’s life.

  What connection does the previously mentioned woman bear to this complaint about Moses in relation to his siblings’ prophetic roles? The statement highlights one of several crucial gaps in this story. As prophets themselves, the siblings may think that they are entitled to the same privileged status accorded Moses. Indeed, if status is Miriam and Aaron’s primary concern, then perhaps they oppose Moses’ marriage because his wife is of the “wrong” status. Alternatively, this complaint may parallel what will be expressed by Korah and his assembly when they accuse Moses and Aaron of exalting themselves “above” God’s congregation (

  </i>
  Why is Miriam alone punished for the siblings’ complaint? Is it because she is a woman who demands a leading position? Many commentaries hold that she—and not Aaron—is punished because she is the primary speaker against Moses. Whereas both of them complain about Moses’ prophetic status (
  <a href="#num12-2">
   v. 2
  </a>
  uses the plural verb
  <i>
   vayomru),
  </i>
  it is possible that only Miriam criticizes Moses’ marriage (
  <a href="#num12-1">
   v. 1
  </a>
  uses the feminine singular
  <i>
   va-t’daber);
  </i>
  and thus only Miriam receives God’s punishment for that criticism. Some contemporary commentators, who consider the text here to be sexist, also argue that Miriam alone is punished because she is a woman who dares challenge authority. However, if we understand the word
  <i>
   cushit
  </i>
  (“Cushite” in our translation) to mean “dark-skinned,” then Miriam may be punished for insulting a dark-skinned woman. She alone turns white (in an ironic twist) because she alone spoke out on that particular subject.

    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  God’s response includes a symbolic punishment after Moses’ intercession. The full ramifications of God’s explanation remain obscure. Three points, however, are clear. First, God’s words imply that the reason for the seven days’ seclusion is shame—like the shame that befalls a daughter who was insulted by her father. This is not like the usual seclusion of the
  <i>
   m’tzora
  </i>
  (the person stricken with scale disease; see at
  <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_13.1-59">
   Leviticus 13
  </a>
  ). Second, the statement (that a daughter is shamed for seven days when her father spits on her) discloses something of an assumed and accepted practice in the community. Third, the father-daughter analogy seems to soften the harshness of the incident by referring to God as father and Miriam as God’s daughter: she is still a member of God’s household, as it were (
  <a href="#num12-7">

  what to make of the story of Miriam: she is afflicted with snow-white scales for daring to challenge Moses—and by implication, God (
  <a href="#num12-1">
   12:1–16
  </a>
  ). First of all, this reader is outraged. Why is Miriam punished, but not her brother Aaron? And why is she punished at all, given the legitimacy of their complaint against Moses? Like so many passages in the Torah,
  <i>
   B’haalot’cha
  </i>
  seems to express values that are difficult to accept. Upon reflection, though, this reader’s outrage is softened—for there is much here that speaks to the power of women, even as it reflects unease about their authoritative voice.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Moses has married a foreign woman and his siblings complain, perhaps upset that Moses continues to lead Israel despite violating the law while they, leaders who are guilty of no such wrong, remain subject to his authority. Imagine their surprise when God responds directly to their complaint—and their dismay when God chastises them and supports Moses. Aaron seems not to suffer for his insubordination, but Miriam’s punishment is described in detail. She is afflicted with a horrible skin ailment that threatens to place her in a state of ritual impurity and block her access to God’s holiness. As if this were not enough, she must remain outside the Israelite encampment for a full week, like a disobedient daughter shamed by her father.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  At first, the story of snow-white Miriam seems a perfect example of a double standard, for God permits the brother independent thought but punishes the sister for the very same ideas and words. Still, the story is more than that, for it shows us how much all of Israel valued Miriam. Her brothers plead for her, as Aaron beseeches Moses and then Moses prays to God to reverse their sister’s punishment. And the people do not respond by abandoning this victim of God’s great anger. Rather, they “did not march on until Miriam was readmitted” seven days later (
  <a href="#numv-15">
   v. 15
  </a>
  ), thus expressing their solidarity with the woman who in happier times led them in victory song and celebration (
  <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
   Exodus 15:20–21

    Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses
   </b>
  </i>
  (
  <a href="#num12-1">
   12:1
  </a>
  ). This episode raises several concerns. God nominates male priests, male Levites, and male elders to run the enterprise of Israel, whereas women are all but absent. The only women we meet are Moses’ sister Miriam, who speaks (out of turn), and his Ethiopian wife, who is silent. In
  <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
   Exodus 15:20
  </a>
  , Miriam had been designated as a prophet, and she now claims a prophetic role for herself. Yet, although Miriam and Aaron both discuss Moses’ wife, it is only Miriam who is punished for her words.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The question of God’s partial administration of justice is the only one of these issues that is explored in the Rabbis’ discourse on this parashah. The tannaitic Midrash
  <i>
   Sifrei B’midbar
  </i>
  99 raises the inequity of Miriam’s treatment and answers with the words: “This shows that it was Miriam who first raised the issue.” That is, Miriam was responsible for initiating the critical conversation about Moses’ wife and thus
  <a id="page_863">
  </a>
  was the person punished. Yet, not all the Rabbis were happy with this superficial solution. In BT
  <i>
   Shabbat 97a,
  </i>
  Rabbi Akiva argues that Aaron too was afflicted with leprosy, based on the notice in
  <a href="#numv-9">
   v. 9
  </a>
  that God was “incensed with
  <i>
   them
  </i>
  ” (plural). However, this is a minority view; the general opinion in that talmudic passage is that Aaron was not similarly stricken. Another halachic midrash,
  <i>
   Sifra, M’tzora
  </i>
  5.7, identifies
  <i>
   tzaraat
  </i>
  as the quintessential punishment for slander, and it emphasizes that Miriam’s contraction of
  <i>
   tzaraat
  </i>
  (
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-10">
   Numbers 12:10
  </a>
  ) was the result of her denunciation of Moses, essentially because she slandered him behind his back.
 </div>
 <div class="image">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="image0">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The sages were also interested in solving the apparent contradiction between what we hear about Moses’ marrying an Ethiopian woman and what we know about his marriage to the Midianite woman, Zipporah (
  <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E2-16">
   Exodus 2:21
  </a>
  ). Earlier Jewish Hellenistic literature suggested that young Moses—while still an Egyptian prince—had carried out a campaign against Ethiopia and there married an Ethiopian princess (Josephus,
  <i>
   Antiquities
  </i>
  252–3). Yet the Rabbis do not adopt this solution. In their opinion, the Ethiopian woman is none other than Zipporah herself, and thus they need to explain why she is called Ethiopian—and why Miriam and Aaron found it necessary to speak about her. Already in
  <i>
   Sifrei B’midbar
  </i>
  99, we learn that Miriam spoke against Moses because he had refrained from having sexual intercourse with Zipporah ever since God had begun speaking to him face to face. The Rabbis tell us that Miriam and Zipporah had been standing together when the news came that Eldad and Medad were prophesying. Zipporah remarked that she felt pity for their wives, for they would now suffer her fate, meaning that their husbands would no longer sleep with them. Miriam then said to Aaron, “Why does Moses have to behave this way? Has not God also spoken to us, and we have not refrained from sex with our spouses?”
  <i>
   (Sifrei B’midbar
  </i>
  99). Obviously the question that bothers the Rabbis here is a contrived one, not actually found in the Bible: namely, the connection between holiness and refraining from sexual activity. It is likely that this discussion originates in rabbinic knowledge of contemporaneous non-Jewish practices that advocated celibacy of religious leaders.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  If the wife that Moses took, and about whom Miriam and Aaron spoke, was actually Zipporah, the Rabbis still needed to explain why she was designated as Ethiopian. They explained that the term
  <i>
   kushit,
  </i>
  usually translated as Ethiopian or Cushite, in fact refers to exceptional beauty. Just as Ethiopians are unusual in their skin color, so was Zipporah unusual to behold (
  <i>
   Sifrei B’midbar
  </i>
  99). This interpretation removes from the biblical text any hint of bigotry, but leaves one with the lingering feeling that Ethiopian skin color is at some level an issue.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Much of rabbinic interpretation on this episode is concerned with correct hierarchy and gender ordering. The same midrash that states that it was Miriam who initiated this conversation about Moses’ wife comments that it was unusual for her to speak to her brother Aaron before she was spoken to (
  <i>
   Sifrei B’midbar
  </i>
  99). Another early midrash teaches that if Miriam was punished for speaking against her younger brother, one should all the more so refrain from speaking against one’s superiors (
  <i>
   Sifrei D’varim
  </i>
  1). Midrash
  <i>
   D’varim Rabbah
  </i>
  6.12 notices the absence of the title “prophet” here in connection with Miriam and suggests that this is a warning that slanderous talk brings about loss of status. Midrash
  <i>
   B’reishit Rabbah
  </i>
  45.5 cites this episode to denigrate women in general as overly talkative. The import of all these texts is that women are viewed as subordinate to men and that society should endeavor to maintain men’s gender-based prerogatives.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Yet the Rabbis too are aware of Miriam’s unique status. In Mishnah
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  1:9, the notice that “the people
  <a id="page_864">
  </a>
  did not march on until Miriam was readmitted” (
  <a href="#num12-15">
   12:15
  </a>
  ) is interpreted as proof that “a human being is treated according to how that person treats others” (Mishnah
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  1:7). Miriam herself had many years earlier waited for her infant brother Moses after his mother had set him afloat in the Nile (
  <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.1-22">
   Exodus 2:4
  </a>
  ). For this, according to the Rabbis, she was rewarded at the end of
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
   Numbers 12
  </a>
  , when the Israelites did not continue their march without her.

  sacrifice; the carefully choreographed journey through the wilderness; the mutiny of meat, manna, and quail precipitating a plague for those who were led by their appetites; the challenge of Moses’ siblings to his leadership; and finally, the sudden onset of his sister Miriam’s disease. Yet amidst these richly detailed stories, we find one contrasting, stark, parsimonious prayer:
  <i>
   “El na r’fa na lah”
  </i>
  (“O God, pray heal her!”).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Five words—eleven Hebrew letters—are all that Moses speaks (
  <a href="#num12-13">
   12:13
  </a>
  ). Except for God’s name, each word ends in a vowel, as if each word were an unending cry. It is as if each word is punctuated with an exclamation point, the brevity of the syllables giving voice to the tortured helplessness of the supplicant: “God! Please! Heal! Please! Her!” In the midst of catastrophe, the verb of consequence—the bull’s-eye of the prayer—is the central plea: heal! Indeed, the prayer is nearly a palindrome—reading the same forwards as it does backwards—homing in with laser precision on that most urgent desire: heal!
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  This prayer has few words but much resonance. It is a primal cry, capturing fear, powerlessness, and incomprehensibility in the face of sudden illness, accident, or injury. It is not the entreaty of the one beset by the catastrophe, but rather that of the witness, the powerless onlooker, the potential caregiver absorbing the shock, the one who is overwhelmed and stymied about how to help.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  When illness, accident, or injury comes to those we love, it is up to us—those who are comparatively healthy and able—not only to beseech but also to provide hope and healing. For the caregiver, there is time only for truncated and hurried prayer, time only for stolen moments of naked cries and yearnings of hope. For the caregiver shouldering the burdens of action—making the loved one comfortable, researching treatment, running interference with physicians, reporting news, calming fears—prayer is a blessed moment of calm in an otherwise turbulent time.
 </div>
 <div class="image">

 <div class="tab-enin">
  When one whom we love is in danger, not only our loved one but also we ourselves face darkness. According to Jewish tradition, the first person who prayed in darkness was young Jacob, on the eve of his exile from home. The Midrash describes the confluence of physical and metaphorical darkness this way: “In order to speak to Jacob in private, God caused the sun to go down—like a king who calls for the light to be extinguished, as he wishes to speak to his friend in private”
  <i>
   (B’reishit Rabbah
  </i>
  68.10). So, too, the prayer of the caregiver is private, conspiratorial, hidden from the
  <a id="page_865">
  </a>
  one who is the object of supplication, yet revealed to the One who can respond. We want to protect the one who is suffering from the compounded weight of the caregiver’s distress. But in the darkness, it is safe to give voice to our fear of dreadful scenarios and of the unknown. In the darkness, it is a relief to relinquish the weight of trying to hold up another’s spirits, and to acknowledge that Someone with far more power than we possess is the ultimate caregiver. In the darkness, it is possible to renew courage, to find new paths, to discover the equanimity essential to living with the terror of catastrophe.

  Medical sociologist Alexandra Dundas Todd begins
  <i>
   Double Vision,
  </i>
  a memoir of her son’s treatment and recovery from brain cancer, with this reflection:
 </div>
 <div class="block1">
  “The Chinese word for crisis consists of two characters: danger and opportunity. When my son, Drew, a senior in college, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer bordering his brain, the danger was clear; the opportunity was less apparent. Danger flashed through our lives daily, while opportunities lay waiting in murky waters, to emerge only tentatively. Family closeness, the ability to savor each moment, to find strength and courage where we didn’t know they existed, to discover new methods of treatment that complemented all the surgeries and radiation and eased both body and mind, all contributed to making the unbearable bearable, turning an assault into a challenge”
  <i>
   (Double Vision: An East-West Collaboration for Coping with Cancer,
  </i>
  1994, p. xiii).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en">
  It does, indeed, take “double vision” to see both blessing and curse, to picture opportunity amidst danger. Courage grows through hope, through the willingness to look for unknown possibilities and to grasp them, through refusing to see only
  <i>
   danger
  </i>
  in darkness when its counterpart,
  <i>
   opportunity,
  </i>
  may be waiting in the shadows. The prayer of the caregiver, the cry of the distraught parent, the reassuring whisper of the loving spouse, can help to wrest some measure of opportunity out of danger.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   El na r’fa na la.
  </i>
  In its simplicity and raw clarity, this prayer of healing recognizes that more than double vision, the vision of the Divine is immeasurable, and the capacity of the Healer is limitless. In response to Moses’ prayer, God reveals the duration of Miriam’s exile to the wilderness of disease. Her fortunate loved ones have only to wait out a time of disequilibrium and uncertainty; they have received Sacred reassurance that all will be well. Yet in anticipating her return, the Torah conveys a truth well known to the loved ones of someone contending with affliction and crisis—
  <i>
   v’haam lo nasa ad heasef miryam
  </i>
  (“and the people did not march on until Miriam was readmitted,”
  <a href="#num12-15">
   12:15
  </a>
  ). Life does not go on with any sense of normalcy or progression while one whom we love is endangered; the caregiver’s attention and effort revolves around the one who is stricken. Time and space are altered. The yearning for healing expands to fill both.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Our present rituals may not be as formulaic as those described in
  <i>
   B’haalot’cha
  </i>
  ; our contemporary prayers of healing may have become longer and more specific; our modern understanding of treatment may be more nuanced and comprehensive; but Moses’ wisdom abides. The essence of what we seek is still found in his direct and eternal prayer.
