<div class="chap"><b>בהעלתך ✦<i>B’haalot’cha</i></b></div><div class="chap1"><small>NUMBERS 8:1–12:16</small><i>The Journey from Sinai Begins</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> B<small>’HAALOT’CHA</small> (“when you bring up”) chronicles, in three major units, the start of the Israelites’ journey from Mount Sinai toward the Promised Land. The first unit (8:1–9:14) concerns the Tabernacle: its rituals, special laws regarding the Levites who serve in it, and the laws concerning the passover offering. It includes the purification and consecration of the Levites. It also addresses the situation of those who, because of being ritually impure, are unable to observe the passover offering at the right time; it institutes a substitute “second Passover” (<i>pesach sheni</i>), observed a month after the original due time of the passover offering (9:9–13).</div><div class="tab-enin">The second unit (9:15–10:36) concentrates on the instructions for the traveling of the Israelites: the signals for moving ahead in the right direction and for making camp (the cloud and the trumpets). It concludes with the description of the first stage of the journey after leaving Sinai.</div><div class="tab-enin">The third unit (Numbers 11–12) dramatically illustrates the discontent of certain Israelites who begin to challenge Moses (and, less directly, God) by their complaints on this first leg of the journey, and the divine punishments that follow as a consequence. An outstanding example is when, nostalgic for the plentitude left behind in Egypt, the people complain harshly about the lack of meat. Moses reacts with deep despair—to the point of asking to die rather than bear the burden of leadership. In response to his petition concerning the burden of bearing the people all by himself, God instructs him to gather representative elders of Israel and bestow some of his spirit upon them. This approach both shares the burden and demonstrates Moses’ spiritual superiority. Paradoxically, however, Moses’ authority is challenged by two of those elders (11:26–29) and then by his own siblings, Miriam and Aaron (12:1–2). In each of these episodes, Moses appears as a patient, caring, and extremely modest leader. While the narrator emphasizes his greatness and nobility, the people are presented as rebellious and ungrateful.</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-enin">With regard to women, the parashah includes the enigmatic and disturbing story about Miriam. Moses’ sibling complains against Moses’ and his (new?) marriage to a “dark-skinned” (or “Cushite”) woman (12:1). In her challenge, Miriam—together with her brother Aaron— attempts to claim equal footing with Moses as a prophet (12:2). God punishes Miriam—not Aaron—with a skin disease because of her complaints, and she recovers only due to Moses’ intercessory prayer. Feminist interpreters often understand this story as an intended rebuke of a woman who aspires to a leadership role equal to a man’s, reading it as prejudicial to women on a number of levels. As we will see below, it is also possible to read this account more sympathetically, as a case in which God sides with one maligned woman (Moses’ wife) against a more powerful one (Miriam).</div><div class="right1"><i>—Masha Turner</i></div><div class="lefta" id="out36">

This completes the story of the Tabernacle’s erection and dedication and also concludes the story of the dedication offerings brought by Israelite chieftains at the conclusion of the previous parashah (Numbers 7), pointing out the unique “offering” that was presented by Aaron, the chieftain of Levi’s tribe. For descriptions of the lampstand and its function, see Exodus 25:31–40 and 37:17–24.</div><div class="head2" id="num_8.5-26">PURIFYING, CONSECRATING, AND APPOINTING THE LEVITES (8:5–26)<br></br></div><div class="tab-enin">Even before this parashah, a number of passages have singled out the tribe of Levi (to which Moses and Aaron belong). In Exodus, the men of Levi zealously side with Moses following the incident of the Golden Calf, wreaking vengeance on the guilty parties (Exodus 32:26). Numbers 1:46–49, 2:33, and 3:15 make clear that the men of Levi are counted separately from the other tribes in the census since they have to be dedicated to God’s service by being appointed over the holy work in the Tabernacle (1:50–54).</div><b>Take the Levites from among the Israelites and purify them.</b> Now the Levites are singled out further, this time formally dedicated to God’s service, such as by assisting the priests, the sons of Aaron. (For the purifying, consecrating, and appointing of Aaron and his sons as priests, see Exodus 28–29 and Leviticus 8.)</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="8:7–12" ref="8:7"><b></b> Moses is instructed to purify the Levites through a special ceremony.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:9"><b>community leadership.</b> Literally, “the entire community”; this translation construes the word for community, <i>edah,</i> as referring here to a representative body made up of adult males. However the terms are parsed, the entire community is to formally bestow its agreement to accept the Levites as representing it before God; but practically speaking, only a part of the Israelites will lay their hands (v. 10) on the Levites.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="8:13–20" ref="8:13"><b></b> The Levites are “set apart” as attendants to Aaron and his sons (the priests), and are <i>themselves</i> dedicated as an elevation offering before God. The Levites are further set apart as dedicated to God’s service, in lieu of the male first-born of each Israelite woman outside of the Levite tribe (8:16–17; see also at 3:12–13). As the parashah continues, it reiterates that each of the three levitical familial groupings—Gershonites, Kohathites, and Merarites (named for the grandfather and great-uncles of Moses, Miriam, and Aaron) has its own task in the Tabernacle service and its own Tabernacle components to carry (10:17, 21; compare 3:23–39).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:24"><b>twenty-five years of age.</b> The levitical service in Numbers 4:3, 23, and 30 begins at age 30.

In the context of the Levites, <i>tzava</i> means to fulfill a duty or to undertake a task.

The section concludes with a legal mandate from God, instituting a second opportunity for the people to observe the passover offering a month later. This legal mandate widens to include also Israelite householders (and perhaps others) who happen to be distant from the Tabernacle and are unable to perform the passover offering at the right time. We find four other cases in the Torah when a query prompts a new law: the case of the blasphemer (Leviticus 24:10–16); the case of the man gathering sticks on the Sabbath (Numbers 15:32–36); and twice, the case of the daughters of Zelophehad, namely Mahlah, Milcah, Noah, Hoglah, and Tirzah (see at 27:1–11 and 36:1–12).<br></br></div><b>householders.</b> The original passover offering was arranged by household (Exodus 12:3), which is the basic unit of Israelite society. This translation presumes that it is a household’s head who would normally “present” the passover sacrifice (v. 7) on behalf of the household, before sharing it with all of its members. (Presumably householders were males, a fact that would go without saying.) It is also possible that the group in question was composed of other impure individuals, women and men, not specifically householders.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="9:7–8" ref="9:7"><b></b> Moses brings the problem before God: what to do when ritual impurity bars an Israelite (who is commanded to carry out a passover sacrifice) from making the sacrifice at the designated time?</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:11"><b></b> God mandates that those unable to observe the Passover ritual at the designated time, on the fourteenth day of the first month, offer their sacrifice a month later, on the fourteenth of the following month.<br></br>[This option of an alternative passover offering a month later (what the Rabbis called “Second Passover” or <i>pesach sheni</i>) illustrates a capacity to modify time-bound obligations on account of certain circumstances. One wonders whether this precedence and flexibility could also apply when women were ritually impure because of childbirth or menstruation. However, there is no mention of such modifications regarding women. —<i>Ed</i>.]</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:14"><b>There shall be one law for you, whether stranger or citizen of the country.</b> This rule applies specifically to observing Passover but can be interpreted as a general principle that applies in other cases as well.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:18"><div class="head2a"><i>The Israelites’ Travel Protocol</i> (9:15–10:36)<br></br></div><div class="tab-en">The Israelites’ long journey from Egypt to Canaan is full of starts and stops (see 33:1–49).

Here we learn that the cloud’s coming to a halt and resting over the Tabernacle signals that they must encamp (9:17–23).</div><b>At a command of יהוה</b>.

The Torah recounts this first journey from Sinai with great pomp by describing the rank and file of the tribes and the transportation of the Tabernacle. The arrangement of the tribes reflects the status of the tribal ancestors’ mothers, namely Leah, Rachel, Bilhah, and Zilpah. (See also <i>B’midbar,</i> Another View.)<br></br></div><b></b> Finally, after all the detailed preparations, the Israelites embark from Sinai for the first time.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="10:14"><b></b> The first three tribes to embark on the journey are descended from three of the sons of Leah: Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="10:17"><b></b> The first group is followed by the dismantled Tabernacle, borne by the levitical clans of Gershon and Merari.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="10:18"><b></b> The next group that sets out are the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, who are descendants of Leah and her maid Zilpah.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="10:21"><b></b> The sons of the levitical clan of Kohath follow with the well-covered Tabernacle vessels.

Here, Moses addresses Hobab the Midianite, who until now has been staying with the Israelites in the Sinai wilderness—asking him to accompany them on their continuing journey to the Land of Israel.<br></br></div><b>Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law.</b> Hobab is either another name for Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro (father of Zipporah), or perhaps Moses’ brother-in-law. [Either way, it remains unclear what happens to Zipporah, Moses’ wife. In Exodus 18, Jethro brings his daughter back to Moses, along with “her two sons” (see Exodus 18:6); presumably these are also Moses’ children. The soon-to-be-mentioned controversy about Moses’ wife (Numbers 12) makes this question all the more pressing. —<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="10:32"><b></b> Though the dialogue between them seems incomplete, we can learn from Moses’ request how strongly he wishes Hobab to accompany Israel, and how convinced he is of the great goodness promised by God that await the Israelites upon their arrival in the land.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="10:33"><div class="head2" id="num_10.33-36">BEGINNING THE JOURNEY WITH THE ARK (10:33–36)<br></br>While the cloud leads the way before the people, thereby giving expression to God’s constant accompaniment of Israel, the Ark symbolizes God’s intimate presence among the people (see also Exodus 25:22), as well as God’s role in protecting and defending them.<br></br></div><b>traveled in front of them.</b> Whereas vv. 17–21 describe the Tabernacle as traveling <i>with</i> the camp, this passage depicts the Ark as traveling ahead of the camp.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="10:35–36" ref="10:35"><b></b> Jewish tradition has woven these verses containing Moses’ two prayers into the liturgy of the Torah service, often before and after the Torah reading.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:1"><div class="head2a"><i>Israelite Challenges to Moses and God</i> (11:1–12:16)<br></br></div><div class="tab-en">This unit describes three major challenges to Moses and God. In all three cases, fixed elements appear in a similar order: the sin of the people (or a group among the people); God’s punishment; a petition to Moses requesting that the punishment be removed; Moses’ prayer; the punishment’s termination; and the naming of the site after the episode that occurred there.</div><div class="head2" id="num_11.1-3">COMPLAINING (11:1–3)<br></br></div><div class="tab-enin">This first tale of woe—the incident at Taberah—is exceedingly concise (three verses), yet it comprises an entire story. Despite its brevity, this episode is instructive in its content and can serve as a good introduction to all three challenges in this parashah; it contains all of the fixed elements described above.</div><b>The people took to complaining.</b> This passage does not indicate what the people complained about. By not making the content of the complaint clear within these verses, the story of the incident at Taberah suggests that their sin was in the very act of complaining.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:3"><b>Taberah.</b> Heb. “fire.” The site receives its name because of the divine wrathful fire that burns there as a consequence of the people’s complaint.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:4"><div class="head2" id="num_11.4-35">CRAVING MEAT (11:4–35)<br></br>This story is more complex and developed than the tale of the complainers (11:1–3), and its plot has more twists. In contrast to the previous episode, here the people’s sin is specified: they crave meat. Moses, in anguish, places his two problems before God. How is he to carry all these people whom he did not produce? Where will he get meat to feed them? These two questions shape the structure and development of the story. God responds by commissioning seventy representative elders to help Moses and by providing meat.<br></br></div><b>“If only we had meat to eat!”</b> This statement—literally <i>“Who</i> shall give us meat to eat?”—alludes to the people’s lack of faith in God’s will and ability to provide them with meat (compare Exodus 17:7).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:5"><b>“We remember the fish.”</b> Their great craving leads them to fantasize nostalgically about the food they enjoyed in Egypt.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:6"><b>“Nothing but this manna.”</b> They express contempt for the manna, the gift of heaven, that descends from heaven each morning (Exodus 16:21). They argue that it is unvarying and boring.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:7"><b>Now the manna was like coriander seed.</b> The details about manna’s virtues refute each of the arguments that the people raise, especially their claim that the manna is dry. Their complaints, together with this report of the manna’s merits, reflect the people’s gluttony and ingratitude. Their nostalgia for Egypt, which was known as their house of bondage (as in Exodus 13:3), shows their ingratitude for all the bounty that God showered and continues to shower upon them.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:11"><b>Moses said to יהוה.</b> Moses turns to God before the punishment that befalls the people. Rather than praying that God’s punishment be lifted from the people (as in the story of the complainers, 11:1–3), Moses here bares his soul regarding his own bitter fate and complains about the difficulty of leadership.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:12"><b></b> Moses’ questions are rhetorical and the simple meaning of the verse is: “I did not produce all these people, so why do you put all this burden on me?” As he attempts to illustrate the absurdity of his situation, Moses uses motherhood as the ultimate symbol of devotion. He cites a mother’s enormous love and compassion, concern for all of her children’s needs, and boundless dedication. One way to read Moses’ questions is that he is comparing himself to that ideal mother. [The rhetorical questions also suggest that it was not Moses who was Israel’s mother, but rather God. The verbs that Moses uses specifically refer to pregnancy (<i>hariti</i>, here rendered as “produce”) and birthing (<i>yalad’ti,</i> here translated as “engender”). By implication Moses asserts that God is the one who—as it were—conceived Israel, was pregnant, gave birth to Israel, and now should carry Israel. Although Israel’s God transcends gender, the Bible contains gendered images of the Divine: male imagery is more common (see at Exodus 15:3 and Deuteronomy 32:6), but we do find female imagery for God (see the introduction to Exodus 15:22–17:16, and see at Deuteronomy 32:13, 18). Here in Numbers we have a striking depiction of God that refers to women’s activities such as giving birth. Moses uses such strong maternal language to characterize God’s unique relationship with the people. —<i>Ed</i>.]</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:13"><b>“Where am I to get meat.”</b> Before focusing on his own needs, Moses asks a question on behalf of the people.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:16"><b>“Gather for Me seventy of Israel’s elders.”</b> God offers to divide the burden of leadership between Moses and seventy representative assistants.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:17"><b>“I will draw upon the spirit that is on you.”</b> In Exodus 19, Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro, advised Moses to appoint judges in order to reduce his administrative burden. Here, the seventy elders, upon whom God bestows some of Moses’ spirit, are to be selected to fill a prophetic-spiritual role.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:18"><b>“tomorrow…you shall eat meat.”</b> God’s promise to provide meat in response to the people’s craving is also a threat, as v. 20 makes unmistakably clear.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:26"><b>they spoke in ecstasy in the camp.</b> Eldad and Medad stir up a tempest by prophesying in the camp without having Moses’ spirit bestowed upon them among the seventy elders (vv. 24–25).</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="11:27–28" ref="11:27"><b></b> First, a young assistant runs to Moses, in excitement and alarm, to inform him about this irregular behavior. Next comes Joshua, who suggests that the offenders be restrained, either as a punishment or to prevent further illegitimate prophecy.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:29"><b>“Would that all יהוה’s people were prophets.”</b> Only Moses, with enormous generosity of spirit, reacts with happiness and acceptance. He is neither threatened nor jealous but, instead, expresses a desire that there be more, rather than fewer, prophets among God’s people. (His response is all the more striking given God’s reaction to Miriam and Aaron’s boast of their prophetic gifts; see at Numbers 12.)</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="11:31–33" ref="11:31"><b></b> In response to Moses’ petition in v. 13—“Where am I to get meat?”—God supplies meat from an unexpected source: a flock of quail blown in by sea wind, which arrives at the Israelite camp. The plentiful quantity suffices for the entire people. However, the people’s craving and hunger are so great that they fall upon the birds without restraint or embarrassment, filling their mouths and bellies. Their frenzied consumption of the quails causes a plague that spreads among those who consume them.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:34"><b>Kibroth-hattaavah.</b> The people bury the many victims at a site whose name translates as “Graves of Craving.” This name indicates that the people’s sin is in craving for meat when God has already provided sufficient manna to sustain them. The Torah blames the people for not making do with manna as their food.<br></br>Generally speaking, the Torah displays a multifaceted relationship to meat consumption. Genesis 1:29 seems to advocate vegetarianism; Genesis 9:4 and Deuteronomy 12:16 allow eating meat but prohibit the consumption of blood; Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14 limit the consumption of meat to specific animals. Only in reference to meat consumption does the Torah use the verb “crave” (also Deuteronomy 12:15, 20, 21). [At the same time, priests and other Israelites are expected to eat the meat that they have together consecrated as sacrifices (see Leviticus 1–7). —<i>Ed</i>.]<br></br>If cravings for meat so angered God, then why does God supply the people with what they ask, and in such great quantities? The story indicates that God’s intent in bringing the quails is chiefly “educational,” to prove God’s unlimited powers to the people. On the one hand, God has power complete enough to satisfy all creatures’ needs, if God so desires. On the other hand, God is liable, where needed, to punish them as well.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:1"><div class="head2" id="num_12.1-16">CRITICIZING MOSES:<br/>MIRIAM, AARON, AND THE CUSHITE WOMAN (12:1–16)<br></br>The presence of two female characters stands out in this story. One, Miriam, is active and central; she constitutes the story’s axis. The other, Moses’ unnamed wife, called the “dark-skinned” or “Cushite” woman, is unseen and silent; though from her behind-the-scenes position, she is the story’s catalyst. The story constitutes a family drama of siblings who speak out against their brother and his wife.<br></br>This section contains numerous gaps, making it difficult to bridge from one verse to the next (particularly in the first three verses) and provoking a variety of questions—as discussed in turn, below.<br></br></div><b>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses.</b> The verb “spoke” is in the feminine singular form, indicating that Miriam is the chief spokesperson.<br></br><i><b>Cushite woman.</b></i> Heb. <i>cushit,</i> which may have been understood either to mean “Cushite” (that is, from Cush) or “dark-skinned.” In the Bible, Cush seems to be located in the south of Egypt, east of Sudan. However, references to <i>cushim</i> (Cushites, plural) pertain to tribes who lived in different places in Africa and Asia, as well as in the southern part of ancient Israel. The Bible refers to Cushites with awareness of their dark skin (Jeremiah 13:23). In Jeremiah 38:7–13, a Cushite saves Jeremiah’s life. In Amos 9:7, Cushites are presented as equal to Israelites in God’s view.<br></br><i><b>he had married.</b></i> Who is this woman? Have we encountered her before? Is she Zipporah, the wife of Moses and the daughter of the Midianite priest (Exodus 2:21)? If so, she may well have been “dark-skinned” (Ibn Ezra). Or, is this another wife—unnamed and mentioned in the Bible only here—a native of Ethiopia, whom Moses married in addition to Zipporah, or after Moses sent Zipporah home (see Exodus 18:2)?<br></br><i><b>“He married a Cushite woman!”</b></i> What is Miriam and Aaron’s complaint against their brother and his marriage? Are they attacking Moses for marrying a woman with dark skin? Is it a diatribe against marriage outside of the Israelite tribal structure?</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:2"><b>“Has יהוה spoken only through Moses?”</b> What connection does the previously mentioned woman bear to this complaint about Moses in relation to his siblings’ prophetic roles? The statement highlights one of several crucial gaps in this story. As prophets themselves, the siblings may think that they are entitled to the same privileged status accorded Moses. Indeed, if status is Miriam and Aaron’s primary concern, then perhaps they oppose Moses’ marriage because his wife is of the “wrong” status. Alternatively, this complaint may parallel what will be expressed by Korah and his assembly when they accuse Moses and Aaron of exalting themselves “above” God’s congregation (16:1–3).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:3"><b></b> The Torah insists that Moses, far from raising himself above others, is more modest than any other human being on earth. Moses, in his great humility, does not react or protest Miriam and Aaron’s words. That is why God now proceeds to intervene on behalf of Moses, reproaching Miriam and Aaron.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:4"><b>יהוה called to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</b> All three siblings are summoned, with Miriam in the third position—as in the words of the prophet Micah (Micah 6:4).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:6"><b>“Hear these My words.”</b> God speaks in the second person <i>plural,</i> censuring both Miriam and Aaron; but only Miriam will be punished (below). God’s verbal castigation of the siblings only addresses the issue of Moses’ prophetic leadership and not the issue of Moses’ marriage.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:7"><b>“Not so with My servant Moses.”</b> God asserts that Moses’ prophetic status is unique.

Is it because she is a woman who demands a leading position? Many commentaries hold that she—and not Aaron—is punished because she is the primary speaker against Moses. Whereas both of them complain about Moses’ prophetic status (v. 2 uses the plural verb <i>vayomru),</i> it is possible that only Miriam criticizes Moses’ marriage (v. 1 uses the feminine singular <i>va-t’daber);</i> and thus only Miriam receives God’s punishment for that criticism. Some contemporary commentators, who consider the text here to be sexist, also argue that Miriam alone is punished because she is a woman who dares challenge authority. However, if we understand the word <i>cushit</i> (“Cushite” in our translation) to mean “dark-skinned,” then Miriam may be punished for insulting a dark-skinned woman. She alone turns white (in an ironic twist) because she alone spoke out on that particular subject.<br></br><i><b>stricken with snow-white scales.</b></i> [The same words describe the temporary condition of Moses’ hand in Exodus 4:6 when God prepares him to face Pharaoh.

The full ramifications of God’s explanation remain obscure. Three points, however, are clear. First, God’s words imply that the reason for the seven days’ seclusion is shame—like the shame that befalls a daughter who was insulted by her father. This is not like the usual seclusion of the <i>m’tzora</i> (the person stricken with scale disease; see at Leviticus 13). Second, the statement (that a daughter is shamed for seven days when her father spits on her) discloses something of an assumed and accepted practice in the community. Third, the father-daughter analogy seems to soften the harshness of the incident by referring to God as father and Miriam as God’s daughter: she is still a member of God’s household, as it were (compare v. 7).<br></br><i><b>“Let her be shut out of camp for seven days.”</b></i> Miriam is to be quarantined outside the camp. Leviticus 13 prescribes a seven-day seclusion for a person stricken with <i>tzaraat</i> (a scale disease). But here God uses a different rationale for Miriam’s seclusion (see previous comment). On the relative leniency of this punishment, see the introduction to Numbers 16:1–35. Miriam’s affliction and quarantine are referred to again in Deuteronomy 24:8–9.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:15"><b>the people did not march on until Miriam was readmitted.</b> Without necessarily taking sides in Miriam’s dispute with Moses, the people demonstrate their solidarity with her by waiting until she can rejoin the camp.<br></br><i>—Masha Turner</i><br></br> </div><div class="right1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="chap" id="ano36-1"><i><b>Another View</b></i><div class="tab-en">I<small>T IS HARD TO KNOW</small> what to make of the story of Miriam: she is afflicted with snow-white scales for daring to challenge Moses—and by implication, God (12:1–16). First of all, this reader is outraged. Why is Miriam punished, but not her brother Aaron? And why is she punished at all, given the legitimacy of their complaint against Moses? Like so many passages in the Torah, <i>B’haalot’cha</i> seems to express values that are difficult to accept. Upon reflection, though, this reader’s outrage is softened—for there is much here that speaks to the power of women, even as it reflects unease about their authoritative voice.</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses has married a foreign woman and his siblings complain, perhaps upset that Moses continues to lead Israel despite violating the law while they, leaders who are guilty of no such wrong, remain subject to his authority. Imagine their surprise when God responds directly to their complaint—and their dismay when God chastises them and supports Moses. Aaron seems not to suffer for his insubordination, but Miriam’s punishment is described in detail. She is afflicted with a horrible skin ailment that threatens to place her in a state of ritual impurity and block her access to God’s holiness. As if this were not enough, she must remain outside the Israelite encampment for a full week, like a disobedient daughter shamed by her father.</div><div class="tab-enin">At first, the story of snow-white Miriam seems a perfect example of a double standard, for God permits the brother independent thought but punishes the sister for the very same ideas and words. Still, the story is more than that, for it shows us how much all of Israel valued Miriam. Her brothers plead for her, as Aaron beseeches Moses and then Moses prays to God to reverse their sister’s punishment. And the people do not respond by abandoning this victim of God’s great anger. Rather, they “did not march on until Miriam was readmitted” seven days later (v. 15), thus expressing their solidarity with the woman who in happier times led them in victory song and celebration (Exodus 15:20–21).</div><div class="right1"><i>—Beth Alpert Nakhai</i></div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot2.jpg"/></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"> </div></div><div class="chap" id="ano36-2"><i><b>Post-biblical Interpretations</b></i><div class="tab-en"> <i><b>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses</b></i> (12:1). This episode raises several concerns. God nominates male priests, male Levites, and male elders to run the enterprise of Israel, whereas women are all but absent. The only women we meet are Moses’ sister Miriam, who speaks (out of turn), and his Ethiopian wife, who is silent. In Exodus 15:20, Miriam had been designated as a prophet, and she now claims a prophetic role for herself. Yet, although Miriam and Aaron both discuss Moses’ wife, it is only Miriam who is punished for her words.</div><div class="tab-enin">The question of God’s partial administration of justice is the only one of these issues that is explored in the Rabbis’ discourse on this parashah. The tannaitic Midrash <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99 raises the inequity of Miriam’s treatment and answers with the words: “This shows that it was Miriam who first raised the issue.” That is, Miriam was responsible for initiating the critical conversation about Moses’ wife and thus was the person punished. Yet, not all the Rabbis were happy with this superficial solution. In BT <i>Shabbat 97a,</i> Rabbi Akiva argues that Aaron too was afflicted with leprosy, based on the notice in v. 9 that God was “incensed with <i>them</i>” (plural). However, this is a minority view; the general opinion in that talmudic passage is that Aaron was not similarly stricken. Another halachic midrash, <i>Sifra, M’tzora</i> 5.7, identifies <i>tzaraat</i> as the quintessential punishment for slander, and it emphasizes that Miriam’s contraction of <i>tzaraat</i> (Numbers 12:10) was the result of her denunciation of Moses, essentially because she slandered him behind his back.</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-enin">The sages were also interested in solving the apparent contradiction between what we hear about Moses’ marrying an Ethiopian woman and what we know about his marriage to the Midianite woman, Zipporah (Exodus 2:21). Earlier Jewish Hellenistic literature suggested that young Moses—while still an Egyptian prince—had carried out a campaign against Ethiopia and there married an Ethiopian princess (Josephus, <i>Antiquities</i> 252–3). Yet the Rabbis do not adopt this solution. In their opinion, the Ethiopian woman is none other than Zipporah herself, and thus they need to explain why she is called Ethiopian—and why Miriam and Aaron found it necessary to speak about her. Already in <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99, we learn that Miriam spoke against Moses because he had refrained from having sexual intercourse with Zipporah ever since God had begun speaking to him face to face. The Rabbis tell us that Miriam and Zipporah had been standing together when the news came that Eldad and Medad were prophesying. Zipporah remarked that she felt pity for their wives, for they would now suffer her fate, meaning that their husbands would no longer sleep with them. Miriam then said to Aaron, “Why does Moses have to behave this way? Has not God also spoken to us, and we have not refrained from sex with our spouses?” <i>(Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99). Obviously the question that bothers the Rabbis here is a contrived one, not actually found in the Bible: namely, the connection between holiness and refraining from sexual activity. It is likely that this discussion originates in rabbinic knowledge of contemporaneous non-Jewish practices that advocated celibacy of religious leaders.</div><div class="tab-enin">If the wife that Moses took, and about whom Miriam and Aaron spoke, was actually Zipporah, the Rabbis still needed to explain why she was designated as Ethiopian. They explained that the term <i>kushit,</i> usually translated as Ethiopian or Cushite, in fact refers to exceptional beauty. Just as Ethiopians are unusual in their skin color, so was Zipporah unusual to behold (<i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99). This interpretation removes from the biblical text any hint of bigotry, but leaves one with the lingering feeling that Ethiopian skin color is at some level an issue.</div><div class="tab-enin">Much of rabbinic interpretation on this episode is concerned with correct hierarchy and gender ordering. The same midrash that states that it was Miriam who initiated this conversation about Moses’ wife comments that it was unusual for her to speak to her brother Aaron before she was spoken to (<i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 99). Another early midrash teaches that if Miriam was punished for speaking against her younger brother, one should all the more so refrain from speaking against one’s superiors (<i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 1). Midrash <i>D’varim Rabbah</i> 6.12 notices the absence of the title “prophet” here in connection with Miriam and suggests that this is a warning that slanderous talk brings about loss of status. Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 45.5 cites this episode to denigrate women in general as overly talkative. The import of all these texts is that women are viewed as subordinate to men and that society should endeavor to maintain men’s gender-based prerogatives.</div><div class="tab-enin">Yet the Rabbis too are aware of Miriam’s unique status. In Mishnah <i>Sotah</i> 1:9, the notice that “the people did not march on until Miriam was readmitted” (12:15) is interpreted as proof that “a human being is treated according to how that person treats others” (Mishnah <i>Sotah</i> 1:7). Miriam herself had many years earlier waited for her infant brother Moses after his mother had set him afloat in the Nile (Exodus 2:4). For this, according to the Rabbis, she was rewarded at the end of Numbers 12, when the Israelites did not continue their march without her.</div><div class="right1"><i>—Tal Ilan</i></div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot2.jpg"/></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"> </div></div><div class="chap" id="ano36-3"><b><i>Contemporary Reflection</i></b><div class="tab-en"> B’<small>HAALOT</small>’<small>CHA IS OVERFLOWING</small> with complex ritual and detail: the lighting of the lamps; the purification and consecration of the Levites; the elaboration of the <i>pesach</i> sacrifice; the carefully choreographed journey through the wilderness; the mutiny of meat, manna, and quail precipitating a plague for those who were led by their appetites; the challenge of Moses’ siblings to his leadership; and finally, the sudden onset of his sister Miriam’s disease. Yet amidst these richly detailed stories, we find one contrasting, stark, parsimonious prayer: <i>“El na r’fa na lah”</i> (“O God, pray heal her!”).</div><div class="tab-enin">Five words—eleven Hebrew letters—are all that Moses speaks (12:13). Except for God’s name, each word ends in a vowel, as if each word were an unending cry. It is as if each word is punctuated with an exclamation point, the brevity of the syllables giving voice to the tortured helplessness of the supplicant: “God! Please! Heal! Please! Her!” In the midst of catastrophe, the verb of consequence—the bull’s-eye of the prayer—is the central plea: heal! Indeed, the prayer is nearly a palindrome—reading the same forwards as it does backwards—homing in with laser precision on that most urgent desire: heal!</div><div class="tab-enin">This prayer has few words but much resonance. It is a primal cry, capturing fear, powerlessness, and incomprehensibility in the face of sudden illness, accident, or injury. It is not the entreaty of the one beset by the catastrophe, but rather that of the witness, the powerless onlooker, the potential caregiver absorbing the shock, the one who is overwhelmed and stymied about how to help.</div><div class="tab-enin">When illness, accident, or injury comes to those we love, it is up to us—those who are comparatively healthy and able—not only to beseech but also to provide hope and healing. For the caregiver, there is time only for truncated and hurried prayer, time only for stolen moments of naked cries and yearnings of hope. For the caregiver shouldering the burdens of action—making the loved one comfortable, researching treatment, running interference with physicians, reporting news, calming fears—prayer is a blessed moment of calm in an otherwise turbulent time.</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-enin">When one whom we love is in danger, not only our loved one but also we ourselves face darkness. According to Jewish tradition, the first person who prayed in darkness was young Jacob, on the eve of his exile from home. The Midrash describes the confluence of physical and metaphorical darkness this way: “In order to speak to Jacob in private, God caused the sun to go down—like a king who calls for the light to be extinguished, as he wishes to speak to his friend in private” <i>(B’reishit Rabbah</i> 68.10). So, too, the prayer of the caregiver is private, conspiratorial, hidden from the one who is the object of supplication, yet revealed to the One who can respond. We want to protect the one who is suffering from the compounded weight of the caregiver’s distress. But in the darkness, it is safe to give voice to our fear of dreadful scenarios and of the unknown. In the darkness, it is a relief to relinquish the weight of trying to hold up another’s spirits, and to acknowledge that Someone with far more power than we possess is the ultimate caregiver. In the darkness, it is possible to renew courage, to find new paths, to discover the equanimity essential to living with the terror of catastrophe.</div><div class="tab-enin">Medical sociologist Alexandra Dundas Todd begins <i>Double Vision,</i> a memoir of her son’s treatment and recovery from brain cancer, with this reflection:</div><div class="block1">“The Chinese word for crisis consists of two characters: danger and opportunity. When my son, Drew, a senior in college, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer bordering his brain, the danger was clear; the opportunity was less apparent. Danger flashed through our lives daily, while opportunities lay waiting in murky waters, to emerge only tentatively. Family closeness, the ability to savor each moment, to find strength and courage where we didn’t know they existed, to discover new methods of treatment that complemented all the surgeries and radiation and eased both body and mind, all contributed to making the unbearable bearable, turning an assault into a challenge” <i>(Double Vision: An East-West Collaboration for Coping with Cancer,</i> 1994, p. xiii).</div><div class="tab-en">It does, indeed, take “double vision” to see both blessing and curse, to picture opportunity amidst danger. Courage grows through hope, through the willingness to look for unknown possibilities and to grasp them, through refusing to see only <i>danger</i> in darkness when its counterpart, <i>opportunity,</i> may be waiting in the shadows. The prayer of the caregiver, the cry of the distraught parent, the reassuring whisper of the loving spouse, can help to wrest some measure of opportunity out of danger.</div><div class="tab-enin"><i>El na r’fa na la.</i> In its simplicity and raw clarity, this prayer of healing recognizes that more than double vision, the vision of the Divine is immeasurable, and the capacity of the Healer is limitless. In response to Moses’ prayer, God reveals the duration of Miriam’s exile to the wilderness of disease. Her fortunate loved ones have only to wait out a time of disequilibrium and uncertainty; they have received Sacred reassurance that all will be well. Yet in anticipating her return, the Torah conveys a truth well known to the loved ones of someone contending with affliction and crisis—<i>v’haam lo nasa ad heasef miryam</i> (“and the people did not march on until Miriam was readmitted,” 12:15). Life does not go on with any sense of normalcy or progression while one whom we love is endangered; the caregiver’s attention and effort revolves around the one who is stricken. Time and space are altered. The yearning for healing expands to fill both.</div><div class="tab-enin">Our present rituals may not be as formulaic as those described in <i>B’haalot’cha</i>; our contemporary prayers of healing may have become longer and more specific; our modern understanding of treatment may be more nuanced and comprehensive; but Moses’ wisdom abides. The essence of what we seek is still found in his direct and eternal prayer. <i>El na r’fa na la:</i> God! Please! Heal! Please! Her!</div><div class="right1"><i>—Patricia Karlin-Neumann</i></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"> </div></div>
