<div class="chap2" id="ch-2"><i>Beginning Again
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> N<small>OACH</small> (Noah), named after the head of the household that survives the Flood, continues the basic themes of Genesis 1–11, accounting for the human condition with its possibilities and perils. The stories express a conviction that God persists—despite repeated disappointments—in (re)adjusting expectations in response to human limitations.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Two individuals, living ten generations apart, frame the parashah: Noah (6:9) and Abram/Abraham (11:27–32). Each becomes a vehicle for God’s persistence in “beginning again.” Between these two looms the devastating flood in response to human transgression, followed by God’s renewed effort to restore harmony through a covenant with Noah and all creation. The covenant redefines the relationship between God and humankind.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The tale of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11) follows the flood story, as yet another case of human disobedience and divine response. It accounts for linguistic diversity and also demonstrates God’s covenantal restraint when humankind once again seeks to go beyond bounds. Finally, the introduction of Abram and Sarai that concludes the parashah prepares the stage for stories about the ancestral family—and about the descendants, the Israelites, who are the subject of the rest of the Bible.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Women’s presence in this parashah is more implicit than explicit until the very end, when Sarai/Sarah receives more attention than her husband Abram/Abraham (11:29–30). Her condition, that of a barren woman, introduces the challenge that propels the plot of the next several Torah portions, namely: How can God’s promises of progeny be fulfilled? Noah’s wife, the new mother of humankind, is mentioned several times but never named (though some rabbis later identify her as Naamah of Genesis 4:22). The virtual absence of women’s stories and names is all the more striking given the emphasis on women in the previous parashah and the lengthy, patrilineal genealogies in this one. Feminine presence is detected, however, in three basic ways: the (unnamed) wives of Noah and “his” sons; the emphasis on the animals who embark the ark as male and female; and the overwhelming presence of <i>t’hom</i>, “the deep”—a feminine noun evoking the name of the Babylonians’ salt-water goddess, Tiamat. <i>T’hom</i> first appears in Genesis 1:2 as a subdued presence. Riled into action by God, <i>t’hom</i> in this Torah portion unleashes its waters and destroys all that lives on land (see at 7:1).

The parallels between the biblical and Babylonian versions are extensive and striking. They share a basic plot: the divine anger leads to a flood aiming to eradicate humankind. Many details are strikingly similar: one individual is told to build a boat to carry a select few to safety; the instructions for the boat, including the requirement for a window, are often parallel; and a raven and a dove go out to test the conditions in the aftermath. There can be no doubt that Babylonian traditions influenced the biblical version. The most significant differences between the two lie in the cause for the flood: in the BabyIonian myth, the gods unleash the flood because human noise angers them; in Genesis, human violence prompts God to unleash the flood. In the Babylonian versions, the hero receives immortality as a gift from the gods. What the biblical hero receives is a covenant from God that promises the “immortality” of humankind. According to Tikva Frymer-Kensky, the biblical flood is not primarily a punishment but “a means of getting rid of the thoroughly polluted world and starting again with a well-washed one” (“The <i>Atrahasis</i> Epic and Its Significance for Our Understanding of Genesis 1–9,” <i>Studies in Bible and Feminist Criticism,</i> 2006, p. 62). The laws that God gives Noah in Genesis 9:1–7 seek to prevent the kind of bloodshed that pollutes the land.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The description of the flood shows an interweaving of separate versions, illustrating a commitment to more than one voice in telling the story. Scholars of the Torah’s historical development identify two major strands: “J” (also called “Yahwist,” a Judean source) and “P” (Priestly source), each with its own characteristics (see the introduction to Genesis).
</div></div><div class="head2" id="ge_6.9-8.14" ref="6:9">THE FLOOD (6:9–8:14)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:9"><b>Noah was a righteous man.</b> Already introduced in the previous parashah as the hope of both humankind (5:28–29) and God (6:8), Noah is the bearer of potential comfort. His father had named him as such, a bringer of <i>n'chamah</i> (“comfort,” a pun on the name <i>Noach)</i> to reverse the cursed condition of the earth (5:29).<br></br><i><b>in his generation.</b></i> Whether this qualification intends to diminish his virtue (meaning, “only when compared to others in that era of utter violence”) or enhance it (meaning “even in the midst of a corrupt generation”) remains unspecified.<br></br><i><b>walked with God.</b></i> The phrase indicates special intimacy. In the Bible, only Enoch (5:22) and Noah receive such a high compliment. God asks Abraham to “walk <i>before</i> me” (17:1), possibly an even more demanding request than walking <i>with</i> God.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:10"><b>Noah begot three sons.</b> This information was first reported in 5:32. No mother is mentioned, for generational continuity and transmission of property in ancient Israel focused on the male lineage. However, in the context of lineages, it generally goes without saying that women are essential to the household and to society.<br></br><i><b>Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</b></i> Each of the three sons represents a general linguistic or ethnic group in existence when the Torah was composed. According to 10:1–26, Shem is ancestor of the Semites to which Israel and the Arab peoples belong. Ham is ancestor of the African peoples and Japheth of the Greeks. Noah will later establish a hierarchy among them (9:24–27).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:11"><b>–7:23.</b> In the Babylonian flood stories, the gods are angry at humankind because people have become a nuisance, disturbing the peace. Genesis, instead, makes unchecked human violence the reason for God’s drastic action of wiping out all living creatures—returning the world to primeval chaos.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:11"><b>violence.</b> Tikva Frymer-Kensky points out that this Hebrew word, <i>chamas,</i> “in the Bible encompasses almost the entire spectrum of evil” (“The <i>Atrahasis</i> Epic,” <i>Studies in Bible,</i> 2006, p. 61). After the flood, God gives Noah prohibitions regarding bloodshed, which suggests that bloodshed was the main concern.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="6:13–22" ref="6:13"><b>6:13.</b> The ark that God instructs Noah to build is intended to provide for the future by saving Noah, his family, and the representative animals.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:13"><b>God said…“I am going to wipe them off.”</b> The narrator had first mentioned God’s decision to destroy humankind in 6:5–7. The report that divine beings married earthly women in what seemed like a violation of the boundary between heaven and earth (6:1–4) may also be a factor in God’s decision.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:14"><b>“Make yourself an ark.”</b> The word <i>tevah</i> (ark) literally means a box. It appears again only in Exodus 2:3–5, when Moses’ mother makes one for her newborn. In both cases, the ark carries the future, as it were.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:18"><b>“With you, though, I will establish My covenant.”</b> This first mentioned covenant will encompass all of Noah’s descendants, and thus all humankind, as well as the entire natural world (see Genesis 9:8–17).<br></br><i><b>“go…you, your wife, your sons, and their wives with you.”</b></i> As sole survivors, they constitute all humankind.<br></br>For the first time, Noah’s unnamed wife is mentioned, along with the wives of his sons (not <i>her</i> sons or <i>their</i> sons). The wording reflects the patrilineal nature of the ancient society; see above at v. 10.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:19"><b>male and female.”</b> Provision for continued procreation involves female and male creatures.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:1"><b><i>7:1.</i></b> Noah’s righteousness merits the saving of his entire household, the basic unit of ancient Near Eastern society. Whereas the hero of the Babylonian flood story tries to warn his neighbors and persuade them to join him in the ark, Noah does not attempt to include or reform others.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:2"><b><i>7:2.</i></b> God further provides for the future by ensuring the procreation of animals (rather than creating them anew). Pure animals are those fit for sacrifice.<br></br><i><b>“male and its mate.”</b></i> Heb. <i>ish v’ishto,</i> words that are sometimes used in biblical language to designate members of a group, human or otherwise. (See further at 2:23.)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:7"><b>Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives came into the ark.</b> Noah’s wife and his sons’ wives are mentioned several times without names. See above at 6:18.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:11"><b>–8:14.</b> The Flood is more than an overflow of water; it represents a return to primeval chaos, with water breaking through the boundaries created in Genesis 1 to form and protect the earth. The floodgates open from above and below, letting the waters wipe out everything. The details of the story show inconsistencies that expose the seams where two accounts are woven together. The actual flood lasts 40 days (7:17), yet waters continue to rise for 150 days (7:24), subsiding for 40 days plus 14 (8:6).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:11"><b>the great deep.</b> Heb. <i>t’hom,</i> a noun also found in 1:2, echoes the name of the Mesopotamian goddess Tiamat. But now she bursts forth with the ferocity familiar from the Babylonian Creation story Enuma Elish. Primordial <i>t’hom,</i> like the awesome goddess Tiamat, has been often maligned. According to the Enuma Elish, Tiamat’s children, led by the god Marduk, provoke her wrath by killing her husband. When she tries to retaliate, they destroy her and use her body to form the world. In the Bible, <i>t’hom</i> is typically associated with the uncontrollable and immeasurable. Catherine Keller, however, shows the nuanced ways in which <i>t’hom</i> as “the deep,” infinite and fertile, also functions as a partner with God in creation (<i>The Face of the Deep: A Theology of Becoming,</i> 2003, pp. 213–228). See also the positive reference to <i>t’hom</i> in Psalm 42:8, “deep <i>(t’hom)</i> calls to deep <i>(t’hom).”</i></div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="7:21–23" ref="7:21"><b>7:21.</b> The destruction of all land-based animal life on earth is vividly recorded. Words such as “perished” and “blotted out” make clear that no one survives except “Noah and those with him in the ark” (v. 23).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:1"><b>God then remembered Noah.</b> God turns attention to Noah and begins to restore the world to order by reversing the direction of the waters. Remembering connotes acting, as when God remembers Rachel (Genesis 30:22) and she conceives.<br></br><i><b>wind.</b></i> Heb. <i>ruach,</i> the same word as in 1:2 (where it was rendered “spirit”). The Flood reverses Creation, and the aftermath is a new Creation that recalls Genesis 1.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:4"><b>Ararat.</b> Tradition associates this name with a mountainous district near the intersection of Turkey and Armenia. Explorers who consider the Flood narrative to be history rather than story peri odically claim (unconvincingly) to have found remnants of the ark there.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="8:6–10" ref="8:6"><b>raven… dove.</b> The same birds appear in the Mesopotamian flood stories. Their flight patterns indicate the scope of destruction—and portend renewal.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:11"><b>olive branch.</b> Returning, the dove demonstrates that plant life is visible again. The olive branch becomes a symbol of renewal and peace in the aftermath of devastation.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:12"><b>the dove…no longer came back.</b> A final sign that the world was habitable again.</div><div class="head2" id="ge_8.15-9.17" ref="8:15">TRANSFORMATION, COVENANT, AND RENEWAL (8:15–9:17)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:15"><b>“Go out…with your wife, your sons, and their wives.”</b> God’s instructions imply that the world again is hospitable to living beings. Whereas the narrator groups Noah with his sons, followed by his wife with the sons’ wives (7:7 and 8:18), God pairs Noah with his wife and the sons with theirs.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:18"><b>Noah went out, together with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives.</b> The writer leaves it to the reader to imagine the feelings of Noah and his family as they disembark. Compare the order in v. 15.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="8:20–22" ref="8:20"><b>8:20.</b> God reassesses humankind’s nature and accepts human limitations. The anthropomorphic description of a God who responds and recants at the pleasing smell of sacrifice makes some modern readers uneasy. More striking is the basis of God’s change of heart. The reason for not destroying life again is virtually the same as the reason for the flood: human beings incline to evil from their youth. In other words, God—not humankind—changes as a result of the flood.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:21"><b>“inclines to evil from youth onward.”</b> God recognizes that the inclination to do evil is part of human beings. God’s observation does not claim that humans are inherently sinful but rather recognizes human limitations. God’s subsequent laws reflect God’s new awareness.<br></br><i><b>“never again will I destroy.”</b></i> The promise is momentous. It will be reiterated in the covenant that follows (see especially 9:11).</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="9:1–7" ref="9:1"><b>9:1.</b> The transgressions that led to the Flood transform God’s expectations. They result in new rules to guide humankind and a promise of a perpetual covenant. God’s blessings and God’s new instructions signal a new beginning. Only the command to procreate unites this commissioning with the first one in Genesis 1:28.<br></br>New guidelines aim at channeling impulses and containing them. The values are inscribed in the laws: life is precious, human life especially so. Several notable elements differentiate this renewal from the earlier commissioning of humankind. Eating meat (with some qualifications) is now permitted, perhaps as a concession to human need for aggression (9:4). Bloodshed is to be controlled. In particular, the sanctity of human life is announced (9:6). The absence of women in this text contrasts with the earlier blessings in Genesis 1. In split-screen fashion, an inclusive vision is also present meanwhile in the references to <i>adam,</i> the generic human being who is (still) in God’s image (9:6).<br></br>Later rabbinic tradition expanded the laws in this section into seven “Noachite laws” that are binding upon all humankind.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="9:1"><b>“Be fruitful and multiply.”</b> This exact repetition of the original command (1:28) takes on new poignancy in light of the destruction that preceded; now it stands for regenerating life after deathdealing disasters.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="9:4"><b><i>9:4.</i></b> Eating meat appears as a concession, not a requirement. (The original diet for both humans and beasts was vegetarian in 1:29–30.)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="9:5"><b>“bloodguilt.”</b> God singles out human life for special care. God demands restitution for the shedding of human blood.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="9:6"><b>“The shedder of human blood.…”</b> The very formulation expresses parity between crime and punishment: the first six words repeat in exact mirror image: <i>spill—blood—human</i> / <i>human—blood— spill.</i> The message is both simple and profound: complete parallel between deed and consequence—no more, no less. This formulation resembles the “eye for an eye” principle (Exodus 21:24). Less clear is how such a guideline is to be carried out.<br></br><i><b>“in the image of God.”</b></i> Because humankind is made in God’s image, murder counts as a crime against God.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="9:8–17" ref="9:8"><b>9:8.</b> The covenant emphasizes renewal. It also offers the assurance of security to humankind. The covenant reiterates the perpetuity of its promise (9:9, 12) and its expansive scope, encompassing all living beings (9:9–10, 12, 15, 16, 17). Only Noah and his sons are addressed (9:8). God guarantees that no flood will ever eradicate all life on earth.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="9:13"><b>“My bow.”</b> A weapon is transformed into a symbol of peace.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="9:15"><b><i>9:15.</i></b> God promises to never cause another global flood.</div><div class="head2" id="ge_vv-18.29" ref="9:18">THE AFTERMATH : NOAH AND HIS SONS (9:18–29)<br></br>The misbehavior of Noah’s youngest son Ham leads to the cursing of Ham’s youngest son Canaan. Unfortunately, this episode has been used by white colonizers to justify the exploitation of Africans, since Ham (in Genesis) is the ancestor of the people of Africa. However, it is not God but Noah—one might even add “under the influence”—who utters the curse; and God does not legitimate it.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="9:22–25" ref="9:22"><b>9:22.</b> Realizing that his son Ham saw him naked, Noah utters a curse. The story aims at asserting the dignity of the father and rewards those who cover the father’s nakedness. Many details remain unexplained, leaving irresolvable problems that later interpreters attempt to excuse. Why is Canaan punished for his father’s indiscretion? The story does not answer such questions. Rather, it functions as an etiology for Canaanite-Israelite tensions that will appear in later biblical accounts. Contemporary scholars hold that, historically speaking, Israel emerged mainly out of, and sought to distinguish itself from, a Canaanite population. The present story may seek to justify such a separation (compare Deuteronomy 7).<br></br><i><b>nakedness.</b></i> Heb. <i>ervah,</i> which differs from the word for naked in Genesis 2:25 (<i>arumim</i>). <i>Ervah</i> always has sexual connotations; uncovering relatives’ <i>ervah</i> incurs severe punishment under the Sinai covenant (see, for example Leviticus 18:6–19 and 20:10–21).</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="9:25–27" ref="9:25"><b>9:25.</b> The curse of Canaan and his enslavement by the other two families aims to discredit Canaan, a people who posed a challenge to Israel’s identity.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="head2a" ref="10:1"><i>The Table of Nations</i> (10:1–32)<div class="tab-en">Reflecting God’s command to multiply, the list charts patterns of presumed kinship, as well as a linguistic and geographical “map” of the ancient world as understood in biblical times. Some of the information corresponds to known data; some conflicts with available information; and some cannot be identified. Roughly speaking, the divisions correspond to those in Asia (Shem), Europe (Japheth), and Africa (Ham), but the pattern is inconsistent. Seventy names represent the nations of the world.
</div></div><div class="tab-en1" ref="10:1"><b>This is the line.</b> Biblical genealogies presume that the head of the household stands for the household as a whole, including its women (and subordinate men)—an assumption shared throughout the Bible and the ancient Near East. Thus biblical genealogies rarely mention mothers, wives, or daughters. (Exodus 6:14–25 is one exception.) In fact, however, the women cemented relationships among patrilineally defined groups via marriage.<br></br>Women must have been integral to Israelite kinship, for biblical stories take for granted that men who are related to each other only through a woman treat each other as kin (see Genesis 19:12, 14; Judges 9:1–3; II Samuel 13:37 in light of 3:3; 21:4–8). Nor is patrilineage always sufficient to identify oneself: Rebekah and Jacob each mention female ancestry (Genesis 24:24; 29:12). As for biblical law, see at Leviticus 18:10. While female-mediated kinship ties are not recounted in standard genealogical lists, they nevertheless formed part of the social structure (David Stein, personal communication).</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="10:15–20" ref="10:15"><b>Canaan.</b> The spread of Canaan is especially relevant to Israel’s history, and the cities listed play a role in subsequent narratives.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="10:19"><b>Sodom, and Gomorrah.</b> Genesis 19 reports that these cities were destroyed because of their inhabitants’ wickedness.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="10:21–31" ref="10:21"><b>Shem too had progeny.</b> Abraham—and thus Israel—belong to his line.

This interlude, which interrupts the genealogy of Shem, accomplishes a number of things in very few lines: it reiterates the theme of humankind trying to go too far (again), accounts for linguistic diversity, and establishes the ignominious beginning of Babylon, Israel’s eventual oppressor.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Less obviously, the story also expresses a significant theological message about God’s new relationship with humankind. The story’s taut, concise structure depicts divine response as mirroring human action very precisely. In sharp contrast to the indiscriminating response with the Flood, God’s measured retribution demonstrates a system in which the “punishment” fits the “crime” (as noted in 9:6).
</div><div class="tab-en1">The word play on “name” <i>(shem),</i> “sky” <i>(shamaim),</i> “there” <i>(sham)</i> cannot be reproduced in English but pinpoints the issues: humankind attempts to reach the sky <i>(shamaim)</i> thereby to make a name <i>(shem)</i> for itself, instead of spreading out as God has demanded. A contrast with the line of Shem (which also means “name”) is also at work (v. 10).
</div><div class="tab-en1">Contrary to some expectations, God prefers diversity to unity and uniformity (v. 6) and, in this story, actively promotes it.
</div></div><div class="tab-en1" ref="11:1"><b>language…words.</b> “Language” in Hebrew is a feminine noun also meaning “lip.” Contemporary discussions about the tension between the written and the oral traditions use such distinctions to differentiate between a female culture (“language” as oral) and a male one (“word” as written).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="11:3"><b>“let us.”</b> This language will be repeated when God responds, measure for measure.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="11:4"><b>“a tower that reaches the sky.”</b> The goal, to reach the sky (<i>shamaim</i>) and make a name <i>(shem)</i> for the builders, doubly offends divine prerogative: it is an incursion into God’s physical domain and also usurps God’s role in bestowing a name, which implies honor and legacy. The tower reflects and ridicules the Babylonian ziggurat, a massive “holy mountain” constructed of bricks that was the hallmark of Mesopotamian cities: it marked the meeting point of heaven and earth.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="11:6"><b>“no scheme…beyond their reach.”</b> God identifies human ambition and complete unity as a dangerous mix. Diversity seems to be by divine design.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="11:7"><b>“Let us.”</b> In language that closely parallels the human words in v. 3, God dismantles the human project point by point (brick by brick?). God uses the people’s words but with different meanings—most of which cannot be adequately reproduced in English, such as the use of <i>l-b-n,</i> which permutates as <i>libnot</i> (build), <i>I’benah</i> (brick), and <i>n’belah</i> (confuse). (On “us” in God’s speech, see at 1:26.)

However, we learn nothing further about her.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="11:30"><b>Sarai was barren.</b> Fertility stands out as a paramount concern in biblical tales, starting with Genesis 1:28. Sarai’s lack of children will become the pivot around which the stories from Genesis 12–21 revolve. | In Genesis 16:2, Sarai will attribute her condition to God. However, the narrator nowhere suggests that God afflicted her with such a condition or that it is a stigma. Fertility of the barren women becomes a symbol of God’s special blessing, without implying necessarily that lack of fertility is a punishment. | Stories about barren women subordinate the role of human beings in fertility and instead highlight God’s role. See further Another View. | This first mention of Sarah/ Sarai, portraying her as a barren woman, contrasts with the Bible’s final mention of Sarah, invoking her as a message of hope for a “barren” people in exile: “Look back to Abraham your father / And to Sarah who brought you forth” (Isaiah 51:2).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="11:31"><b>his daughter-in-law Sarai,</b> The Hebrew actually adds also “wife of Abram.” This double mention of Sarai’s identity emphasizes her role in the family and prepares the reader for her continued prominence in the stories that follow. The report about the family’s journey from Ur sets the stage for God’s attempt to “begin anew,” this time with the family of Abram and Sarai.<br></br><i>—Tamara Cohn Eskenazi</i><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div class="right1"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="chap" id="ano2-0"><div class="tab-en"><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg27.jpg"/> A <small>GENEALOGY IS</small> a typical narrative strategy to account for the long passage of time and also to express the relationships among groups. In this parashah, the concluding genealogy leads to Abram and Sarai (11:27–32). It is shocking that this genealogy ends with the information that Sarai is barren, a statement that counters the very notion of genealogy, namely, family connectedness across generations.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The theme of barrenness is emphasized in the story of the ancestors, beginning with Sarah, the first matriarch; and it recurs in the next two generations, with Rebekah (25:21) and then Rachel (29:31). The idea of a barren woman giving birth highlights the importance of the offspring, calling attention to God’s role in the child’s birth—and thus to the significance of the child.
</div><div class="tab-enin">At the same time, the presence of the barrenness theme in matriarchal narratives signifies the values and concerns of an agrarian people. Most Israelites were self-sufficient farmers, requiring a team of people to work the land; having offspring therefore meant survival. It also meant the opportunity to raise an heir who would intimately know and maintain that parcel of land. Family lands were held as patrimonies and passed down across generations. Not surprisingly, legal precepts in the Torah aimed at helping families retain their property (see Leviticus 25:23–28).
</div><div class="tab-enin">In light of the great importance of land as inheritance, barrenness was a grave problem. Archeology has produced artifacts, such as small female figurines, that arguably were used, along with prayers, in household rituals women surely performed to deal with infertility. Also, potions and remedies to overcome barrenness are known from the texts of other ancient Near Eastern peoples and later Jewish folklore; and surely they were used by Israelite women (see the mandrake of Genesis 30:14–16).
</div><div class="tab-enin">In addition, like other ancient peoples, the Israelites solved this problem by allowing for adoption or polygyny (multiple wives). A householder could take a second wife or secondary wife (a servant or a concubine), and the resulting offspring would allow the lineage—reckoned along the male line—to continue and the land to remain in the family. For elite families, especially royalty, having multiple wives was a sign of status; in ordinary families it was a solution to the dire predicament of the barrenness of a man’s initial wife.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano2-1"><div class="tab-en"><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg28.jpg"/> <i><b>“your wife”</b></i> (6:18). Noah’s wife is mentioned five times in the Flood story (Genesis 6:18; 7:7, 13; 8:16, 18) but she is never named. While she is not the only woman (or man) to go unnamed in Hebrew Scriptures, the Rabbis were curious about her identity. Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 23.3 preserves a dispute about her name, in which one rabbi argues that Noah’s wife was Naamah, the “sister of Tubal-Cain,” a descendant of Adam and Eve’s son Cain, who is listed in the genealogies in Genesis 4:22. He justifies his view with the explanation that the name derives from the word “pleasant” and that Noah’s wife’s actions were pleasing (<i>n’imim</i>) to God. However, the majority opinion in <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 23.3 rejects the identification of Noah’s wife with the Naamah of 4:22 since “her name indicates that she sang (<i>man'emet)</i> to the timbrel in honor of idolatry.”
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives came into the ark</b></i> (7:7). Noah’s family and the animals were chosen for preservation on the ark in male-female pairs, in order to ensure the continuation of their species after the Flood. However, a midrash in the Talmud (BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 108b) teaches that this process of “continuation” did not begin on the ark. Careful attention to the word order shows that the genders were separated at the boarding of the ark. The midrash contrasts this with the wording of Genesis 8:16 where the instructions for disembarking are given to marriage groupings. That is, Noah was instructed that he should leave first with his wife, and then his sons with their wives. Thus, the authors of this midrash demonstrate that the sexes were segregated on board, at least enough that they did not have sexual contact on the ark. However, when they disembarked, each male, together with the appropriate female, they were to resume normal sexual relations.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Abram’s wife was named Sarai…Haran father of Milcah and of Yiscah</b></i> (11:29). The text introduces us to Abraham, who at this point is still referred to by his pre-covenantal name, Abram. Similarly, his wife Sarah is also referred to here by her pre-covenantal name, Sarai. However, the Rabbis noticed that the first time Sarai is mentioned, her family is not identified. Yet in the same verse, Milcah—the wife of Abram’s brother Nahor—is identified as the daughter of Haran; in addition and for no obvious reason, <i>her</i> sister Yiscah is then mentioned. The following verse (Genesis 11:30) resumes Sarai’s story once again. It is probably the juxtaposition of all of these characters, as well as the rabbinic desire to link Sarai to the larger family, that explains a midrashic tradition that Sarai and Yiscah were in fact the same person. (The idea of marrying a niece would not have seemed unusual in the biblical or rabbinic eras. It is not one of the incestuous relationships forbidden in Leviticus 18.) The Talmud explains this conflation of Sarah with Yiscah (BT <i>M’gillah</i> 14a) linguistically. The Hebrew letters that spell the name Yiscah are similar to the Hebrew verb “to look” (<i>s-c-h).</i> Thus, based on midrashic traditions of Sarah’s great beauty, the Rabbis explain that Sarai was called Yiscah because everyone wanted to <i>look</i> at her. A second explanation offered is that Sarai was called Yiscah because she was a prophet and could <i>look</i> into the future.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>And Sarah was barren; she had no offspring</b></i> (11:30). The Talmud (BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 64b) understands this double description of Sarah’s infertility to have two meanings. The first phrase, <i>was barren,</i> means Sarah did not have children; and the second phrase, <i>she had no offspring,</i> indicates she was missing the vital internal organs necessary for conception and pregnancy. Thus, the later birth of Isaac was doubly miraculous.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano2-2"><div class="tab-en"><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg29.jpg"/> <small>GENESIS BEGINS</small> with God’s creation of the world by word alone: <i>God said, “Let there be light!”</i> (1:3). At the end of Genesis 1, <i>God surveyed all that [God] had made, and look—it was very good!</i> With language God created the world, separated the waters above from the waters below, named, judged, and expressed great satisfaction with the results. But by the end of <i>parashat B’reishit,</i> we read that יהוה <i>saw how great was the wickedness of human beings.…So</i> יהוה <i>thought: “I will wipe the humans whom I created from off the face of the earth"</i> (6:5–7).
</div><div class="tab-enin">In <i>parasht Noach,</i> what sin had the people committed to warrant the Flood? The fact that so many different answers have been offered suggests that there is no clear answer. Some interpreters say that the wrongdoing was miscegenation: the interbreeding between the sons of God and the daughters of mankind (6:1–4). Others in traditional sources postulate that it was the sin of refusing to have children—indeed, even Noah waited until he was 500 years old to have his first child.
</div><div class="tab-enin">For all the various theories about the precise nature of the sin, it is clear that the Flood’s essential purpose was to cleanse Creation of the flaw that led to its corruption. And yet, from the time of the Ark’s landing on dry land, God demonstrates an awareness that some essential flaw persists. God says: <i>Never again will I bring doom upon the world on account of what people do, though the human mind inclines to evil from youth onward</i> (8:21). Why does the human mind incline to evil? What is the flaw in the human mind? While the questions are not explicitly answered, we can nevertheless find answers in our tradition.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Many commentators have criticized Noah for not challenging God about the planned destruction, as Abraham later does when God reveals the plan to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah (18:17–33). Readers over the ages have been puzzled by Noah’s silence. But his silence is precisely the point. Nearly the entire portion of <i>Noach</i> is filled with God’s speech and Noah’s actions—but not words. From his building the ark through the entire Flood, Noah utters not a single word. When Noah finally speaks after being <i>awakened from his wine</i> (9:24), his words disclose the problem: he <i>understood what his youngest son had done to him, so he said “Damned be Canaan! To his brothers he shall be the basest of slaves!"</i> (9:24–25).
</div><div class="tab-enin">So Noah’s first words neither praise God, nor express gratitude, nor ask for help, nor proclaim justice. Instead, he uses language to curse and to set up the differentiated love that will plague all the offspring of Genesis—from Ishmael and Isaac to Esau and Jacob, and to Joseph and his brothers. By “differentiated love” I mean love that is given to one person and withheld from another.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Noah’s first words show what might be an essential flaw in creation, leading to destruction in this parashah. As we read in Proverbs 18:21, <i>death and life are in the power of the tongue.</i> We have already seen the creative power of language in Genesis 1. Now it becomes clear that one sin causing the Flood was the abuse of language. In a way, we have always known that, as the Confession for the Day of Atonement lists many forms of language: idle talk, offensive speech, foolish talk, slander, passing judgment, plotting, talebearing, and swearing falsely. Each of these offenses involves some abuse of language.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In <i>parashat Noach,</i> the inherent flaw is made clear. Noah’s words form a curse; moreover, even when he comes to bless (9:27), he does so comparatively, blessing one son at the expense of another son’s son, relegating his grandson Canaan to the role of slave. But love should not be comparative, quantifiable, or conditional.
</div><div class="tab-enin">God acknowledges the power of human language in the very next story, the episode of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11). This time God, in order to restrain the people who are reaching out to heaven, confuses the language. God is thus undermining their capacity to use language in a destructive fashion (11:1–6).
</div><div class="tab-enin">From Noah’s words and the people’s words when they attempt to build their tower, we learn that the language that survives the devastation of the Flood is that of differentiated love, competition, hatred, cursing, and revenge across generations. God’s action at Babel is an attempt to heal the flaw of the sin at Babel by multiplying languages: perhaps somewhere among the new tongues would emerge a vision of reality that transcends the destructive, condemning words carried forward in the ark.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Our own experience verifies the lesson of the sin of the Flood. We know how language can kill. We have seen the medical charts on which a doctor has scribbled “untreatable,” thereby sealing a patient’s fate. We have labeled a plant in our garden a “weed,” thus sealing its fate.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Silence, then, might be a virtue. During the long days of the Flood and its aftermath, Noah did well, being silent. His silence reminds us of the better part of Job’s comforters who initially <i>sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights. None spoke a word to him for they saw how very great was his suffering</i> (Job 2:13). Once they began to speak, though, their words brought only discomfort, and finally God rebuked them: <i>for you have not spoken the truth about Me as did My servant Job</i> (42:7).
</div><div class="tab-enin">What lessons may we draw from this juxtaposition of silence and language? Is human speech invariably destructive? Where can we find the language that blesses, heals, and even creates? Again, the model is within this parashah, when God responds.
</div><div class="tab-enin">God restricts divine power, saying: <i>Never again will I bring doom upon the world on account of what people do</i> (Genesis 8:21); God restores blessings: <i>God then blessed Noah and his sons saying to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth”</i> (9:1); and God enters into covenant with all living creatures: <i>I am going to establish My covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living being in your care</i> (9:9–10).
</div><div class="tab-enin">God’s words and actions in the aftermath of destruction show us how we can use language to repair relationships, instruct others, forgive, and bless.
