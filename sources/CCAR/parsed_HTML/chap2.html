  (Noah), named after the head of the household that survives the Flood, continues the basic themes of
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1–11
  </a>
  , accounting for the human condition with its possibilities and perils. The stories express a conviction that God persists—despite repeated disappointments—in (re)adjusting expectations in response to human limitations.

 <div class="tab-en1">
  Two individuals, living ten generations apart, frame the parashah: Noah (6:9) and Abram/Abraham (
  <a href="#ge_11.27-32">
   11:27–32
  </a>
  ). Each becomes a vehicle for God’s persistence in “beginning again.” Between these two looms the devastating flood in response to human transgression, followed by God’s renewed effort to restore harmony through a covenant with Noah and all creation. The covenant redefines the relationship between God and humankind.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The tale of the Tower of Babel (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_11.1-9">
   Genesis 11
  </a>
  ) follows the flood story, as yet another case of human disobedience and divine response. It accounts for linguistic diversity and also demonstrates God’s covenantal restraint when humankind once again seeks to go beyond bounds. Finally, the introduction of Abram and Sarai that concludes the parashah prepares the stage for stories about the ancestral family—and about the descendants, the Israelites, who are the subject of the rest of the Bible.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Women’s presence in this parashah is more implicit than explicit until the very end, when Sarai/Sarah receives more attention than her husband Abram/Abraham (
  <a href="#ge_11.27-32">
   11:29–30
  </a>
  ). Her condition, that of a barren woman, introduces the challenge that propels the plot of the next several Torah portions, namely: How can God’s promises of progeny be fulfilled? Noah’s wife, the new mother of humankind, is mentioned several times but never named (though some rabbis later identify her as Naamah of
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_4.1-6.8">
   Genesis 4:22
  </a>
  ). The virtual absence of women’s stories and names is all the more striking given the emphasis on women in the previous parashah and the lengthy, patrilineal genealogies in this one. Feminine presence is detected, however, in three basic ways: the (unnamed) wives of Noah and “his” sons; the emphasis on the animals who embark the ark as male and female; and the overwhelming presence of
  <i>
   t’hom
  </i>
  , “the deep”—a feminine noun evoking the name of the Babylonians’ salt-water goddess, Tiamat.
  <i>
   T’hom
  </i>
  first appears in
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1:2
  </a>
  as a subdued presence. Riled into action by God,
  <i>
   t’hom
  </i>
  in this Torah portion unleashes its waters and destroys all that lives on land (see at
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g7-1">
   7:1

  ).

  he Flood Story draws upon other ancient Near Eastern traditions about disastrous floods, such as the Babylonian epics Gilgamesh and Atra Hasis (dated as early as the 18th century
  <small>
   B.C.E
  </small>
  .). The parallels between the biblical and Babylonian versions are extensive and striking. They share a basic plot: the divine anger leads to a flood aiming to eradicate humankind. Many details are strikingly similar: one individual is told to build a boat to carry a select few to safety; the instructions for the boat, including the requirement for a window, are often parallel; and a raven and a dove go out to test the conditions in the aftermath. There can be no doubt that Babylonian traditions influenced the biblical version. The most significant differences between the two lie in the cause for the flood: in the BabyIonian myth, the gods unleash the flood because human noise angers them; in Genesis, human violence prompts God to unleash the flood. In the Babylonian versions, the hero receives immortality as a gift from the gods. What the biblical hero receives is a covenant from God that promises the “immortality” of humankind. According to Tikva Frymer-Kensky, the biblical flood is not primarily a punishment but “a means of getting rid of the thoroughly polluted world and starting again with a well-washed one” (“The
  <i>
   Atrahasis
  </i>
  Epic and Its Significance for Our Understanding of
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1–9

  ,”

  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_6.9-9.29">
   Genesis 9:1–7
  </a>
  seek to prevent the kind of bloodshed that pollutes the land.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The description of the flood shows an interweaving of separate versions, illustrating a commitment to more than one voice in telling the story. Scholars of the Torah’s historical development identify two major strands: “J” (also called “Yahwist,” a Judean source) and “P” (Priestly source), each with its own characteristics (see the
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#page_1">
   introduction to Genesis
  </a>

  Already introduced in the previous parashah as the hope of both humankind (

  <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">

  In the Babylonian flood stories, the gods are angry at humankind because people have become a nuisance, disturbing the peace. Genesis, instead, makes unchecked human violence the reason for God’s drastic action of wiping out all living creatures—returning the world to primeval chaos.

  The Flood is more than an overflow of water; it represents a return to primeval chaos, with water breaking through the boundaries created in
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1
  </a>
  to form and protect the earth. The floodgates open from above and below, letting the waters wipe out everything. The details of the story show inconsistencies that expose the seams where two accounts are woven together. The actual flood lasts 40 days (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g7-17">

  God reassesses humankind’s nature and accepts human limitations. The anthropomorphic description of a God who responds and recants at the pleasing smell of sacrifice makes some modern readers uneasy. More striking is the basis of God’s change of heart. The reason for not destroying life again is virtually the same as the reason for the flood: human beings incline to evil from their youth. In other words, God—not humankind—changes as a result of the flood.

  The transgressions that led to the Flood transform God’s expectations. They result in new rules to guide humankind and a promise of a perpetual covenant. God’s blessings and God’s new instructions signal a new beginning. Only the command to procreate unites this commissioning with the first one in
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1:28
  </a>
  .
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  New guidelines aim at channeling impulses and containing them. The values are inscribed in the laws: life is precious, human life especially so. Several notable elements differentiate this renewal from the earlier commissioning of humankind. Eating meat (with some qualifications) is now permitted, perhaps as a concession to human need for aggression (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g9-1">
   9:4
  </a>
  ). Bloodshed is to be controlled. In particular, the sanctity of human life is announced (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g9-1">
   9:6
  </a>
  ). The absence of women in this text contrasts with the earlier blessings in
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1
  </a>
  . In split-screen fashion, an inclusive vision is also present meanwhile in the references to
  <i>
   adam,
  </i>
  the generic human being who is (still) in God’s image (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g9-1">

  Realizing that his son Ham saw him naked, Noah utters a curse. The story aims at asserting the dignity of the father and rewards those who cover the father’s nakedness. Many details remain unexplained, leaving irresolvable problems that later interpreters attempt to excuse. Why is Canaan punished for his father’s indiscretion? The story does not answer such questions. Rather, it functions as an etiology for Canaanite-Israelite tensions that will appear in later biblical accounts. Contemporary scholars hold that, historically speaking, Israel emerged mainly out of, and sought to distinguish itself from, a Canaanite population. The present story may seek to justify such a separation (compare

  Biblical genealogies presume that the head of the household stands for the household as a whole, including its women (and subordinate men)—an assumption shared throughout the Bible and the ancient Near East. Thus biblical genealogies rarely mention mothers, wives, or daughters. (
  <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#exo_6.2-7.7">
   Exodus 6:14–25
  </a>
  is one exception.) In fact, however, the women cemented relationships among patrilineally defined groups via marriage.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Women must have been integral to Israelite kinship, for biblical stories take for granted that men who are related to each other only through a woman treat each other as kin (see

  ; Judges 9:1–3; II Samuel 13:37 in light of 3:3; 21:4–8). Nor is patrilineage always sufficient to identify oneself: Rebekah and Jacob each mention female ancestry (

   Genesis 24:24
  </a>

  <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.1-30">

  ddly, this story of the nations’ dispersion follows the uncontroversial spread of nations described in the previous passage. This interlude, which interrupts the genealogy of Shem, accomplishes a number of things in very few lines: it reiterates the theme of humankind trying to go too far (again), accounts for linguistic diversity, and establishes the ignominious beginning of Babylon, Israel’s eventual oppressor.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Less obviously, the story also expresses a significant theological message about God’s new relationship with humankind. The story’s taut, concise structure depicts divine response as mirroring human action very precisely. In sharp contrast to the indiscriminating response with the Flood, God’s measured retribution demonstrates a system in which the “punishment” fits the “crime” (as noted in
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g9-1">

  In language that closely parallels the human words in v. 3, God dismantles the human project point by point (brick by brick?). God uses the people’s words but with different meanings—most of which cannot be adequately reproduced in English, such as the use of

  (brick), and
  <i>
   n’belah
  </i>

  Until we come to Abraham, this genealogy mentions no wives, whereas it mentions the birth of (unnamed) daughters along with sons (until v. 26). In both respects it resembles the pre-Flood genealogy of

  he family of Abram and Sarai represents a new beginning, and women emerge for the first time in this parashah as named individuals. Although Abram will become the chief protagonist later in Genesis, Sarai (later called Sarah) receives more attention in this introduction. Her condition of barrenness creates the challenge that will propel the rest of this couple’s story.

   GENEALOGY IS
  </small>
  a typical narrative strategy to account for the long passage of time and also to express the relationships among groups. In this parashah, the concluding genealogy leads to Abram and Sarai (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_11.27-32">
   11:27–32
  </a>
  ). It is shocking that this genealogy ends with the information that Sarai is barren, a statement that counters the very notion of genealogy, namely, family connectedness across generations.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The theme of barrenness is emphasized in the story of the ancestors, beginning with Sarah, the first matriarch; and it recurs in the next two generations, with Rebekah (25:21) and then Rachel (29:31). The idea of a barren woman giving birth highlights the importance of the offspring, calling attention to God’s role in the child’s birth—and thus to the significance of the child.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  At the same time, the presence of the barrenness theme in matriarchal narratives signifies the values and concerns of an agrarian people. Most Israelites were self-sufficient farmers, requiring a team of people to work the land; having offspring therefore meant survival. It also meant the opportunity to raise an heir who would intimately know and maintain that parcel of land. Family lands were held as patrimonies and passed down across generations. Not surprisingly, legal precepts in the Torah aimed at helping families retain their property (see
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
   Leviticus 25:23–28
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In light of the great importance of land as inheritance, barrenness was a grave problem. Archeology has produced artifacts, such as small female figurines, that arguably were used, along with prayers, in household rituals women surely performed to deal with infertility. Also, potions and remedies to overcome barrenness are known from the texts of other ancient Near Eastern peoples and later Jewish folklore; and surely they were used by Israelite women (see the mandrake of
  <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.31-30.24">
   Genesis 30:14–16
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In addition, like other ancient peoples, the Israelites solved this problem by allowing for adoption or polygyny (multiple wives). A householder could take a second wife or secondary wife (a servant or a concubine), and the resulting offspring would allow the lineage—reckoned along the male line—to continue and the land to remain in the family. For elite families, especially royalty, having multiple wives was a sign of status; in ordinary families it was a solution to the dire predicament of the barrenness of a man’s initial wife.

  ;
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g7-7">

  </a>
  ) but she is never named. While she is not the only woman (or man) to go unnamed in Hebrew Scriptures, the Rabbis were curious about her identity. Midrash
  <i>
   B’reishit Rabbah
  </i>
  23.3 preserves a dispute about her name, in which one rabbi argues that Noah’s wife was Naamah, the “sister of Tubal-Cain,” a descendant of Adam and Eve’s son Cain, who is listed in the
  <a id="page_54">
  </a>
  genealogies in
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#G4-22">
   Genesis 4:22
  </a>
  . He justifies his view with the explanation that the name derives from the word “pleasant” and that Noah’s wife’s actions were pleasing (
  <i>
   n’imim
  </i>
  ) to God. However, the majority opinion in
  <i>
   B’reishit Rabbah
  </i>
  23.3 rejects the identification of Noah’s wife with the Naamah of 4:22 since “her name indicates that she sang (
  <i>
   man'emet)
  </i>
  to the timbrel in honor of idolatry.”
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   <b>
    Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives came into the ark
   </b>
  </i>
  (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g7-7">
   7:7
  </a>
  ). Noah’s family and the animals were chosen for preservation on the ark in male-female pairs, in order to ensure the continuation of their species after the Flood. However, a midrash in the Talmud (BT
  <i>
   Sanhedrin
  </i>
  108b) teaches that this process of “continuation” did not begin on the ark. Careful attention to the word order shows that the genders were separated at the boarding of the ark. The midrash contrasts this with the wording of
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#G8-16">
   Genesis 8:16
  </a>
  where the instructions for disembarking are given to marriage groupings. That is, Noah was instructed that he should leave first with his wife, and then his sons with their wives. Thus, the authors of this midrash demonstrate that the sexes were segregated on board, at least enough that they did not have sexual contact on the ark. However, when they disembarked, each male, together with the appropriate female, they were to resume normal sexual relations.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   <b>
    Abram’s wife was named Sarai…Haran father of Milcah and of Yiscah
   </b>
  </i>
  (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_11.27-32">
   11:29
  </a>
  ). The text introduces us to Abraham, who at this point is still referred to by his pre-covenantal name, Abram. Similarly, his wife Sarah is also referred to here by her pre-covenantal name, Sarai. However, the Rabbis noticed that the first time Sarai is mentioned, her family is not identified. Yet in the same verse, Milcah—the wife of Abram’s brother Nahor—is identified as the daughter of Haran; in addition and for no obvious reason,
  <i>
   her
  </i>
  sister Yiscah is then mentioned. The following verse (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_11.27-32">
   Genesis 11:30
  </a>
  ) resumes Sarai’s story once again. It is probably the juxtaposition of all of these characters, as well as the rabbinic desire to link Sarai to the larger family, that explains a midrashic tradition that Sarai and Yiscah were in fact the same person. (The idea of marrying a niece would not have seemed unusual in the biblical or rabbinic eras. It is not one of the incestuous relationships forbidden in
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  .) The Talmud explains this conflation of Sarah with Yiscah (BT
  <i>
   M’gillah
  </i>
  14a) linguistically. The Hebrew letters that spell the name Yiscah are similar to the Hebrew verb “to look” (
  <i>
   s-c-h).
  </i>
  Thus, based on midrashic traditions of Sarah’s great beauty, the Rabbis explain that Sarai was called Yiscah because everyone wanted to
  <i>
   look
  </i>
  at her. A second explanation offered is that Sarai was called Yiscah because she was a prophet and could
  <i>
   look
  </i>
  into the future.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   <b>
    And Sarah was barren; she had no offspring
   </b>
  </i>
  (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_11.27-32">
   11:30
  </a>
  ). The Talmud (BT
  <i>
   Y’vamot
  </i>
  64b) understands this double description of Sarah’s infertility to have two meanings. The first phrase,
  <i>
   was barren,
  </i>
  means Sarah did not have children; and the second phrase,
  <i>
   she had no offspring,
  </i>
  indicates she was missing the vital internal organs necessary for conception and pregnancy. Thus, the later birth of Isaac was doubly miraculous.

   GENESIS BEGINS
  </small>
  with God’s creation of the world by word alone:
  <i>
   God said, “Let there be light!”
  </i>
  (
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   1:3
  </a>
  ). At the end of
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1
  </a>
  ,
  <i>
   God surveyed all that [God] had made, and look—it was very good!
  </i>
  With language God created the world, separated the waters above from the waters below, named, judged, and expressed great satisfaction with the results. But by the end of
  <i>
   parashat B’reishit,
  </i>
  we read that
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
   יהוה
  </span>
  <i>
   saw how great was the wickedness of human beings.…So
  </i>
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
   יהוה
  </span>
  <i>
   thought: “I will wipe the humans whom I created from off the face of the earth"
  </i>
  (
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#g6-6">
   6:5–7
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In
  <i>
   parasht Noach,
  </i>
  what sin had the people committed to warrant the Flood? The fact that so many different answers have been offered suggests that there is no clear answer. Some interpreters say that the wrongdoing was miscegenation: the interbreeding between the sons of God and the daughters of mankind (
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_6.1-4">
   6:1–4
  </a>
  ). Others in traditional sources postulate that it was the sin of refusing to have children—indeed, even Noah waited until he was 500 years old to have his first child.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  For all the various theories about the precise nature of the sin, it is clear that the Flood’s essential purpose was to cleanse Creation of the flaw that led to its corruption. And yet, from the time of the Ark’s landing on dry land, God demonstrates an awareness that some essential flaw persists. God says:
  <i>
   Never again will I bring doom upon the world on account of what people do, though the human mind inclines to evil from youth onward
  </i>
  (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g8-21">
   8:21
  </a>
  ). Why does the human mind incline to evil? What is the flaw in the human mind? While the questions are not explicitly answered, we can nevertheless find answers in our tradition.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Many commentators have criticized Noah for not challenging God about the planned destruction, as Abraham later does when God reveals the plan to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah (18:17–33). Readers over the ages have been puzzled by Noah’s silence. But his silence is precisely the point. Nearly the entire portion of
  <i>
   Noach
  </i>
  is filled with God’s speech and Noah’s actions—but not words. From his building the ark through the entire Flood, Noah utters not a single word. When Noah finally speaks after being
  <i>
   awakened from his wine
  </i>
  (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g9-24">
   9:24
  </a>
  ), his words disclose the problem: he
  <i>
   understood what his youngest son had done to him, so he said “Damned be Canaan! To his brothers he shall be the basest of slaves!"
  </i>
  (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g9-24">
   9:24–25
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  So Noah’s first words neither praise God, nor express gratitude, nor ask for help, nor proclaim justice. Instead, he uses language to curse and to set up the differentiated love that will plague all the offspring of Genesis—from Ishmael and Isaac to Esau and Jacob, and to Joseph and his brothers. By “differentiated love” I mean love that is given to one person and withheld from another.
 </div>
 <div class="image">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="image0">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Noah’s first words show what might be an essential flaw in creation, leading to destruction in this parashah. As we read in Proverbs 18:21,
  <i>
   death and life are in the power of the tongue.
  </i>
  We have already seen the creative power of language in
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1
  </a>
  . Now it becomes clear that one sin causing the Flood was the abuse of language. In a way, we have always known that, as the Confession for the Day of Atonement lists many forms of language: idle talk, offensive speech, foolish talk, slander, passing judgment, plotting, talebearing, and swearing falsely. Each of these offenses involves some abuse of language.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In
  <i>
   parashat Noach,
  </i>
  the inherent flaw is made clear. Noah’s words form a curse; moreover, even when he comes to bless (9:27), he does so comparatively, blessing
  <a id="page_56">
  </a>
  one son at the expense of another son’s son, relegating his grandson Canaan to the role of slave. But love should not be comparative, quantifiable, or conditional.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  God acknowledges the power of human language in the very next story, the episode of the Tower of Babel (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_11.1-9">
   Genesis 11
  </a>
  ). This time God, in order to restrain the people who are reaching out to heaven, confuses the language. God is thus undermining their capacity to use language in a destructive fashion (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_11.1-9">
   11:1–6
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  From Noah’s words and the people’s words when they attempt to build their tower, we learn that the language that survives the devastation of the Flood is that of differentiated love, competition, hatred, cursing, and revenge across generations. God’s action at Babel is an attempt to heal the flaw of the sin at Babel by multiplying languages: perhaps somewhere among the new tongues would emerge a vision of reality that transcends the destructive, condemning words carried forward in the ark.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Our own experience verifies the lesson of the sin of the Flood. We know how language can kill. We have seen the medical charts on which a doctor has scribbled “untreatable,” thereby sealing a patient’s fate. We have labeled a plant in our garden a “weed,” thus sealing its fate.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Silence, then, might be a virtue. During the long days of the Flood and its aftermath, Noah did well, being silent. His silence reminds us of the better part of Job’s comforters who initially
  <i>
   sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights. None spoke a word to him for they saw how very great was his suffering
  </i>
  (Job 2:13). Once they began to speak, though, their words brought only discomfort, and finally God rebuked them:
  <i>
   for you have not spoken the truth about Me as did My servant Job
  </i>
  (42:7).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  What lessons may we draw from this juxtaposition of silence and language? Is human speech invariably destructive? Where can we find the language that blesses, heals, and even creates? Again, the model is within this parashah, when God responds.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  God restricts divine power, saying:
  <i>
   Never again will I bring doom upon the world on account of what people do
  </i>
  (
  <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_6.9-9.29">
   Genesis 8:21
  </a>
  ); God restores blessings:
  <i>
   God then blessed Noah and his sons saying to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth”
  </i>
  (9:1); and God enters into covenant with all living creatures:
  <i>
   I am going to establish My covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living being in your care
  </i>
  (9:9–10).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  God’s words and actions in the aftermath of destruction show us how we can use language to repair relationships, instruct others, forgive, and bless.
