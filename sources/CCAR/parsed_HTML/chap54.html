<div class="chap1"><small>DEUTERONOMY 33:1–34:12
</small><i>Moses’ Last Words: A Blessing for Israel
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>’ZOT</small> H<small>AB’RACHAH</small> (“this is the blessing”) presents Moses’ poetic blessing of the Israelites (33:1–29), which is followed by a brief record of Moses’ death and a tribute to his unparalleled prophetic stature (34:1–12). As we come to the end of Moses’ life, it seems fitting to reflect back on the epic story of Israel’s unrivaled leader.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses’ story begins in the book of Exodus (2:1–22), where we read that a Levite woman and a Levite man (later identified as Jochebed and Amram) give birth to a child whose life is imperiled by the Pharaoh’s decree to kill all Israelite baby boys. Although Moses’ mother initially defies the king and hides her son, after three months she is forced to abandon him, so she places him in a basket floating down the Nile. His sister, Miriam, then watches as Pharaoh’s own daughter rescues and adopts the Hebrew child. At Miriam’s suggestion, the princess hands Moses over to his mother, Jochebed, who nurses him for several years. Thus, it takes the courage, ingenuity, and collaboration of these three women to ensure the survival of Israel’s future liberator and leader.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Although raised as Egyptian royalty, Moses eventually identifies with the plight of his enslaved kin. But when defending a beaten Israelite leads to manslaughter, Moses flees to Midian. There, he marries Zipporah, the daughter of the Midianite priest Yitro, and fathers two sons. Then, while shepherding his father-in-law’s flocks on Mount Horeb (also known as Mount Sinai), he glimpses the Divine amidst a bush that burns yet remains unconsumed. Reluctantly, he accepts God’s call to return to Egypt and rescue his people (Exodus 3–4). With the aid of his brother Aaron, Moses orchestrates God’s signs and wonders and eventually persuades Pharaoh to let Israel go (Exodus 5–15).
</div><div class="tab-enin">The exodus from Egypt leads to a second encounter with God atop the same mountain, where God communicates the precepts by which Israel is to live (Exodus 19–20). The rest of the Torah describes how Moses oversees the construction of the Tabernacle and the ordination of the priesthood and then leads the people on a forty-year trek through the wilderness. Once they reach the plains of Moab, Moses reaffirms the covenant and instructs the people how to live in order to thrive in the Promised Land. For Israel, the wilderness journey will culminate in the entry into the land of Canaan, as recounted in the book of Joshua. For Moses, as we read in this parashah, the journey will end atop another mountain, Mount Nebo, as he surveys the land and dies at God’s command.

</div><div class="tab-enin"><i>Parashat V’zot Hab’rachah</i> is unique in that it is not designated as a weekly Torah portion. Instead, it is read on Simchat Torah, the holiday that marks the conclusion of the annual Torah reading cycle and the commencement of a new lectionary cycle of weekly Torah readings.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The focus of this parashah is on Moses and the tribes named for Jacob’s sons; women are explicitly mentioned only once, in the reference to a mother in 33:9. However, 33:4 states, “Moses charged us with the Teaching [<i>torah</i>] as the heritage of the congregation of Jacob.” Who is “us”? Prior passages in Deuteronomy specify that women were included in the covenant (29:10) and were taught the <i>torah</i> (31:12).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Finally, 34:8 mentions that “the Israelites bewailed Moses” for thirty days. Evidence shows that women were trained as singers of laments and likely would have played a main role in mourning Israel’s most cherished leader.

</div><div class="tab-en">Moses delivers his final words to the entire assembly of Israel—men, women, and children, everyone from the leaders of the tribes to those who chop wood and draw water (29:9–10)—just before the “Source of the breath of all flesh” (Numbers 27:16) takes his life. Like Jacob, who blessed his sons while he lay on his deathbed (Genesis 49), Moses blesses the tribes of Israel. But, whereas Jacob’s words are often disparaging, Moses’ message is decidedly positive: he looks ahead to a time when the tribes will enjoy prosperity and security. Here, the criticism voiced in Deuteronomy 32 gives way to assurances and praise.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Many scholars maintain that the Blessing of Moses, like the Song of Moses that precedes it (in <i>parashat Haazinu),</i> was originally a separate composition that later was inserted into the concluding section of the book. A number of words and even complete verses continue to baffle scholars, and opinions vary about the likely dating of this text. Some assert that the verses before and after the tribal blessings (vv. 2–5 and 26–29) at one time constituted a separate hymn or might have been written as a framework for the preexisting blessings. Although vv. 2–29 are not laid out in poetic form in Torah scrolls, they exhibit the typical features of biblical poetry (see the introduction to 32:1–43).
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.1">PROSE INTRODUCTION (33:1)
</div><div class="tab-enin">This verse labels the poetic composition that follows as a “blessing.” While it has the overall appearance of a father’s last words to his offspring (as in Genesis 27:28–29, 39–40; 49:2–27), parts of the text display affinities to other genres, such as the hymn known as the Song of Deborah (Judges 5), and Balaam’s blessings of Israel (Numbers 23–24).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>God’s envoy.</b></i> Heb. <i>ish ha-elohim,</i> often translated as “man of God.” Although this is the only time that this phrase appears in the Torah, it occurs frequently in the rest of the Bible to designate Moses, certain other prophets, and King David. (For instance, see how the widow uses the expression to refer to Elijah in I Kings 17:18, 24 and the Shunammite woman as a label for Elisha in II Kings 4:9, 16). The present translation takes <i>ish</i> as referring here to the role of representing another party on a mission (as in, for example, Genesis 24:21; Leviticus 16:21; Numbers 13:2; 22:9; Deuteronomy 1:22); in that sense, the expression <i>ish ha-elohim</i> neatly encapsulates Moses’ forty-year career as God’s agent, which began at the Burning Bush (Exodus 3:10; see also at v. 16, below). (See David Stein, “What Does It Mean to Be a ‘Man’?” 2006–7, §§ 11. B.1; 111. B. 8.)
</div><b>bade…farewell.</b> Literally, “blessed.” See Genesis 27:10.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:2"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.2-5">PROLOGUE: GOD AS WARRIOR AND KING (33:2–5)<br></br>This section (particularly v. 3) has baffled interpreters, ancient and modem, with its many difficulties. Nevertheless, the general message is that God came from the south to aid Israel (as in Judges 5:4; Habakkuk 3:3) and subsequently was considered Israel’s king.
</div><b>Sinai.</b> This is the only time that this word appears in Deuteronomy; throughout the book, Horeb designates this mountain (see at Exodus 18:5).<br></br><i><b>Lightning flashing at them.</b></i> Although the Hebrew here remains uncertain, the phrase seems to fit with the verse’s underlying image of God as a (male) warrior who comes to Israel’s salvation. (For more on the warrior metaphor, see at Exodus 14:14; 15:3; Deuteronomy 32:23; see also <i>Haazinu,</i> Another View.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:4"><b>Moses charged us.</b> Commentators have puzzled over the third-person reference to Moses in a text that he recites, as well as the relationship between this verse and its surrounding context. Some explain that God must have been the original subject; others view this as an acclamation of the people. Deuteronomy 31:12 emphasizes that the Levites are to teach the <i>torah</i> to all Israel—women and men, children and strangers.<br></br><i><b>Teaching.</b></i> Heb. <i>torah;</i> see at 31:9.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:5"><b>[God] became King.</b> Given the prominence of the image of God as king in Jewish liturgy, where most blessings contain the phrase <i>melech haolam</i> (“King of the universe”), it is surprising that the metaphor appears only three times in the Torah: here, Exodus 15:18, and Numbers 23:21. All three are poetic passages, which is where the king metaphor nearly always appears. It is found far more frequently elsewhere in the Bible (as in Isaiah 33:22; Psalm 24:7–10) and in ancient Near Eastern texts, where the notion of the divine king connotes not only power and authority, but also the execution of justice, compassion for the needy, and the maintenance of social order and prosperity (see Psalm 72).<br></br>Carol Meyers observes that the frequency and variety of andromorphic (male-shaped) images of God, such as divine king and warrior, “can produce the impression of God as exclusively male—the so-called patriarchal God of the Hebrew Bible.” She adds that since Hebrew is a gendered language and the words for God generally are masculine, this further contributes to the sense of a male deity (<i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 526). Yet as she and other scholars explain, one must look more closely in order to get an accurate picture. The male images actually convey things about God other than gender (see at 10:17). Apart from such imagery and from the linguistic necessity of using masculine wording, the Torah is conspicuously silent about God’s gender, especially compared to ancient Near Eastern descriptions of other deities (see Tikva Frymer-Kensky, <i>In the Wake of the Goddesses,</i> 1992, pp. 83–99, 187–189). Meanwhile, female divine imagery, although less frequent, can in fact be found in the Bible (see at Exodus 15:22–17:16; 15:26; Numbers 11:12; Deuteronomy 32:13, 18). Biblical writers incorporated a range of female, male, and non-gendered metaphors for God as they attempted to articulate their understanding of who God is and how God operates in the world.<br></br><b><i>Jeshurun.</i></b> See at v. 26.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:6"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.6-25">BLESSING OF THE TRIBES (33:6–25)<br></br>Although Moses and his wife Zipporah have two sons, Gershom (Exodus 2:22; 18:3) and Eliezer (Exodus 18:4), as he approaches his death, Moses blesses not his biological heirs but the tribes, one by one. Usually, the tribes are listed in the birth order of their eponymous ancestors, grouped according to their mothers (see at Genesis 46:8–27 and at 49:1–27). Here, however, Moses addresses the tribes in geographical order, starting with Reuben, in whose territory the Israelites stand, and then moving across the River Jordan from Judah in the south to Asher in the north. Nevertheless, a maternal arrangement can be discerned, a likely reflection of existing geopolitical patterns: three of Leah’s first four sons (Simeon is not mentioned; see at v. 7 below), followed by Rachel’s two sons, then Leah’s fifth and sixth sons, and then the four sons of the handmaids, Zilpah and Bilhah.
</div> The blessing for Reuben constitutes a plea that the tribe not perish. Situated in the Transjordan (see Numbers 32), this tribe was cut off geographically from most of the other tribes by the Jordan river and likely would have been vulnerable to attacks by neighbors to the east and south.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:7"> The blessing for Judah calls upon God to rescue Judah from an unidentified enemy. The depiction of Judah’s being in a precarious situation contrasts sharply with the characterization of Judah in Genesis 49:8–12. There, he is compared to a ferocious lion and described as being in a position of power and wealth. Some scholars posit that this verse originally may have contained a blessing for Simeon.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="33:8–11" ref="33:8"> The blessing for Levi emphasizes the tribe’s loyalty to God. As a reward, they have merited the privilege of serving as priests, teaching God’s precepts, and officiating at the sacrificial altar.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:8"><b>Thummim and Urim.</b> These divinatory devices (usually listed in the reverse order) apparently consisted of some sort of lots kept in a pouch attached to the priest’s breastplate (see at Exodus 28:30).<br></br><b><i>Massah…Meribah.</i></b> The mention of these two place names seems to refer to the incident in Exodus 17:1–7, but there the thirsty Israelites test God and the Levites play no role in the episode. However, the Torah records two other incidents in which the Levites display their faithfulness to God at the expense of their fellow Israelites. In Exodus 32:26–29, following the construction of the Golden Calf, the Levites rally to Moses’ call and kill 3,000 of their “kin.” In Numbers 25, the priest (hence also Levite) Phinehas zealously stabs the Simeonite chieftain and the Midianite woman who are engaging in illicit activities at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:9"><b>father and mother.</b> This verse refers to an episode in which the Levites disregarded family ties in executing God’s laws, possibly meaning the Golden Calf incident (Exodus 32:26–29). By implication, an Israelite man normally does—or at least should—consider the opinions of both his father and his mother. A number of biblical passage mention the mother alongside the father, most famously the command to honor one’s father and mother (for example, see at Exodus 20:12 and at Leviticus 19:3, where the order is “mother and father”). In particular, Deuteronomy 13:7 warns against being lured into idolatrous practices by female or male relatives.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:10"><b>They shall offer You incense…And whole offerings.</b> While the priest officiates over the sacrificial system, those who bring the offerings—women and men alike—are to participate to some extent in the sacrificial ritual. (For details, see the Introduction to parashat Vayikra.)</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:12"> The blessing for Benjamin expresses a hope for security for this relatively small tribe. The last line is ambiguous; alternatively, it could mean that Benjamin is carried on God’s shoulders (see 1:31), or that God dwells amid Benjamin’s “slopes.”</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="33:13–17" ref="33:13"> Joseph receives the longest blessing, which covers the two tribes named after his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. The blessing emphasizes the fertility of their territory and their prominence.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:12"><b>the bounty.</b> Heb. <i>meged.</i> This key word repeats five times in vv. 13–16 as Moses elaborates on the fecundity of the land. In her book <i>In the Wake of the Goddesses</i> (1992), Tikva Frymer-Kensky argues that “the biblical understanding of fertility is radically different from that of ancient Near Eastern polytheism” (p. 92). She explains that in ancient Near Eastern polytheism “agricultural fertility is thought to result from the collective activity of male and female deities acting in concert (or consort)” (p. 89); yet in the Bible, God alone is responsible for the fertility of the land. Frymer-Kensky claims that a remarkable aspect of the creation account in Genesis 1 is that God makes the earth fertile, with seed-bearing plants able to reproduce if given the proper conditions. She writes: “To the Bible, God’s fertility-bringing power lies in God’s power over the rain. The natural state of the earth is fertile: it needs only the rain to activate this natural potential” (pp. 92–93).<br></br><i><b>the deep.</b></i> Heb. <i>t’hom,</i> a noun that hints at a mythological link between the subterranean waters and the Mesopotamian goddess Tiamat (see at Genesis 1:2 and 7:11).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:16"><b>Presence in the Bush.</b> Or “the One who Dwells in the Bush” <i>(shochni s’neh);</i> the later concept of God’s Presence as the <i>Shechinah</i> comes from the same root as <i>shochni</i> (see <i>T’rumah,</i> Post-biblical Interpretations). This unique epithet alludes to Moses’ first encounter with God at the Burning Bush (Exodus 3:1–6).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:17"><b>firstling.</b> Although Joseph was Jacob’s eleventh son, not his first, he was Rachel’s long-awaited first-born. According to I Chronicles 5:1–2, Reuben lost his status as first-born because he “defiled his father’s bed” by sleeping with his father’s concubine, Bilhah (Genesis 35:22); as a result, Joseph received the birthright, even though Judah became the most prominent.<br></br><b><i>bull…wild-ox.</i></b> These animals were common symbols of virility in the Bible and ancient Near Eastern texts.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="33:18–19" ref="33:18"> This blessing speaks to the future fortune of both Zebulun and Issachar. It implies that the two tribes occupied the area from the Sea of Chinnereth (also called Lake Kinneret, or Sea of Galilee) as far as the Mediterranean, which allowed them to prosper due to their maritime ventures.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:19"><b>they draw from the riches of the sea.</b> Literally, “they suckle,” from the same root (<i>y-n-k</i>) used in the description of God nursing Israel with honey and oil (see at 32:13).<br></br><b><i>riches of the sea…hoards of the sand.</i></b> These phrases could refer to various goods, not only fish and shells, but also glass and murex snails—the treasured source of purple dye. (For more on the manufacture of dyed cloths and women’s roles in these activities, see at Exodus 35:4 and <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="33:20–21" ref="33:20"> The blessing of Gad alludes to this tribe’s military might and their request to settle in the choice pastureland east of the Jordan (Numbers 32).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:22"> The blessing of Dan uses a metaphor of a lion to depict their power and prowess (see also v. 20 and Genesis 49:9, where the image applies to Judah).<br></br><i><b>leaps forth.</b></i> Heb. <i>y’zanek,</i> from the rare root <i>z-n-k.</i> Jeffrey Tigay notes that some scholars suggest emending this verb to <i>yonek</i> (<i>y-n-k</i>), “to suckle,” as in v. 19 (see also at 32:13). This would mean “that Dan is nourished effortlessly by the cattle and products of the fertile Bashan” (<i>Deuteronomy</i>, 1996, p. 411).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:23"> The benevolent blessing of Naphtali reflects the tribe’s location in the lush upper Galilee.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="33:24–25" ref="33:24"> The blessing for Asher revolves around the themes of agricultural fertility (see at v. 13) and security. The blessing seems fitting for the tribe’s namesake, whom Leah named to capture her joy at giving birth to another son, through her handmaid Zilpah (Genesis 30:13).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:24"><b>May he dip his foot in oil.</b> This expression seems to reflect the abundance of olive trees in Asher’s territory, in the highlands of the Galilee.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:26"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.26-29">EPILOGUE: GOD AS REFUGE AND WARRIOR (33:26–29)<br></br>In this concluding section, Moses turns his attention from the individual tribes to the people as a whole. As he extols God as Israel’s source of security and prosperity, he makes it clear that the key blessings he hopes for the tribes—fertility of the land, military success, and tranquility—depend on God’s unparalleled beneficence and power. These are Moses’ last words in the Torah.
</div><b>Jeshurun.</b> This fairly uncommon name for Israel also appeared in v. 5, thus forming a frame around the tribal blessings.<br></br><i><b>there is none like God.</b></i> A hallmark of Deuteronomy is its insistence on God’s unrivaled divinity. Certain passages express a clearly monotheistic perspective (see at 4:35); others herald God’s uniqueness while allowing for the existence of other, minor deities—a notion referred to as monolatry (see at 4:19–20; 32:8, 43).<br></br><i><b>Riding through the heavens.</b></i> In the Bible, God frequently appears as a (male) warrior riding through the skies in order to rescue Israel from her enemies. Various passages depict God descending to earth on a chariot (such as Habakkuk 3:8), clouds (such as Psalm 104:3), or cherub (such as Psalm 18:11). The image is also found in other ancient Near Eastern texts, particularly Ugaritic poems describing the storm god Baal.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:27"><b>arms everlasting.</b> This expression of God’s support for Israel seems to portray God embracing or carrying Israel. Similarly, Deuteronomy 1:31 compares God’s treatment of Israel in the wilderness to a parent carrying a child. Isaiah 40:11 promises that when God redeems the Babylonian exiles, God will be like a shepherd who gently gathers and carries the flock in his or her arms (for examples of female shepherds, see Genesis 29:9; Exodus 2:16). Isaiah 46:3–4 expresses a similar message using a maternal metaphor. God addresses the exiles—“who have been carried since birth, / Supported since leaving the womb”—and pledges to them: “Till you grow old, I will be the same; / When you turn gray, it is I who will carry; / I was the Maker, and I will be the Bearer; / And I will carry and rescue [you].”<br></br><i><b>drove out the enemy.</b></i> This looks ahead to the defeat of the Canaanites when Israel enters the Promised Land (see at 7:24).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:28"><b>Under heavens dripping dew.</b> On the importance of rain or other forms of moisture for the fertility of the land, see at v. 13.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:29"><b>Shield…Sword.</b> See at v. 2.<br></br><i><b>you shall tread on their backs.</b></i> In the Bible and ancient Near Eastern documents, placing one’s foot on the enemy’s back or neck symbolizes victory (see Joshua 10:24).<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="34:1"><div class="head2a"><i>The Death of Moses</i> (34:1–12)
</div><div class="tab-en">The Torah preserves a number of narrative passages that record the deaths of select individuals: Sarah (Genesis 23:1–2), Abraham (Genesis 25:7–10), Ishmael (Genesis 25:17), Rebekah’s nurse Deborah (Genesis 35:8), Rachel (Genesis 35:18–20), Isaac (Genesis 35:28–29), Jacob (Genesis 49:29–33), Joseph (Genesis 50:22–26), Miriam (Numbers 20:1), Aaron (Numbers 20:24–29), and Moses. These death reports show certain common elements, not all of which are mentioned for every character. Typical features include the person’s age at the time of death, the location where the person died, the person’s physical condition, a pronouncement of the death, typically with formulaic, euphemistic language (for example, “Isaac then breathed his last and died; he was gathered to his people old and full of years,” Genesis 35:29), details about the burial, and a comment about the mourning that follows the death. Of all these reports, only Moses’ contains every one of these elements. The length of this unit and the way that it characterizes Moses testify to the unparalleled stature of the leader who shepherded the Israelites from the house of bondage to the gateway to the Promised Land.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.1-4">SURVEY OF THE PROMISED LAND (34:1–4)
</div><div class="tab-enin">In 3:25, Moses recounted how he pleaded with God to reconsider his sentence: “Let me, I pray, cross over and see the good land on the other side of the Jordan.” Although God rejected the first part of Moses’ entreaty, God conceded to the second part and agreed to let Moses view the land someday from a mountaintop in Moab (3:27). Finally, that day has arrived.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Having spoken his last words, Moses now performs his two last acts: ascending Mount Nebo, and surveying the land. He first gazes northward along the eastern side of the Jordan and then north to south on the western side, all the way from Dan to the Negeb. It would not be humanly possible to see such a vast expanse of land from Moses’ vantage point, but such a claim seems only fitting given the extraordinary nature of Moses’ death and burial.
</div><b>Moses went up.</b> Two earlier verses record God’s command to Moses to ascend a mountain to view the land (Numbers 27:12; Deuteronomy 32:49). In both cases, God reminds Moses that his inability to enter the land comes as a consequence of the incident at the waters of Meribath-kadesh when Moses “disobeyed” and “broke faith with” God (Numbers 27:14; Deuteronomy 32:51; contrast the explanation given in 1:37). Here, as is fitting for the laudatory nature of Moses’ death report, neither God nor the narrator mentions anything about Moses’ death atop Mount Nebo being a punishment.<br></br><b><i>Mount Nebo, to the summit of Pisgah.</i></b> This verse seems to combine two traditions about Moses’ death: one associated with Pisgah (3:27) and the other with Mount Nebo (32:49).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="34:4"><b>“see it with your own eyes.”</b> Deuteronomy repeatedly uses this phrase to emphasize the importance of knowledge gained from firsthand experience (for instance, see 4:3, 9, 34).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="34:7"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.5-7">MOSES’ DEATH (34:5–7)<br></br>The report of Moses’ death emphasizes that he did not die of natural causes, but at God’s behest.
</div><b>hundred and twenty years old.</b> Genesis 6:3 appears to establish 120 years as the ideal human lifespan, although thereafter some biblical figures live longer; Sarah, for example, dies at age 127 (Genesis 23:1). This typological number can be accounted for as being three times forty (a key number in the Bible, as in the length of time of the wilderness journey) or two times sixty (important in the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system). As W. Gunther Plaut points out, 120 is the multiple of the first five whole numbers (1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5) <i>(The Torah: A Modern Commentary,</i> revised edition, 2005, p. 1387).<br></br><i><b>his vigor unabated.</b></i> Literally, “his moisture had not departed [or: dried up].” Earlier, Moses told the people that he “can no longer be active” (31:2). Jeffrey Tigay therefore argues that this clause should be understood instead as meaning “he had not become wrinkled” (<i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, p. 338). (Compare Sarah’s description of herself as “withered” in Genesis 18:12.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.8-9" ref="34:8">MOURNING FOR MOSES, WHO IS SUCCEEDED BY JOSHUA (34:8–9)<br></br>As they did for Aaron (Numbers 20:29), the people mourn Moses for thirty days. Various sources of evidence indicate that throughout the ancient world, women typically were associated with mourning rituals, composing and performing laments in times of collective and personal grief (see <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Contemporary Reflection). This section also confirms the successful transition of leadership to Joshua. Although he is a qualified successor, the subsequent section stresses that no one can rival Moses.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.10-12">TRIBUTE TO MOSES’ UNRIVALED STATUS (34:10–12)<br></br>These concluding verses function as a eulogy, acclaiming Moses’ incomparable stature as the sole prophet who merited unmediated contact with the Divine. (On women prophets, see Another View.) Following the reference to the covenant with the ancestors in v. 4, the text now highlights another pivotal biblical event: the wondrous acts that Moses performed on God’s behalf, resulting in Israel’s deliverance from Egypt. Just as the Exodus forms the foundation of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel—as reflected in the first verse of the Decalogue (Exodus 20:2; Deuteronomy 5:6)—so it is appropriate that the book of Deuteronomy, and hence the entire Torah, ends with the recollection of this event. As befits someone who assiduously sought to have Israel recognize and faithfully worship its God, the last words about Moses’ life reiterate his deep bond with, and loyal service to, the Divine. For Israel to thrive in the Promised Land, and beyond, they will need both God’s “mighty hand” (34:12, translated here as “great might”) and God’s comforting embrace, the support of God’s “arms everlasting” (33:27).<br></br><i></i><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg_296.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="right1"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="chap" id="ano54-1"><div class="tab-en"> DEUTERONOMY 34:10 claims that no other prophet ever matched Moses, whom God had “singled out, face to face.” Albeit unique, Moses is only one of the many prophets who, as God’s spokespersons, guided Israel. In the Bible, Miriam is the very first person to receive the title “prophet” (Exodus 15:20; Genesis 20:7 refers to Abraham’s prophetic gifts, but he is not called “Abraham the prophet”). Along with several passages that mention unnamed female prophets (Isaiah 8:3; Ezekiel 13:17; Joel 3:1), the Bible names three other women prophets: Deborah, Huldah, and Noadiah.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Nothing is known about Noadiah (5th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) apart from Nehemiah’s claim that she opposed him (Nehemiah 6:14); she must have been important enough to disturb Nehemiah, but it is her predecessors Deborah and Huldah who are praised as prominent and influential. Deborah leads the Israelites to victory and is the only chieftain in that period of Israelite history who is also a prophet (Judges 4:4). The poem attributed to Deborah refers to her as a “mother in Israel” (Judges 5:7), a title that probably designates her position as the people’s protector rather than a biological maternity.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Huldah is perhaps Israel’s most successful prophet. Whereas the messages of other prophets in the Bible often fall on deaf ears during their lifetime, Huldah’s authority goes unquestioned and her words are heeded instantly. According to II Kings 22 and II Chronicles 34, a royal delegation in 622 <small>B.C.E.</small> consults Huldah about the “book of the <i>torah”</i> that was found at the Temple. When she authenticates it as God’s teachings, the king immediately—and unquestioningly—implements the book’s laws. Huldah is identified as a married woman, whose husband is the keeper of the king’s wardrobe, while she herself holds “office” in a public area known as the Mishneh. Although the later Rabbis express unease about the prominence of Huldah, the Bible presents her authority as a matter of fact. According to many modern scholars, the “book of the <i>torah</i>” that Huldah authenticates is Deuteronomy, or at least portions of it. If so, we owe the binding authority that Deuteronomy holds to none other than Huldah, whose own words confirmed and thus made possible the preservation and transmission of these teachings to us.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano54-2"><div class="tab-en"> <i><b>May Reuben live and not die</b></i> (33:6). In his farewell blessing to the tribes of Israel, Moses first mentions the tribe of Reuben, descended from Jacob’s eldest son. His benediction for Reuben is expressed in biblical poetic parallelism. To the modern reader this may seem redundant, since it expresses the same idea twice, albeit in different words. For the Rabbis, however, this apparent repetition was an opportunity for interpretation. They noticed that while the first half of the verse expresses the hope that Reuben would live, the second half states that he should not die. Both of these outcomes are positive for Reuben, but the former is phrased in upbeat language, whereas the latter uses negative terminology. Midrash <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 347 finds different meanings in these linguistic nuances. Thus, the first phrase is said to refer to Reuben’s reward for convincing his brothers not to treat Joseph as harshly as they would have liked (Genesis 37:22). The second half of the verse points to a death penalty decreed for Reuben that has been reversed (“not die”), referring to the punishment that Reuben deserved for having sexual relations with Bilhah, his father’s concubine and the mother of some of his brothers (Genesis 35:22). However, a prominent rabbinic tradition teaches that Reuben atoned for this sin and the decree of death was lifted. This midrash from <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> appears to link these two biblical incidents and implies that Reuben’s good actions in one situation helped to atone for his bad actions in the other.

</div><div class="tab-enin"><b><i>So Moses the servant of</i> יהוה’ <i>died there</i></b> (34:5). A medieval <i>piyut</i> (liturgical poem) begins with the words <i>Azlat Yocheved</i> (“Jochebed went out”), referring to Moses’ mother (Exodus 6:20). This <i>piyut</i> is part of the Italian prayer tradition for the holiday of Simchat Torah, when the final Torah portion, including the account of the death of Moses, is read. (While there are no known midrashic parallels for the symbolic ideas in this <i>piyut,</i> it shares common motifs with rabbinic traditions, including a narrative about Moses’ death found in <i>Avot D’Rabbi Natan</i> A 12, in which the angel of death, Samael, is the protagonist, rather than Jochebed.) In the <i>piyut,</i> Jochebed heart-rendingly searches for her son. She has heard of his death but refuses to accept that Moses has actually died. Understandably, a mother would not to want to learn that her son had preceded her in death. However, Jochebed’s refusal to believe in Moses’ demise is complicated by the fact that only God knows the circumstances of his death and his burial place. This <i>piyut</i> describes Jochebed traversing the world, including Egypt and various other pivotal places in Moses’ life, searching for him. In her travels, she asks inanimate objects to tell her the whereabouts of her son. Her quest, of course, is unsuccessful, because he is, in fact already dead and buried.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The theme of the poem <i>“Azlat Yocheved”</i> is based on the rabbinic premise that Jochebed outlived her son Moses, who was 120 years old at his death (34:7). Jochebed’s long life is discussed in a rabbinic midrash in <i>Seder Olam</i> 9, where she is described as surviving all of her children and entering the land of Israel at the age of 250.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><b><i>[God] buried him in the valley in the land of Moab</i></b> (34:6). A midrashic tradition physically connects the burial place of Moses, who was interred alone, to the graves of Abraham and Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah (Genesis 25:10). According to <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 357, the two sites were linked by an underground tunnel.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses’ grave is unknown to human beings but it is known to God. In fact, according to 34:6, Moses was buried by God. BT <i>Sotah</i> 14a explains that the Torah is framed by two divine demonstrations of loving-kindness. The charitable act in the beginning was “clothing the naked.” This was fulfilled when God “made outfits out of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them” (Genesis 3:21). The loving-kindness at the end of the Torah was “burying the dead,” God’s final act of caring for Moses. According to rabbinic sources (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 127a), preparing the dead for burial is one of the ten ethical obligations for which there is no measure and whose reward is without measure.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano54-3"><div class="tab-en"> M<small>OSES’ FINAL BLESSING</small> to the tribes of Israel forms the coda for the five books of the Torah traditionally attributed to Moses. Often in Deuteronomy, Moses has admonished the people of Israel, sometimes threatening or even bullying them. Throughout the book, however, he also has offered the people blessings and a vision of God’s love and potential rewards. Now, at the very end, Moses fills the people with hope and promise as he speaks to their best selves. As the greatest of teachers, Moses puts into words what they instinctively know they long for but cannot quite articulate.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses and Israel began together as an erstwhile prince leading a band of slaves to freedom. Now, the people Israel are not only free, but also they are about to be responsible for their own lives in their own land. As they become a sovereign people, Moses (as it were) stitches them together, tribe after tribe, weaving a dramatic finale: “Thus Israel dwells in safety, / Untroubled is Jacob’s abode” (33:28). This stunning statement confirms the Israelites’ greatest hope, as well as ours today, envisioning a time even beyond the battles that lie ahead, when they finally will live in security and safety.
</div><div class="tab-enin">This parashah contains Moses’ last blessing, indeed his last words to the entire people, one nation with many attributes and possibilities. Our Jewish religious tradition of blessings is not one of passive acceptance or recognition; instead, blessings demand action. This is why, for the most part, we recite a blessing before we carry out an action.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Some say that the Hebrew word for blessing (<i>b’rachah)</i> shares the same root as the word for knee (<i>berech</i>), as in “bend the knee.” (Although there are scholars who dispute that theory, certainly our rabbis delighted in such wordplays.) When we recite a blessing, we bend ever so slightly, diminishing ourselves so as to affirm the Other and look deep into ourselves. Through prayer, we express our gratitude, ask for more blessings, and strive to reach beyond our present limitations. Acknowledging that which is not necessarily in our control, we hope for God’s gifts of a healthy, secure, and bountiful life, a life of purpose and meaning. This is Moses’ <i>b’rachah</i> to us, then and now: to gather the best within and around ourselves so as to fulfill the “promise” of the Promised Land.
</div><div class="tab-enin">After Moses blesses the tribes, he then stands atop Mount Nebo and surveys the entire land. Viewing the Negev and the valley of Jericho—city of date palms—south to Zoar, perhaps Moses is able to discard all the what if’s, should have’s, maybe’s, and if only’s. Perhaps he feels some sense of closure, an acceptance of what he could and could not accomplish in a lifetime. There is a certain humility in knowing our limits and recognizing when it is time to move on.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Part of Moses’ blessing involves the ability to dream of what he will not see or experience directly. Affirming the future is what leadership is all about: knowing and accepting that our best dreams may be realized by others who come after us. Moses’ words remind us that we need to pray and work for the blessings of justice, equality, and peace in order to fulfill our promise as individuals and to build the best family, community, society, and country that we can. We learn from Moses that sometimes we have to scale mountains in order to come closer to these blessings.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. invoked the scene on Mount Nebo in the famous speech he delivered in Memphis the day before he was assassinated (1968). He said: “Well, I don’t know what will happen now. We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn’t matter with me now. Because I’ve been to the mountaintop. And I don’t mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land” (“I See the Promised Land,” April 3, 1968). This speech turned out to be Dr. King’s last. Like Moses, his final words were a blessing for justice and peace in the service of God. This legacy of hope and vision of who we can and must become urges us on, reminding us of the dreams that remain for us to actualize.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Whenever we finish a book of the Torah in the synagogue’s cycle of readings, those who are present respond immediately with three words: <i>Chazak, chazak, v’nitchazek!</i> “Be strong, be strong [in the singular] and we will be strong [in the plural].” My late father, Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, taught: Why do we say <i>chazak</i> twice, when once would be enough? It is to tell us that if you and I each are strong, then together we are even stronger. In other words, this is a true “win/win” situation: I need you to be strong so I can be strong too.
</div><div class="tab-enin">My father’s lesson is especially true for the Jewish people today. As Jewish women, we need to be strong so that we can experience and contribute to the fullness of our Jewish tradition. Women’s entry into the leadership of Jewish life and their involvement in every aspect of communal, religious, and intellectual life is the blessing of the last 30 years. Women have opened new vistas, introduced innovations in every vital sphere of Jewish living, and empowered themselves and their daughters and granddaughters. The Jewish world has been profoundly reshaped; yet there is still a way to go. Future generations of women must continue to redefine family and work, renew ritual, scale new horizons of scholarship, write liturgy and poetry, and make music, all the while recreating the Jewish community and its structures. The Jewish people can only be strong when it embraces all of its members; it takes the involvement of both Jewish women and Jewish men to make our community fuller and more vibrant.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Thus, the reading of the Torah ends with blessings and the charge to strengthen ourselves and our community. Moses teaches us to reach for blessings for ourselves and others, to strive for the humility to know our task, and to dream of how to transform what <i>is</i> to what <i>can be.</i>
