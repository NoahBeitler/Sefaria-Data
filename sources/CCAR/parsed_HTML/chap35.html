   N THE OPENING UNITS
  </small>
  of the book of Numbers, the Israelites organize themselves for their trek to the Promised Land. Not only must they navigate through the wilderness a group that the Torah claims to include more than two million individuals (600,000 fighting men—plus women, children, and other males), but also they must maintain the proper worship of God throughout their journey.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   Parashat Naso
  </i>
  (“lift up”) focuses on the Israelite cultic structures throughout the journey. Two detailed administrative accounts frame this parashah: the Levite census (
  <a href="#num_4.21-49">
   4:21–49
  </a>
  ) and the record of the tribal chiefs’ gifts for the dedication of the altar (
  <a href="#n7-1">
   7:1–88
  </a>
  ). Whereas Leviticus typically focuses on the ritual purity of the sanctuary, Numbers is concerned with maintaining the purity of the camp as a whole.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The Israelites can protect this purity through the service of sanctified individuals like the
  <i>
   nazir
  </i>
  (
  <a href="#n6-21">
   6:1–21
  </a>
  ) or the priests (
  <a href="#page_829">
   6:22–27
  </a>
  ), as well as through responses to threats of perversion, exemplified by the ritual of the wife accused by her husband of adultery (
  <a href="#num5-11-31">
   5:11–31
  </a>
  ). (Rabbinic literature uses the term
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  to refer to aspects of this case, although the word itself —meaning “a woman who strayed”—does not actually appear in the Bible. This commentary will employ the rabbinic term, which has come to be used widely when discussing this passage.)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The structure of this parashah reflects well the role of women within the Israelite community. Women, like most men, could not be cultic officials—neither priests, Levites, nor tribal chiefs—and therefore they remain absent from the administrative framework of the parashah. Yet they occupy a central place within the religion, either as cause for concern, such as the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  , or, more surprisingly, as devotional exemplars such as the
  <i>
   nazir
  </i>
  —the individual who dedicates herself or himself to God. (The specifically feminine form is
  <i>
   n'zirah
  </i>
  , although only the generic form
  <i>
   nazir
  </i>
  appears in the Bible.)

 </div>
 <div class="image0">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  At first glance, the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  and the
  <i>
   nazir
  </i>
  seem to represent mutually exclusive ends of the spectrum for a woman’s place within Israelite society. A woman could either find herself tottering on the margins of society—accused, vulnerable, and at the mercy of her husband or priest—or she could establish her place among the elite of society by dedicating her life to God. Yet the juxtaposition of these figures within the parashah, and the linguistic links between the passages describing them, together suggest an intrinsic relationship between the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  and the
  <i>
   nazir.
  </i>
  Read together, these figures inform, challenge, and broaden our perceptions of women’s roles within the religion and society of ancient Israel.

  ccording to
  <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#N1-50">
   Numbers 1:48–49
  </a>
  , the tribe of Levi is subject to a census separate from the greater Israelite community. Although the Torah does not provide a clear reason for this, one explanation is that the men of this tribe are exempt from regular military service and assigned to protect the Tabernacle. The Torah records two levitical censuses: one counts males older than one month (
  <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#n3-19">
   3:15
  </a>
  ), and the other counts men aged 30 to 50, presumably, the work force (see
  <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#n4">
   4:1–3
  </a>
  ). The Torah does not explain why Levites could not begin service before the age of 30 nor work past 50. The mandated retirement age makes sense given the physical demands.

  o matter how well organized the Tabernacle and surrounding camp may be, the community remains vulnerable to physical and spiritual impurities. In Leviticus and Numbers, women often figure prominently in discussions of impurity. Therefore, it is no surprise that women are mentioned in each of the cases described in
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_5.1-31">
   Numbers 5
  </a>
  . Although the situations appear unrelated, they all reflect a concern for communal purity.

 <div class="head2" id="num_vv.1-4">
  PROCEDURE FOR THE PHYSICALLY IMPURE (5:1–4)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The first threat addressed is that of accidental impurity: individuals who are blameless—perhaps even passive—recipients of physical impurity resulting from disease, or from contact with the dead. Such individuals must be expelled physically before their impurity penetrates and thus defiles the sacred camp; and they must remain outside the camp until purification takes place.

  , though that passage does not mandate expulsion from the camp. Note that neither the impurity resulting from menstruation (

  ) nor from giving birth (
  <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">

  This rationale for the expulsion of these individuals from the camp makes it clear that the goal of removing the infected individuals is to protect the sanctity of the Israelite camp and maintain the divine Presence there.

Some readers consider the ritual to be unforgivably misogynistic, demonstrating the vulnerability of women and the privileged position of men in Israelite society. Others believe this ritual works to protect accused women.

  ). Both rituals are to be performed when the community faces the possibility of a capital crime without the necessary evidence to determine innocence or guilt. The
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  ritual may be a biblical example of a “trial by ordeal.” Used throughout the ancient Near East, such trials helped to decide cases in which witnesses were conflicted or lacking. The Laws of Hammurabi (see ¶ 132) provide a relevant example in which a woman is accused of adultery without evidence and must undergo a trial by ordeal in a river to determine her fate. The
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  ritual is likewise administered to a woman accused by her husband of adultery (
  <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu5-13">
   5:13–15
  </a>
  ).

  If found innocent, the vindicated woman will remain fertile. If guilty, her body will swell grotesquely; and she will presumably be rendered infertile (

  <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu22-22">
   Deuteronomy 22:22
  </a>
  ). Therefore this ritual, which does not result in death even of the guilty woman, may reflect a more compassionate form of punishment. The question “Whom does the ritual protect, the suspicious husband or the accused wife?” receives no easy answer. Because of linguistic difficulties that riddle this passage, an accurate understanding of the details of the ritual and the motivation behind them may forever elude readers. Yet the ambiguity of the passage, if not intentional, is a gift for interpreters who value indeterminate meaning in a text. Particularly for feminist readers, the ritual of the

  reflects the ambiguity of women’s roles in the Bible and the vulnerability of women within ancient Israelite society.

  One might imagine that the Torah would say that a man who has sexual relations with a married woman has, in effect, taken what belongs to another man. In this passage, however, it is the woman, and not her lover, who is accused of the crime of
  <i>
   maal,
  </i>
  misappropriation of property. Certainly, an act of adultery would be an act of betrayal. Yet the use of this term may also carry its legal meaning and suggest that the errant wife has taken something belonging to her husband—perhaps his honor, her fidelity, or the exclusive right to her sexuality.

  When referring to sexual intercourse, the subject switches from the wife to the adulterous man; grammatically, the woman thus assumes a passive position. On this idiom, see at

  </i>
  The mention of her defilement reflects one of the central concerns of this parashah: the purity of the camp depends on the purity of its members. A woman’s self-defilement suggests ethical, not ritual defilement. It was not the semen that rendered her impure, but rather her unethical betrayal of her husband.

  There are two possible readings of this phrase. One interpretation is that the phrase refers to the woman’s sexual consent, meaning that she was not raped (see how this verb is used in
  <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu22-28">

  The lack of a witness is what necessitates the ritual. According to

  </i>
  The husband’s suspicions trigger the ordeal, in order to determine whether the woman is guilty or not. Perhaps the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  trial serves mainly to allay the husband’s jealousy, in which case he, not she, is the true focus of this ritual, as some scholars suggest. Proverbs 6:34–35 describes a husband’s jealousy,

  </i>
  as a powerful and violent force.

  The text does not assume that the woman is guilty. The stated possibility that the woman is innocent supports the interpretation that the ritual works to protect her from her husband’s unfounded jealousy and restore some semblance of emotional stability to the household.

  From this point on, the narration of the ritual depicts the woman as a passive participant. The husband brings her and her “meal offering of jealousy” (
  <a href="#chap-fn15-1">
   v. 15
  </a>
  ) to the priest. The priest loosens her hair (
  <a href="#vfn18-1">

  Heb.

  The precise meaning of this expression eludes translators, who contend that a little earth does not make water bitter. Alternative translations based on different or cognate roots are “water of blessing,” “water of contention,” and “water of revelation.” Tikva Frymer-Kensky translates the phrase in vv. 18, 19, and 24, as “the ‘spell-effecting revelation waters,’ indicating that the ‘spell-effecting waters’ would enter the woman to effect the revelation of guilt or innocence” (“The Strange Case of the Suspected Sotah:
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_5.1-31">

  </a>
  ” in A. Bach, ed.,

  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#vfn16-1">
   5:17

  Although the exact nature of the potential affliction remains unclear, the damage appears to relate to the woman’s fertility. Most likely the thigh, used frequently as a euphemism for male genitalia (

  ;
  <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_1.1-22">

  ), is here a euphemism for female genitalia. Since an innocent woman will be able to conceive (
  <a href="#vfn28-1">
   5:28
  </a>
  ), the implied contrast suggests that a guilty woman will be rendered infertile. There is no reason to restrict this ritual to cases where the guilty woman is already pregnant and promptly miscarries. (For a different interpretation, see
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#page_836">
   Another View
  </a>
  .) Identifying an apt illness seems beside the point; what matters more is recognizing that the ritual targets the woman’s reproductive system—the part of her that belongs to her husband, nurtures his heirs, and secures her value within her community.

  </i>
  When the woman finally speaks, her simple acceptance of the oath contrasts with the passage’s repetitiousness and the priest’s verbosity. Though her verbal consenting to the oath is formulaic (see
  <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_27.1-26">

  After the priest dissolves the writing in the “bitter” waters, the

  </i>
  If the husband’s accusations prove false, he suffers no punishment. Yet the lack of repercussions for the wrongly suspicious husband also may protect his wife by convincing him to initiate the ritual. Assuming the “bitter” waters are humiliating but harmless, it may be better for the wife to undergo the trial than to live with a jealous husband.

  If the woman is guilty, she is not executed, as an adulteress would be. Without a witness to the crime, the woman cannot be put to death. The expression “suffer for her guilt” indicates that God, not the court, determines the punishment (

  oving beyond concerns with threats to the sanctity of the Israelite community, the parashah now focuses upon individuals who enhance and maintain that sanctity.

  With the introduction of the
  <i>

  an individual who dedicates herself or himself to God, the parashah shifts its focus from a problematic woman to a respectable, if not honored, woman or man. Yet, the shared mention of bare or untrimmed hair (

  <i>

  and the
  <i>

  Both are marginal, set apart from the community-at-large. However, while the
  <i>
   nazir
  </i>
  chooses to distinguish herself or himself, the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  is at the mercy of her husband. Placed together, these figures represent a typology, albeit extreme, of women within Israelite society that issues a message. A disciplined woman who controls her wildness and dedicates herself (and her wildness) to God may become a
  <i>
   n’zirah
  </i>
  (the specifically feminine form of
  <i>
   nazir).

  One who does not discipline her wildness may become a

  <i>
   nazir
  </i>
  pertain to prohibitions, they reveal little about whether or how the
  <i>
   nazir

  functioned within the community. Although nazirites behaved similarly to priests in certain ways, there is no indication that they served alongside them in the sanctuary. Still, the existence of female nazirites illustrates that women, like men, could and did dedicate themselves to God.

  The word
  <i>
   nazir
  </i>
  comes from the root
  <i>
   n-z-r,
  </i>
  meaning to “dedicate” or “to set aside,” and may be related to the root
  <i>

  meaning “vow.” Women can make binding vows; according to
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#n29-39">
   Numbers 30
  </a>
  , either their fathers or their husbands can annul them, but only upon first hearing of them (
  <a href="45_chapter_42.xhtml#n30-4">
   30:4–16
  </a>
  ). Thus, a married woman or a daughter in her father’s house—unlike a widow or a divorcée living on her own—depends on the consent of a man in order to become a
  <i>
   nazir.
  </i>
  The two biblical nazirites, Samuel and Samson, are designated as nazirites by their mothers. During her pregnancy, Samson’s unnamed mother follows the prohibitions for the
  <i>
   nazir
  </i>
  in Numbers and effectively becomes a temporary nazirite herself (Judges 13:3–5, 13–14).

  Untrimmed hair is the defining physical characteristic of the
  <i>

  and reflects the vitality of an individual dedicated to God. In ancient cultures, hair—which grows throughout life and appears to grow even in death—represented vitality and was often offered as a gift to one’s deity. In the Bible, hair also reflects a character’s strength. A haircut renders mighty Samson impotent (Judges 16:17); the hair of a captive woman must be shaved at first as a sign of mourning (

   Leviticus 9:22
  </a>
  , at the conclusion of the ceremony consecrating the priests and the Tabernacle, Aaron raises his hands and blesses the community of Israel. Although the text does not report Aaron’s words, rabbinic commentators suggest that he recites
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#n6-24">
   Numbers 6:24–27
  </a>
  , which has become known as the “Priestly Blessing.” Its words affirm that God blesses and protects, deals kindly and graciously, bestows favor, and grants peace. Each of its three verses contains two blessings, yet the verses expand in length from three to five to seven words, suggesting that God’s blessing expands. Verse 27 echoes both the form and content of v. 23, creating an envelope structure for the blessing.

  CONCLUSION (7:89)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Although the parashah is concerned mostly with the sanctity of the community at large and with the individuals responsible for that sanctity, it concludes by describing a private moment between God and Moses. Whereas the moment appears intimate, the verse makes clear that even Moses stands at an appropriate distance from the Divine when he enters the Tabernacle’s interior. Despite the promise in the Priestly Blessing that God’s “face” will shine down upon Israel (see at
  <a href="#chap-fn25-3">
   6:25
  </a>
  ), Moses’ experience of revelation is purely auditory. Even Israel’s greatest leader, the only one who elsewhere speaks to God face-to-face or mouth-to-mouth (

   DESCRIBES
  </small>
  the ordeal of the
  <i>
   sotah,
  </i>
  the so-called errant wife or “woman accused of adultery.” If a man suspects that his wife has been unfaithful but lacks proof, she is brought to the priest, who puts her through a magical trial or ordeal to ascertain her innocence or guilt. We are not told what brings about the husband’s “fit of jealousy” (
  <a href="#chap-fn14-1">
   v. 14
  </a>
  ) nor is the spell-induced outcome for the guilty wife plainly described. The text simply states: “if she has defiled herself by breaking faith with her husband…her belly shall distend and her thigh shall sag; and the wife shall become a curse among her people” (
  <a href="#vfn27-1">
   v. 27
  </a>
  ). However, if the woman is innocent, she will be “unharmed and able to retain seed” (
  <a href="#vfn28-1">
   v. 28
  </a>
  ). This verse provides the clue to the entire passage; it helps us understand why the husband suspects his wife in the first place, and how to interpret the symptoms that the guilty woman will suffer.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <a href="#vfn28-1">
   Verse 28
  </a>
  is best understood to mean that the innocent wife will be able to maintain her pregnancy. If so, then the context of the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  ritual can be seen as involving a pregnant woman whose husband suspects that he is not the father. It is the husband’s distrust of the origin of his wife’s pregnancy that causes the “fit of jealousy.” Therefore, the central issue is paternity: if the wife is innocent and the husband is truly the unborn child’s father, then the fetus will grow to term. It follows, therefore, that if the wife is guilty and the husband is not the father, then the wife will not be able “to retain seed.” That is, the spell of the ordeal will induce a miscarriage: “if she has defiled herself by breaking faith with her husband…her belly shall distend and her thigh shall sag” (
  <a href="#vfn27-1">
   v. 27
  </a>
  ). Ultimately, regardless of how we today might assess paternity, in the biblical context an intact pregnancy after this ritual is sufficient proof that the husband had indeed fathered this child.

  ). This passage speaks of a woman whom her husband accuses of adultery, even though he has insufficient evidence to convict her. The Rabbis later developed
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num5-11-31">
   Numbers 5:11–31
  </a>
  into an entire tractate in the Talmud, called
  <i>
   Sotah,
  </i>
  “the errant wife.” It describes in detail the ordeal that she will endure, filling in much that the Torah does not mention, but also encasing this ritual in a set of rules that transform it into an unusual and infrequent event. According to Mishnah
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  1:1, only if a husband warns his wife in advance not to seclude herself with a particular man, and only if there are witnesses to the warning and to the act of seclusion,
  <a id="page_837">
  </a>
  only then may he force her to go with him to the Temple. Since such a complex sequence of events is unlikely to happen, the chances of administering this degrading ritual decrease dramatically. The Rabbis also stipulate, based on close readings of the biblical verses, that the waters would test not only the woman suspected of infidelity but also her supposed partner. They add that if a jealous husband had himself committed adultery in the past, then the waters would not be able to harm his wife (BT
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  47b).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  According to Mishnah
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  9:9, this ritual was abolished toward the end of the Second Temple period. [That mishnah attributes the suspension of the ritual to Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, who acted in light of a proliferation in adultery during that era. He cited the prophet Hosea to explain why it was no longer meaningful to accuse wives of unfaithfulness in an atmosphere of widespread dissipation: “I will not punish their daughters for fornicating / Nor their daughters-in-law for committing adultery; / For they themselves turn aside with whores / And sacrifice with prostitutes, / And a people that is without sense must stumble” (4:14). —

    If any…women explicitly utter a nazirite’s vow
   </i>
  </b>
  (
  <a href="#num_6.1-27">
   6:2
  </a>
  ). Since a female nazirite was required to bring the sacrifice, just like a male, the Torah implies that women owned and controlled property. Mishnah
  <i>
   Nazir
  </i>
  refers to two women who took nazirite vows: Miriam of Tadmor became a nazirite to pray for her sick daughter (
  <a href="#vfn11-1">
   6:11
  </a>
  ), and Queen Helena of Adiabene, a 1st-century-
  <small>
   C.E.
  </small>
  convert to Judaism, vowed to become a nazirite for seven years if her son returned safely from war (3:6). Josephus mentions the nazirite vow of Berenice of the Herodian royal family (
  <i>
   Wars of the Jews
  </i>
  2, 15:1). Thus, we learn that becoming a nazirite in the rabbinic period was viewed as a way of prompting God to answer one’s prayers, often on behalf of family members in difficult circumstances. Clearly, these traditions presume that women chose this option when they found themselves in situations of personal duress.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">

    Thus shall you bless the people of Israel
   </i>
  </b>
  (

  ). The three-fold priestly blessing appears immediately after a number of other topics, such as the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  and the nazirite, that require the involvement of priests. Women could not serve as priests and hence did not utter this blessing. Although the verses that frame the blessing appear in the plural (

   6:23
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="#chap-fn27-3">

According to the talmudic sources, the main venue for the recitation of the priestly blessing was the Temple in Jerusalem, until it was destroyed in 70

   OTAH RITUAL
  </small>
  (
  <a href="#num5-11-31">
   5:11–31
  </a>
  ), in which a man suspects his wife of adultery and subjects her to an ordeal, has been notoriously difficult for contemporary readers, especially from a feminist perspective. The unequal application of the ritual to women and not men, the lack of due process, the physical and emotional humiliation—all of these combine to make this passage a challenging place in which to find meaning.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  As such, this passage keeps company with a number of other biblical texts that are problematic, even painful, to read. Rabbi Rebecca Alpert offers a valuable model for confronting such troubling teachings. In her book
  <i>
   Like Bread on a Seder Plate: Jewish Lesbians and the Transformation of Tradition
  </i>
  (1997), Alpert presents a number of approaches for dealing with traditional texts on homosexuality. She suggests that we can understand these texts by interpreting them in the context of their own time and place. We also can try to wrest new meaning from them, or we can simply acknowledge the pain that they have caused—and continue to cause. These approaches are not, of course, mutually exclusive, and they can apply also to this parashah.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Certainly in the case of the
  <i>
   sotah,
  </i>
  we can analyze it in light of its historical context. Comparing this passage with other ancient Near Eastern texts reveals it to be in keeping with other laws contemporary to Torah times.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In terms of the pain the passage has caused, we can easily imagine its effect on women thousands of years ago, but we ourselves are spared direct impact. Modern readers have long taken solace in the fact that this practice is no longer in force—and thus is far from the purview of synagogue ritual committees. In fact, it is unclear whether this ritual ever took place. Even in the Torah, the law is given without a connection to any particular incident. The Mishnah states that an early rabbinic leader discontinued the ritual of the
  <i>
   sotah (Sotah
  </i>
  9:9). The entire body of rabbinic literature cites only one example of its implementation. Regarding the medieval period, a little-known fragment from the Cairo Geniza still gives instructions as to how to perform the ritual in one’s neighborhood synagogue; but there too, no record has been found of anyone actually doing so. (For details, see Lisa Grushcow,
  <i>
   Writing the Wayward Wife: Rabbinic Interpretations of Sotah,
  </i>
  2006, pp. 297–300.)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  When we try to understand the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  ritual in context, we can be relieved that it has not been implemented for at least two thousand years. But how can we wrest meaning from this difficult text? Interestingly, the very discontinuation of the ritual—and the rabbinic explanation of its abandonment—may give us a way to find meaning. The official suspension of the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  ritual provides an example of how religious and legal change happens, and how such change is explained. For those of us who are committed to the Torah and also see Judaism as a path that embraces change, this is a crucial issue.
 </div>
 <div class="image">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="image0">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Some modern scholars assume that the ritual of the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  disappeared because of the destruction of the Temple. Others argue that the ritual was abolished as a bold rabbinic move, to remove a practice that was seen to be unfair. But when one looks closely at the rabbinic texts, neither of these reasons is found. Rather, the explanation given is that things were getting worse—either more people were openly committing adultery, or more husbands were sinning in such a way that the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  ritual did not then work on their wives. The Rabbis account for these and other
  <a id="page_839">
  </a>
  examples of decline by claiming that the deaths of certain sages led to the disappearance of certain qualities from the world (see for example, Mishnah
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  9:9).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Thus, in these rabbinic texts,
  <i>
   change results from a world that is getting worse.
  </i>
  It is also worth noting that we find a similar outlook in the Greco-Roman world that surrounded the ancient rabbis. From that perspective, religious and legal changes were a response to moral, sexual, intellectual, or political collapse.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Coming back to the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  ritual, then, it seems that our ancestors did not abolish the ritual because they found it morally objectionable. Instead, they used the best conceptual tools of their time to make sense of why change had happened, and those tools explained change as the product of decline.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Our modern paradigm, in contrast, is fundamentally based on the assumptions of science, the Enlightenment, and Emancipation:
  <i>
   we believe that it is possible for humanity to make changes based on progress,
  </i>
  not decline. The optimism of the Enlightenment has been tempered by the Holocaust and other tragedies of modern times, but the fundamental shift remains. For us, change can be positive, even holy. We believe that God continues to speak to us. Living in accordance with our new understandings of gender and sexual identity has enriched our clergy and communities. Living in a world more openly diverse has taught us the importance of outreach and inreach for our communities, in all their diversity. Scientific insights spur us to find new ethical and spiritual answers to questions of life and death. The existence of the modern state of Israel challenges us to live richer Jewish lives, wherever we are in the world. These changes and others are celebrated, not lamented as evidence of decline.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Ultimately, then, the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  ritual is most powerful as a teacher of change: how we understood change in the past, and how we might understand it now. Just as the Rabbis of the Mishnah and Talmud used the best conceptual tools of their time to understand change, so must we—with the tools of our own time. Such an approach is not abandoning our tradition; it is being true to it.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The end of the Babylonian Talmud’s tractate on
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  gives us a glimmer of possibility: some of our ancestors might also have had a different perspective on change and decline. Mishnah
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  9:9 ends with the statement that with the death of Rabbi Judah haNasi, humility and the fear of sin disappeared. In the Talmud’s commentary, this statement is challenged. “Do not teach that humility is gone,” says Rav Joseph, “for I am still here!” “Do not teach that the fear of sin is gone,” says Rav Nachman, “for I am still here!” (BT
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  49b). Rav Nachman’s self-proclaimed fear of sin—not to mention Rav Joseph’s self-proclaimed humility—suggests that our ancestors, like ourselves, thought that they still had something to add.
