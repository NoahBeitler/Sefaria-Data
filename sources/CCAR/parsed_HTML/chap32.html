  (“at the mountain [of]”) contains laws that aim to protect economically disadvantaged members of the community from permanently losing their freedom and means of livelihood. In Israel, as in other parts of the ancient Near East, those households that fell into economically precarious situations risked losing their land; moreover, their members might become indentured servants or slaves. Israel, like its neighbors, developed legislation to prevent the rich from exploiting the poor. This parashah highlights economic and social concerns through a theological lens. In the process, it expresses what it means for the Israelites to be both a holy people and God’s freed servants. Ethics and social justice do not constitute a separate sphere from ritual in the book of Leviticus but are integral to it. See, for example, the laws at the end of
  <i>
   parashat Vayikra
  </i>
  (
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#L5-20">
   5:20–26
  </a>
  ).
  <i>
   Parashat B’har
  </i>
  illustrates how the demand for holiness needs to be implemented in socio-economic practices, making it possible for economically disadvantaged Israelites to “come back home” to family and land.

  , seeks to provide a safety net to preserve and protect land-holdings and economic stability. In other parts of the ancient Near East, kings issued royal edicts in an attempt to restore economic balance by canceling certain debts, especially when the rulers ascended to the throne. The jubilee legislation envisions a permanently regulated system for adjusting economic imbalance every 50 years, independently of the goodwill of rulers. The legislation also serves to protect the land itself from exploitation. The rationale for land protection is theological: the land belongs to God; moreover, the destiny of the land and of the people are intertwined.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  The laws include the following: (1) land must lie fallow every seventh year and in the fiftieth (jubilee) year; (2) land holdings must return to their original owners at the jubilee year or be redeemed earlier; (3) indentured servants or slaves must be released at the jubilee year or be redeemed earlier.
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.1">
   Leviticus 25

  is the only place in the Torah that describes the jubilee laws. Its laws, however, stand in tension with those in Exodus and Deuteronomy that institute release in the seventh year.

  The only women explicitly mentioned in this parashah are slaves or servants (the Hebrew
  <i>
   amah
  </i>
  could mean either; see at
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
   v. 44
  </a>
  ).
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.2-7">
   Leviticus 25:6–7
  </a>
  states that female slaves or servants, like male ones, are to benefit from the land’s Sabbath;
  <a id="page_748">
  </a>
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
   vv. 44–46
  </a>
  state that foreign slaves, including women, are to remain slaves in perpetuity (unlike Israelite slaves).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The language of release and redemption in the parashah takes the masculine form but functions inclusively to refer to both women and men. Other biblical texts illuminate how such laws would apply to women. Narratives such as
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  and
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
   36
  </a>
  describe women inheriting land; II Kings 4, 6, and Nehemiah 5 depict situations in which women are subject to loss of freedom and land due to destitution; Jeremiah 34 refers to the release of female slaves; and Ruth 4 describes the redemption of land sold by Naomi. Clearly, conditions that drive persons into servitude—and the resolutions of those conditions that Leviticus requires—apply to women as well as to men.

  he land, like the people, must have a sabbath rest, and therefore it must lie fallow every seventh year. The idea may seem like a utopian fantasy, but Baruch Levine points out that letting the land lie fallow was a practical aspect of ancient agriculture, especially where extensive irrigation was utilized. He explains that it “served to reduce the quantity of alkalines, sodium and calcium deposited in the soil” (
  <i>
   Leviticus
  </i>
  , 1989, p. 272) and thus helped preserve the land’s fertility. Practical considerations aside, for Leviticus this law expresses the supremacy of God, to whom Israel and the land ultimately belong.

  Unlike the weekly Shabbat that the Israelites are to observe in all places and at all times, the land’s

  is to be observed only in the Land of Israel.

  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">

  also mandates letting the land lie fallow every seventh year. Scholars suggest that Exodus refers to a rotating fallow year; each Israelite farmer would calculate every seventh year individually for his or her own parcel of land. Our parashah, however, describes a uniform calendar in which every farmer must observe the fallow year at the same seventh year, as part of a fiftieth-year jubilee. Josephus, the 1st-century Jewish historian, reports that the Jews were exempt from a certain imperial tax on the seventh year “which they call the Sabbatical Year, because thereon they neither receive the fruits of their trees, nor do they sow their land” (
  <i>
   Antiquities of the Jews

  Israelite farmers and their households may eat from the aftergrowth of their fields—making it possible for families to live off the land. With a fixed seventh-year land rest, only fallow land would be available every seven years. Because this system would not provide a social network for the poor,
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   Leviticus 19:9–10
  </a>
  and
  <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_23.22">
   23:22
  </a>
  state that one must leave the edges of one’s field and the gleanings of one’s harvest for the poor and the stranger, and not pick one’s vineyards bare or gather fallen fruit. (
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
   Exodus 23
  </a>
  does not specify these provisions but implies a rotation of fallow land; see the previous comment.)

  </i>
  Here the Hebrew term for ‘‘you’’ is masculine singular, yet it clearly includes the entire extended family. This usage confirms that elsewhere the text’s second-person masculine language does not necessarily exclude women from its audience.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  This phrase contains one of only two explicit references to females in the parashah (see also
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">

  ubilee laws demand the release of land and persons every fifty years. The purpose of the laws is to ensure the economic and social freedom of the Israelites, whom God collectively redeemed from slavery in Egypt. These statutes attempt to preserve land tenure. (In
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">

  , clan leaders—concerned about land transfer to another tribe—invoke the laws of the jubilee when they raise questions about the land granted to Zelophehad’s daughters, Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.) The laws also aim to guarantee that no Israelite will be permanently destitute. Land and people constitute the most basic resources necessary to ensure livelihood. Therefore, the jubilee laws address these issues together—and in doing so, solidify the claim that only God can own Israelite people and land.

  In this verse, the assumed relationship is between one Israelite and another—a relationship of equals. Elsewhere, the Torah commands the Israelites not to wrong a stranger, a foreigner (

  These verses address pragmatic concerns regarding the economic viability of the jubilee system. God promises agricultural surplus and instructs the Israelites how to prepare for it and use it.

  Once the ancient Israelites are established in the Land of Israel, they live in an agricultural society—in which land equals life. Selling a portion of one’s inherited holding would mean giving up a vital source of livelihood, because most Israelites are members of farm families that depend on the land’s produce. Such a sale would be a first step in the slippery slope toward potential destitution. Jubilee laws presume that agricultural land holdings are inalienable: they belong to God, who gave each one to a particular Israelite clan in perpetuity.

Boaz invites the other man to redeem the land, though he proposes to redeem it himself if this potential redeemer does not (4:1–12). The land is presumably expected to revert back to Naomi’s (or Ruth’s) heir, which may explain why the less affluent relative lets wealthy Boaz acquire the land. It is noteworthy that Naomi sells the land but that Boaz negotiates on her behalf.

   Laws to Protect Israelites from Debt-Slavery
  </i>
  (25:35–54)

 <div class="tab-en">
  Debt-slavery represents the most severe consequence of insolvency. Some biblical evidence suggests that daughters may have been especially vulnerable to being used as indentured labor for the household’s debts (see at
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
   Exodus 21:7–11
  </a>
  ). Thus indenture may have been particularly unfortunate for nubile females, whose virginity (and thus marriageability) may have been at risk in an indentured context. At the same time, it is possible that children benefited from access to food in the more affluent household to which they were indentured.

  A drought, a bad harvest, or an illness might force a farmer to seek loans. To help prevent decline into irreversible poverty, these verses permit only interest-free loans to fellow Israelites (a practice that is still maintained today through the “Hebrew Free Loan” associations). Ancient Mesopotamian documents show interest rates for loans of money, seed, or food as high as 60 percent. Such rates would make repayment impossible and push the debtor deeper into destitution.

  , Leviticus does not mention cancellation of debt). The prohibition also applies to confiscating a pledge (person or property) when the loan is delinquent. The book of Kings mentions a widow who begs the prophet Elisha to help her: “a creditor is coming to take away my two sons to be his slaves” (II Kings 4:1; Elisha provides a miraculous source of oil, which enables her to pay off the creditor and keep her family intact, 4:7).

  These verses address the next stage of economic decline: insolvency that forces persons into debt-servitude. The children of the widow in II Kings 4:1 (see previous comment) are subject to such servitude. Likewise, Nehemiah 5 describes the predicament of Judeans in the 5th century
  <small>
   B.C.E.

  : “There was a great outcry by the common people and their wives against their fellow Jews. Some said, ‘Our sons and daughters are numerous; we must get grain to eat in order that we may live!’ Others said, ‘We must pawn our fields, our vineyards, and our homes to get grain to stave off hunger.’ Yet others said, ‘We have borrowed money against our fields…we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery—some of our daughters are already subjected—and we are powerless’” (Nehemiah 5:1–5).

  The Hebrew uses masculine language (which, in its most restricted sense, means “he and his sons with him”), raising the question whether wives and other female members of the family are to receive their freedom (see
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#page_760">
   Another View
  </a>
  ). Presumably a daughter, if she became sexually attached to a man in the “owner’s” house, did not have the option of release; however, she might have other legal protections (see at
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
   Exodus 21:7–11
  </a>
  ). In Jeremiah 34:12–16, a law about slavery formulated in masculine language explicitly applies to women as well as men. (That passage describes the release of slave women and men in a time of siege. Jeremiah also notes, however, that these released slaves are repossessed shortly after, and he condemns the repossession as profaning God’s name.) Here, too, there is no reason to exclude women from view; war, famine, plague, and the like could easily put women in the position of becoming debt-slaves if they (or their husbands) suddenly found themselves without the normal protection of a household or clan and its access to land. To convey the gender-inclusive sense of the Hebrew wording, the translation here uses plural language.

  Indentured foreign females and males do not go free. When sold into slavery, foreigners become the Israelites’ possession “for all time” (v. 46). This harsh ruling contradicts other laws in Leviticus that specify an identical law for the Israelite, the foreigner, and the resident alien (as
  <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_24.22">

  and
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_15.1-41">

  A family member must redeem an Israelite whom a resident alien purchases or seizes to cover a debt. The price of redemption is to be determined fairly on the basis of expected years of servitude until the year of the jubilee. These laws apply only within Israelite settlements in the Land of Israel. The Bible meanwhile includes some stories about Israelite slaves in non-Israelite households outside the land. One such anecdote in II Kings 5:1–4 mentions a young Israelite slave girl (a war captive) serving a household in a neighboring country. Seeing that her mistress’s husband—the general Naaman—had contracted a skin disease (
  <i>
   tzaraat

  ), the Israelite slave girl informs the wife that a prophet in Israel could cure the husband. Grace Aguilar, the English Jewish poet, novelist, and theologian (1817–1847), claimed that this story was proof that even a young slave girl in biblical times knew about her “Jewish” tradition and resources. Aguilar used this story to campaign for extending Jewish education to women in her own time.

   serve
  </i>
  Me!” (
  <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#exo_7.8-9.35">
   Exodus 7:16
  </a>
  ). Significantly, many editions translate the verb

  </i>
  in
  <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#exo_7.8-9.35">
   Exodus 7:16

   HE BIBLICAL SYSTEM
  </small>
  of a jubilee year has been described as utopian in its vision, promoting a system whereby lands sold under financial distress would be returned to the original owners every fifty years. Under this system, there are checks and balances ensuring a redistribution of wealth at set intervals. This is indeed a utopian vision, grounded both in the religious belief that only God owns the land and people are but tenants on it, and in the socio-economic vision of a remission of debts at set periods.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  One would like to think that if this legislation had been in force during some period in history, it would have had a beneficial impact on women and other vulnerable members of society. However, the text does not seem to address many questions regarding the status of women under this system. For example,
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
   Leviticus 25:41
  </a>
  uses only grammatically masculine language and male terms to refer to an Israelite who becomes the debt-slave of a fellow Israelite. The text forbids that individual from being treated as a (non-Israelite) slave. The text literally reads that at the year of the jubilee, “he and his children with him shall be free” (
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.41">
   25:41
  </a>
  ). Where is the wife? Commentators often argue that she must be included here, but it is striking that she is missing. According to
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
   Exodus 21:2–6
  </a>
  , a male Hebrew slave is released after six years of service, but a female slave apparently remains with her master forever—presumably, according to some interpreters, because she has become the sexual property of the owner (
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
   21:7–11
  </a>
  ). The law in
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
   Exodus 21
  </a>
  , in conjunction with the absence of women in the jubilee laws, prompts disturbing questions.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Similarly,
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
   Leviticus 25:47–49
  </a>
  spells out the order of kinsfolk who are required to redeem relatives sold to non-Israelites. The order begins with brothers, uncles, and then male cousins. Again the text is silent on women, suggesting that only men were active participants in this utopian vision of release from servitude and reclamation of ancestral lands.

 <div class="image0">

 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  However, a close reading of the text, along with a study of other sources, demonstrates that despite the seeming omission of women in this account, women were in fact recognized as active participants in all these cases. Jeremiah 34 mentions the release of women slaves; and
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  and
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
   36
  </a>
  show that women could own land and thus have resources to redeem relatives.

  </a>
  ). The discussion of this passage in the midrash collection
  <i>
   Sifra
  </i>
  leads us to one of the most important passages in rabbinic literature, one in which women play central roles. The Rabbis explain the apparent repetition of the command not to oppress one’s neighbor as follows: Each verse speaks of a different kind of oppression; the oppression of
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
   v. 14
  </a>
  is economic oppression, while that in
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
   v. 17
  </a>
  is inflicted psychologically. The Tosefta repeats this interpretation in
  <i>
   Bava M’tzia
  </i>
  3:25–29,
  <a id="page_761">
  </a>
  and the Talmud deeply explores the issues in BT
  <i>
   Bava M’tzia
  </i>
  58b–6ob. There we learn how important feelings are, and how critical it is for us not to hurt them. According to the Rabbis, the archetypal example of someone who preferred death to hurting another person’s feelings is Tamar (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
   Genesis 38
  </a>
  ). The Rabbis maintain that rather than shame her father-in-law in public, she was willing to be burned to death. We then learn that it is especially important not to distress one’s wife (BT
  <i>
   Bava M’tzia
  </i>
  59a and subsequently in
  <i>
   Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat
  </i>
  228:3). A husband can easily wound his wife’s feelings because she is close to him, and he also has many opportunities to hurt her. He must therefore take proportionately more care not to do so. We learn, too, of the counter-example of Rav’s difficult marriage. Rav asserted that anyone who followed his wife’s advice would descend into
  <i>
   Geihinom
  </i>
  (the place of eternal punishment). When we examine a description of his married life, we can see why he might say this. His wife is said to have constantly tormented him and contradicted his smallest wish (BT
  <i>
   Y’vamot
  </i>
  63a). Of course, this androcentric text does not consider how Rav’s treatment of his spouse may have contributed to such behavior.

  Rav Pappa seems to have had a good marriage, since he quotes the folk saying that if one’s wife is short, one should bend down and listen to her opinion. Other teachings are likewise designed to increase marital harmony. One such teaching urges that grain always be available in the home, as lack of food is often the cause of marital strife. We learn, too, that a husband should be careful to honor his wife more than he honors himself. He should show this by dressing her in better clothes than he himself wears (BT
  <i>
   Bava M’tzia
  </i>
  59a and subsequently in
  <i>
   Mishneh Torah, Sefer Nashim, Hilchot Ishut
  </i>
  15:19). In the same passage, Rav Helbo asserts that blessings are found in a man’s house only on account of his wife; and Rava opines that honoring one’s wife is the road to wealth.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  What follows is one of the most famous legends in all of rabbinic literature. It appears in BT
  <i>
   Bava M’tzia
  </i>
  59b and concerns Rabbi Eliezer and his wife, Imma Shalom (which means “Mother of Peace”). Imma Shalom came from a distinguished family of Davidic heritage. Her brother was Rabban Gamliel, who, at that time, presided over the academy in which her husband, Rabbi Eliezer, was one of the greatest sages. Her husband had a strong disagreement of opinion with the rest of the academy. When they would not accept his opinion he brought all sorts of supernatural proofs that his was the correct view. Even a voice out of heaven was summoned, which duly testified that he was, in fact, right. At this, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Eliezer’s study partner, stood up and said, “The Torah is no longer in heaven” (
  <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#deu_30.11-20">
   Deuteronomy 30:12
  </a>
  ). In other words, we decide law and practice here on earth and do not take heavenly voices into account. Finally, Rabban Gamliel expelled Rabbi Eliezer from the academy, and he was excommunicated. Imma Shalom, knowing what harm her husband could do out of the pain of his humiliation, kept watch on Rabbi Eliezer day and night, so that he would not have the opportunity to pray for Rabban Gamliel’s death. One day her attention was diverted, and she saw afterward that Rabbi Eliezer was prostrated on the ground, supplicating God for succor from his hurt feelings. Seeing this, she said, “Rise. You have killed my brother!” At that moment a shofar blast was heard, signaling that Rabban Gamliel had died. Rabbi Eliezer then asked his wife, “How did you know my prayer worked, and I had killed him?” She replied, quoting learning as easily and with as much authority as her husband, “I learned it from my grandfather’s house: All the gates of heaven are locked except for the gates of hurt feelings.”

  , God declares to Moses that the land is a sacred trust and commands the people to observe periods of comprehensive release. This parashah invites us to consider how, in each generation, we can best serve as guarantors of this trust, respect the duty to rest ourselves and our natural resources, and experience “release.” The legislation in
  <i>
   B’har
  </i>
  presumes the value of balance and regulates a balance among productivity, rest, and relinquishment. Inasmuch as punctuating productivity with long pauses lends perspective to life and encourages us to express gratitude for the earth’s bounty, we may wonder what regulations we require today to help us nurture ourselves, one another, and the planet. As women join men in leadership positions and in the work force, it is becoming a Jewish communal priority to effect social and institutional adjustments that allow for a healthy balance between people’s needs and obligations.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   B’har
  </i>
  affirms that the land belongs to God, and it must be permitted to observe its Sabbaths. The sensibility that the Land of Israel has a responsibility all its own to the Creator recognizes nature’s independence from humanity. The land must be permitted, just like human servants, to praise creation through Shabbat. In the psalmist’s words:
  <i>
   kol han’shamah t’halel Yah,
  </i>
  “All that breathes praises God” (Psalm 150). The earth must speak its own gratitude.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In the Torah, the earth is an expressive organism. We read that when Miriam died, “the community was without water” (
  <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_20.1-29">
   Numbers 20:2
  </a>
  ). Observing, as it were, its mourning for a heroine whose miracles were all associated with water, the earth dries up. To hear the speech of the earth is a blessing; but if we do not listen, the consequences of our deafness to the planet are traumatic. The ecology movement reminds us of what our biblical forebears understood: the independent consciousness of nature.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Nature’s independence is trumpeted on Yom Kippur after a fifty-year countdown. This is when we must (as the Liberty Bell translates the verse) “proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof” (
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
   Leviticus 25:10
  </a>
  ). We more closely translate
  <i>
   dror
  </i>
  (“Liberty”) as a proclamation of “release,” a letting go. Counting toward release, we can celebrate release—or we can live in fear of it. And so the liturgy tells us
  <i>
   limnot yameinu,
  </i>
  to count our days (Psalm 90:12), by which we are meant to understand that since our days are numbered, the trick is to make them count. Our duty is not to scramble tirelessly, but to be grateful and generous, to assume our small place in creation, and to join the trees in praise. Underlying the laws of
  <i>
   B’har
  </i>
  is an obligation to take care of each other, to leave no one homeless: “Do not wrong one another, but fear your God” (
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
   Leviticus 25:17
  </a>
  ).

  The laws of the sabbatical year echo biblical Creation. The rhythm of the work week undergoes a cosmic magnification: people, imitating the Creator, are productive for six days and then rest. Nature is productive for six years and rests; and then geometrically, after the land has maintained this rhythm for seven cycles of seven: jubilee. The
  <i>
   yovel,
  </i>
  the jubilee, is a call to restore primal order: indentured servants are freed, debts are forgiven, and property is restored to its original owners. Here is a caution against struggling to amass more, and against warring over real estate—reminding us that all things are, eventually, released (one way or another) from our possession and control. After the divine promise to Noah that humanity would never again be destroyed by flood, God devises the jubilee as a peaceful strategy for restoring the world to its original state.

  Appreciating that freedom must be learned, a midrash teaches that the Israelites wandered in desert circles for forty years to make the short trip from Egypt to Canaan because it took that long for the slave population to learn how to manage its freedom. Today, it behooves us to reflect on the substantial gains of the women’s movement and admit that, as
  <i>
   B’har
  </i>
  teaches, we suffer the consequences of depletion if we do not adequately regulate our hard-won freedoms. Not only do many of us live unbalanced lives, but schools and charities have not corrected for the absence of an earlier generation of volunteer women, to the detriment of children and the poor. Society needs to effect adjustments so as to make two-career families more viable; and we risk perpetuating conditions of stress at work and home if we do not emphasize to rising generations the need to change existing institutional structures and correct continued gender inequities. One wonders whether, in the years since the onset of the contemporary women’s movement, we have been panting from exertion without having paused often enough to ask about the meaning of life. High-achieving adolescents too often suffer from depression, and teenage girls suffer from diminished self-worth. Perhaps we have been communicating an unbalanced definition of adulthood—adulthood without sabbatical and jubilation.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  The land, our possessions, our bodies, our children, and we ourselves are a sacred trust, and it is not our right to be infinitely demanding on them. We are commanded to rest, not when we are exhausted or having a breakdown, but regularly, as we count the days to
