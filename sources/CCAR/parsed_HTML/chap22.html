<div class="chap2" id="ch-22"><i>Making a Place for God: The Tabernacle’s Components
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYAK’HEIL</small> (“he convoked”) begins the portion of Exodus known as the <i>descriptive</i> Tabernacle texts (Exodus 35–40) because they describe the implementation of the earlier instructions. God gives detailed instructions to Moses about the Tabernacle, its materials, and its personnel in Exodus 25–30, known as the <i>prescriptive</i> Tabernacle texts because they prescribe what is to be done. While the Golden Calf episode in <i>Ki Tisa</i> seems to interrupt the Tabernacle account, its overall message—that the people can sin and still have their covenant with God affirmed—may be an integral part of the Tabernacle concept. The Golden Calf incident indicates that the people seem to doubt God’s presence among them and God’s commitment to them. Only after that incident is resolved, with God and the people reconciled, can they proceed to build the shrine. The people now feel sure that God will be with them even if they do disobey God’s word.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The disobedience that marks the preceding parashah now contrasts sharply with the people’s willing complicity in carrying out the directives for building the Tabernacle. An introductory unit (35:1–36:7) reviews the Sabbath precept, describes the collection of donations, and designates the artisans who are to collect and use the materials. The next three units report the implementation of God’s commands to build the Tabernacle: the tent (36:8–38), its furnishings (37:1–29), and the courtyard with its installations (38:1–20).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Much of the information presented in the elaborate instructions for making the Tabernacle and priestly vestments (the prescriptive texts in Exodus 25–31) is repeated, at times word-for-word, in this parashah and the next. While the content of the accounts is almost identical, the order is significantly different. Instead of presenting the components in order of degree of sanctity—starting with the Ark and the other golden furnishings—the description of their fabrication proceeds according to technological logic: first the structure itself is erected (36:8–38), then the interior furnishings are made (37:1–29), and finally the courtyard and its installations are constructed (38:1–20). The descriptive texts are somewhat briefer because they omit information about how items are to be used, indicating an interest in fabrication rather than function. Another major difference is that in the descriptive texts Moses is much more prominent than Aaron—the dominant figure in the prescriptive passages. It is fitting that Aaron is less important following the Golden Calf episode, since he was considered complicit in the people’s sinfulness.

</div><div class="tab-enin">Although the priestly personnel apparently are all men, as are the chief artisans, women appear in this parashah as significant contributors of materials. They also are the ones who turn the raw materials of textile production into the requisite fabrics. Because woven fabrics are key components of the tent shrine, the skilled labor of female artisans (35:25–26) is integral to the construction of the Tabernacle (see also <i>T’rumah</i>, Another View; <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View). In addition, the surprising mention of “women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (38:8) hints at roles performed by women at the sanctuary.

</div><div class="tab-en">Before the Israelites begin carrying out the instructions for constructing the Tabernacle, several introductory steps must be taken. The first part of this parashah begins with two directives, the first concerning the Sabbath (35:1–3) and the second concerning materials (35:4–19). Next comes an account of the people’s response to this call for contributions (35:20–29). Finally, the appointment of artisans to with the materials that begin pouring in is announced (35:30–36:7).
</div><div class="head2" id="exo_35.1-3">SABBATH OBSERVANCE (35:1–3)
</div><div class="tab-enin">The prescriptive texts containing the instructions for the Tabernacle (Exodus 25–31) concluded with a passage about the Sabbath (31:12–17); the descriptive texts now begin with a somewhat briefer passage on the same subject. The prominence of the day of rest after six days of labor, a contrast to the intensity of the work on the Tabernacle, may relate to the importance of the Sabbath as part of Israelite identity at the time—during or after the exile—when these texts were being collected and redacted. (For the prescriptive text earlier in Exodus that parallels this descriptive section, see 31:12–17.)
</div><b>Moses.</b> It is fitting that Moses’ name appears at the beginning of <i>Vayak’heil,</i> for he is mentioned often in this parashah and the next, whereas Aaron’s name appears infrequently in these last two <i>parashot</i> of Exodus. Here, Mosaic (that is, prophetic) leadership dominates rather than priestly leadership.<br></br><i><b>the whole Israelite community.</b></i> The word for community <i>(edah)</i> sometimes refers narrowly to adult males or to officers (as in Numbers 1:2; 27:21); in other instances the term signifies the entire people (see at Exodus 12:3). That the broader sense operates here is indicated by the fact that the Sabbath observance, about which Moses is to speak, includes everyone. Furthermore, when the “whole community” is enjoined to bring materials in v. 4, both women and men explicitly do so (vv. 20, 22). Although (male) priests largely will carry out the cultic activities (see <i>T’tzaveh,</i> Another View), the sacred shrine itself will belong to the entire community; and the resultant presence of God will benefit everyone.<br></br><i><b>things.</b></i> Heb. <i>d’varim,</i> which is the same term used for the stipulations (“words”) of the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”; see 20:1 and 34:1). Thus, the Sabbath and Tabernacle directives that follow are conceptually linked to the most significant of all divine commands, the Decalogue, as emblematic of the covenant between God and Israel.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:4"><div class="head2" id="exo_35.4-29">DONATIONS FOR THE TABERNACLE (35:4–29)<br></br>This unit, which elicits the donation of materials for the Tabernacle, is longer and also more systematic than the parallel prescriptive passage in 25:1–9. It specifies not only the materials that are to be collected but also the purposes for which they are to be used. It anticipates the somewhat fuller listing that comes at the completion of the project (39:33–43; compare 31:7–11).
</div><b>whole community of Israelites…יהוה has commanded.</b> The language here again indicates that both women and men are included, and it underscores God’s role in this project.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:5"><b>heart is so moved.</b> when the root <i>n-d-b</i> (“to be willing, be moved”) is used with “heart,” it treats the heart as the source of human motivation. In biblical antiquity, people believed the heart to be the identity or essence of a person (see also at 28:29).<br></br><b>for יהוה.</b> The notion that the gifts are for God, which appears twice in this verse and again in v. 24, emphasizes the purpose for which they will be used, namely, to construct God’s dwelling place.<br></br><i><b>gold, silver, and copper.</b></i> These three metals will be used for the components of the Tabernacle according to their proximity to the Holy of Holies. The most sacred objects will be made of gold.<br></br><i><b>copper.</b></i> The Hebrew term also designates bronze (a copper-based alloy), which, given its strength and hardness, is more likely the intended meaning with regard to the Tabernacle.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:6"><b>blue, purple, and crimson yarns.</b> These were the most desirable and expensive yarns in ancient Israel and the wider Near East. (On the manufacture of these yarns and on women’s role in this process, see at 25:4; at 35:25–26; <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View; <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View.)</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:7"><b>dolphin.</b> This meaning of this Hebrew term is uncertain; perhaps it represents a specific color—probably rust—of tanned and dyed sheep-or goat-skin, rather than a sea animal.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:8"><b>oil.</b> Along with its many other vital uses in daily life, olive oil served as a clean-burning lamp fuel, and it was used to consecrate objects and individuals (see at 29:7). Like blood and water, oil was a liquid associated with transformation and holiness. The preparation of olive oil—at least in village settings in the Land of Israel—was likely a women’s task. See further at 27:20.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:9"><b>lapis lazuli.</b> More likely onyx or possibly carnelian.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:10"><b>skilled.</b> Although the commissioning of the artisans does not appear until the end of this parashah, their work is anticipated here. The word “skilled” translates the expression <i>chacham lev</i> (literally “wisdom of heart”), a phrase that treats the heart as the source of technical expertise and of wisdom more generally (compare at v. 5).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:11"><b>Tabernacle, its tent and its covering.</b> The term Tabernacle (“dwelling”; see at 25:8 and 9) here has two components: the tent and its coverings.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="35:12–15" ref="35:12"> The internal furnishings—the ark, table, lampstand, and altar—are listed in the same order as in Exodus 25, with the exception of the gilded incense altar, which in the prescriptive texts is not mentioned until 30:1–10.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:19"><b>service vestments.</b> Even though the ceremonial priestly garments are not structural items, they are appended to the list of its components because they are considered part of the shrine.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:20"><b>whole community.</b> As in vv. 1 and 4, this phrase includes women and men. Here, this designation for the people introduces the response to the call for contributions.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:21"><b>everyone.</b> Heb. <i>ish,</i> which sometimes means “man” but here is used generically, as is confirmed in 35:22, 29, and 36:6.<br></br><i><b>who excelled in ability.</b></i> The Hebrew expression (literally “whose heart was lifted”) is similar to “skilled” (literally “wise of heart”) in v. 10.<br></br><i><b>spirit.</b></i> Heb. <i>ruach,</i> which refers to the vitalizing force given by God, the “divine spirit” mentioned in 31:3 and 35:31—and manifest in human mental abilities, talents, and emotions.<br></br><i><b>Tent of Meeting.</b></i> The term <i>ohel mo’ed</i> is an alternate, perhaps more ancient, name for the tent shrine usually called the Tabernacle (see at 27:21 and at 33:7–11).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:22"><b>Men and women.</b> The plural Hebrew word for “women” (<i>nashim</i>) appears rarely in Exodus, only six times: in 1:19 in reference to Egyptian women giving birth; in 15:20 to denote the women who performed with Miriam after crossing the sea; in 22:23 (translated “wives”) to indicate those who will become widows if their husbands disobey God; in 32:2 to signify the female donors of gold used to make the Golden Calf; here, to designate the female contributors of materials for the Tabernacle (note the singular used in 35:29 and 36:6); and in 35:26 to point out female artisans. More often, women are subsumed under collective “masculine” terminology that is employed inclusively, such as <i>ish</i> (in this book often translated generically as “everyone,” as in vv. 21, 23, 24) and <i>b’nei yisrael</i> (“Israelites”—literally “sons of Israel”). Nevertheless, female terms sometimes are essential, as is the case here because of the gender-specific ownership of the costly items to be donated. That is, women owned valuables and could make decisions, independently of their husbands or fathers, about using them as donations (see also at 25:2). The English translation “men and women” obscures the Hebrew (<i>ha-anashim <u>al</u> ha-nashim</i>), which seems to say that the men came “in addition to” the women, perhaps indicating primacy of women as donors.<br></br><i><b>whose hearts moved them.</b></i> The narrative underscores that women were motivated to contribute their resources to this sacred endeavor (see at 35:5).<br></br><i><b>elevation offering.</b></i> Heb. <i>t’nufah,</i> which denotes food offerings in 29:24–27, refers to a special sanctification ritual employed when dedicating something to God. Here, it indicates the special status of the objects to be used for God’s dwelling.<br></br><i><b>brooches, earrings, rings, and pendants.</b></i> Textual and archeological evidence shows that men as well as women wore various kinds of jewelry in the ancient world. The impulse for self-decoration transcended gender, whether to connote status, to offer protection (because shiny jewelry was believed to keep harmful spirits at bay), to indicate a social or political position, to function in economic transactions, or to indicate piety. Note that in 3:22 both sons and daughters wear the precious metal objects taken from the Egyptians.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="35:23–24" ref="35:23"><b>possessed… possessed.</b> The verb (<i>m-tz-a,</i> “to find”) is used here in a passive form to indicate something that “is found” in a given place or with a given person. As shown by the way this verb is used in the legal prescriptions of Exodus (such as 21:16; 22:3), it indicates possession and is tantamount to ownership. Thus, women and men each owned and had the right to dispose of the items listed here.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:25"> This verse and the next one confirm the vital role of women in textile production in the ancient world, a fact confirmed by archeological evidence (see <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View; <i>P’kudei,</i> Another View).<br></br><i><b>skilled women.</b></i> Literally, “every women [with] wisdom of the heart,” thus indicating technological know-how, as in v. 10. Like other female professionals in ancient Israel (such as midwives and musicians), women who were experts in textile production made important contributions to community life and would have experienced the respect of others for their work and concomitant self-esteem.<br></br><i><b>spun with their own hands…spun.</b></i> The word for “spin” occurs in the Bible only here and in the next verse, although references to spindles are found in Proverbs 31:19 and elsewhere. Plant and animal fibers, usually no more than a few inches long, cannot be used directly to make textiles; they must first be twisted tightly, by spinning them on a wooden stick (spindle), to form string or yarn. Spinning techniques, developed and carried out almost exclusively by women, were highly developed in ancient Israel and the wider Near East. Because it is such a time-consuming task, women typically gathered together to spin; such gender-specific group activities likely contributed to female bonding and networks. Proverbs 31 presents an idealized but accurate depiction of an adult women <i>(eishet chayil)</i> in a settled community who produces textiles for domestic use and market.<br></br><i><b>with their own hands.</b></i> Spinning requires the use of both hands—one to hold the spindle and the other to feed fibers onto it—and even then it is difficult to maintain the separate actions of each hand.<br></br><i><b>brought…linen.</b></i> The text is elliptical, in that it has mentioned spinning and now specifies the colored woolen and the linen fabrics; it omits the elaborate dying process required to produce the colored yarns. (For more details on this process, see <i>T’rumah,</i> Another View.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:26"><b>excelled</b> As in v. 21, a higher level of expertise is indicated for the female spinners.<br></br><i><b>spun the goats’ hair.</b></i> Extra skill was needed for spinning goats’ hair, perhaps because the hairs tend to be shorter than those of sheep and thus more difficult to pull onto a spindle.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:27"><b>chieftains.</b> The term for these officials <i>(nasi</i> in the singular) is used throughout the priestly literature of the Torah to designate tribal leaders (as in Numbers 1:16). As in any society with different socio-political ranks, gifts and tribute collected by leaders make them more affluent and thus able to provide the costly gemstones mentioned in this verse.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:28"><b>spices and oil.</b> These substances for different parts of the ritual are mentioned together here. Although the chieftains bring these items, they likely were prepared by women, who were typically the “perfumers” in ancient Israel (see I Samuel 8:13). Women’s skills in food preparation probably suited them to be the keepers of the special formulas used to produce aromatic substances and fine oils (but see I Chronicles 9:30).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:29"><b>men and women.</b> This summary of the donation of materials again emphasizes that everyone—women as well as men—participated (see at v. 22 and 36:6).<br></br><i><b>freewill offering.</b></i> Heb. <i>n’davah,</i> which refers to private and voluntary offerings to God. Although Moses has called for contributions, the gifts are considered voluntary.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:32"><div class="head2" id="exo_35.30-36.7">APPOINTMENT OF ARTISANS (35:30–36:7)<br></br>With an abundance of materials in hand, the commissioning of the artisans is the last step before the actual construction of the Tabernacle can begin. The designation of these workers, given to Moses prescriptively in 31:1–11, is now announced to the community; and the materials are handed over to the artisans so that they can begin their task.
</div><b>inspiring him.</b> The Hebrew here consists of a verb-noun pair from the root <i>ch-sh-b</i> (“to think”), thus emphasizing the creativity and brilliance of Bezalel’s designs, artisanship, and leadership.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:34"><b>give directions.</b> Although the translation says “directions,” the term generally means basic instruction, which is relevant here. The other workers will owe their artisanship to the teaching abilities of Bezalel and perhaps to those of Bezalel’s second-in-command, Oholiab (36:1), who are not only skilled artisans themselves but also skilled teachers.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="35:35"><b>as workers in all crafts and as makers of designs.</b> This phrase divides the procedures into execution and planning. Four procedures have been mentioned: carving, designing, embroidering, and weaving.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="36:1"><b>all the skilled persons.</b> Literally, “every <i>ish</i> [with] wisdom of heart.” The word <i>ish</i> sometimes means “man” but is often used generically when it refers to a category of persons (see at 35:21), as it does here. Because of the mention of “the weaver” in the previous verse, and because the quality of being “wise of heart” was associated specifically with women in 35:25, the present translation presumes that women were among the artisans discussed here.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="36:2"><b>Moses then called.</b> God has proclaimed who the artisans will be and has given them the requisite abilities, but it is up to Moses to assemble them.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="36:3"><b>continued to bring.</b> Contributions arrive even after construction begins. It seems likely that they are going directly to the artisans, for the builders need to make Moses aware of this over-abundance.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="36:6"><b>proclamation.</b> Only an official decree from Moses can stop the flow of donations.<br></br><i><b>“no man or woman.”</b></i> Instead of using a generic term for those receiving the injunction to cease bringing materials, for the third time the genders are mentioned separately, probably because of the prominence of women in contributing items for the Tabernacle (see also at 35:22, 29).<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="36:8"><div class="head2a"><i>Building the Tabernacle Structure as a Place of God</i> (36:8–38)
</div><div class="tab-en">With materials and artisans assembled, construction work can begin. The narrative proceeds in a fashion that makes sense technologically: here, the components for the structure are fabricated before its furnishings are crafted, whereas in the earlier, prescriptive texts the furnishings come first. However, the internal order of this unit is the same as in the corresponding unit in Exodus 26: first the coverings (36:8–19), then the frames (36:20–34), and finally the textile partitions (36:35–38).
</div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.8-19">COVERINGS (36:8–19)
</div><div class="tab-enin">The Tabernacle is a tent. Its major components are two layers of woven textiles (one of a linen-wool mix, the other of goats’ hair) covered by two layers (one of ram skins, the other of “dolphin” skins). The various fastening devices are also enumerated. (See further at the prescriptive text that parallels this descriptive section, 26:1–14. On women’s roles as textile artisans, see at 35:25.)

The furnishings are made in the order for which instructions have been given in Exodus 25: first the Ark and its cover, followed by the offering table, and then the menorah. However, this unit differs from the prescriptive texts in that it includes the golden incense altar, which is to be placed between the table and the menorah, and also the oil and incense.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.1-9" ref="37:1">ARK AND ITS COVER (37:1–9)<div class="tab-enin">The first item, the Ark, is the holiest. It will be placed in the most sacred space in the Tabernacle—the Holy of Holies—and it will serve as the repository for the covenant document, referred to as the “tablets of the Pact” (31:18). For a people generally reluctant to use anthropomorphic images of a deity, the Ark serves as a symbol of God’s presence. The Ark and its cover (<i>kaporet</i>) also seem to represent a footrest for the invisible God enthroned above it. (See further at the prescriptive text that parallels this descriptive section, 25:10–22.)
</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.10-24" ref="37:10">TABLE AND MENORAH (37:10–24)<div class="tab-enin">The table and the lampstand are to be placed in the second most holy zone, the main room of the tent shrine, along with the incense altar. These items provide two essential needs of a residence: food and drink, and light. (See further at the prescriptive text that parallels this descriptive section, 25:23–40.)
</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.25-28" ref="37:25">INCENSE ALTAR (37:25–28)<div class="tab-enin">Incense altars were standard items in shrines in the ancient Near East, just as some mechanism for freshening the air was part of every household.

</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv-29" ref="37:29">ANOINTING OIL AND INCENSE (37:29)<div class="tab-enin">The section on the furnishings concludes with a single verse concerning two of the substances to be used in the Tabernacle: the anointing oil and the incense. Perhaps the anointing oil is paired with the incense because the two items are similarly associated in the prescriptive text of 30:22–38 and because anointing oil is blended with aromatic substances similar to those used in compounding incense. (See further at 30:22–28.) How the anointing oil is to be used is described in 40:9–15 (see also at 27:20–21); and the burning of incense is mentioned in 40:27 (see also at 30:7).

</div><div class="tab-en">With the components of the tent prepared and the furnishings constructed, the narrative now turns to the one remaining part of the sacred precinct, the courtyard. Like most households and palaces in the ancient Near East, the Tabernacle is to have an unroofed outdoor space, a courtyard. whereas the other parts of the Tabernacle were reserved for the priests, the courtyard was a place where the rest of the people, including women, could enter and offer sacrifices.
</div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.1-8">ALTAR AND LAVER (38:1–8)
</div><div class="tab-enin">The altar and laver are to be placed in the courtyard, the third and least holy zone of the Tabernacle. (For the parallel prescriptive texts earlier in Exodus, see 27:1–8 and 30:17–21.)
</div><b>altar for burnt offering.</b> The horned altar is made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze. It is described in 27:1 as being about 7½ feet (more than 2 meters) square and 4½ feet (almost 1½ meters) high. Such a massive wooden altar, even one covered with metal, is unlikely to have been functional; it is possible that altars familiar from a later period have been retrojected onto the image of the Tabernacle altar.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="38:8"><b>laver.</b> Placed between the altar and the entrance to the tent, the bronze (“copper”) laver would be filled with water so that priests entering the tent or serving at the altar could perform the purifying and protective measure of washing their hands and feet.<br></br><i><b>mirrors.</b></i> Handheld mirrors made of highly polished metal such as copper were highly valued in the biblical world. That these women owned them indicates they were persons of means.<br></br><i><b>women who performed tasks.</b></i> The word “women” does not actually appear in the Hebrew, for these English words translate <i>ha-tzovot asher tzavu,</i> meaning “those who were doing service.” Because <i>tzovot</i> is grammatically feminine, these persons—sometimes called “servitors” or “women who serve”—are clearly female. (The word “women” actually appears in a similar passage in I Samuel 2:22.) The unusual Hebrew phrase, using a root that otherwise indicates military service, is used in a Tabernacle context both here and for the work of some (male) Levites in Numbers 4. The term seems to indicate the work of a support staff (rather than of officiating priests) that performed menial labor to maintain the sanctuary. This verse thus challenges the prevailing assumption that only men worked in the tent shrine. Moreover, the fact that these women are mentioned in an aside in relation to their mirrors, rather than in a listing of Tabernacle jobs, raises the possibility that there were other female workers in the sacred complex.<br></br><i><b>at the entrance.</b></i> The fact that the narrator felt the need to identify these women on the basis of where they did their job suggests that there may have been other women working elsewhere in the holy precinct. This particular location, most likely in front of the tent and visible to the community, was an important part of the sacred space; certain rituals are carried out there (see, for instance, 29:4, 32, 42), and it is where the pillar of cloud rests when Moses enters the tent to meet with God (33:9–10). This location, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, was not off-limits to women (see Numbers 27:1–2).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.9-20" ref="38:9">ENCLOSURE (38:9–20)<br></br>This parashah concludes with the fabrication of the enclosure, made of fabric panels attached to wooden posts set into metal bases, that surrounds the Tabernacle courtyard and serves as the boundary between the holy space within and the profane space outside.

Some scholars think that the Tabernacle is a completely mythic structure whose description is based on the Temple constructed early in the 1st millennium <small>B.C.E.</small> These scholars argue that the Tabernacle tradition evolved to justify and provide a pedigree for the Temple. Other scholars argue that there existed a portable Tabernacle that pre-dated the Temple. Although it would not have been as elaborate as the Tabernacle described in the Torah, this structure must have formed the basis for the portable divine dwelling recounted in Exodus 25–40.
</div><div class="tab-enin">While it is currently impossible to determine the historicity of the Tabernacle texts, it is clear that within the Bible, the Tabernacle and the Temple provide two models of sacred space. The Temple model was particularly resonant when Israel/Judea was a sovereign kingdom (10th-6th centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>). The Temple was a symbol of God’s sanction of the Davidic monarchy, and it functioned as a key element in the Judean monarchy’s attempts to centralize national and religious authority (II Samuel 7:11–16; I Kings 8; 12:26–27).
</div><div class="tab-enin">The Tabernacle model was particularly resonant in the absence of Judean—and later, Jewish—sovereignty (after the Babylonian conquest in 587 <small>B.C.E.</small>). According to the Tabernacle model, God is manifest in the community no matter where the community resides. In order to come into contact with God, the people do not need to make pilgrimages to a fixed location. Instead, they need only maintain a set of behaviors that will allow God to reside in their midst no matter where they are. According to the Rabbis, when the Jews went into exile, God’s presence <i>(Shechinah)</i> went with them and continues to manifest itself wherever Jews pray or study Torah. The medieval Kabbalists understood the <i>Shechinah</i> to be a feminine aspect of God. The idea of the <i>Shechinah</i> as an immanent and feminine divine presence has been a source of reflection and inspiration for feminist theologians like Judith Plaskow and Lynn Gottlieb.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano22-2"><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>Men and women…came bringing…gold objects of all kinds</b></i> (35:22). Because the Hebrew wording is unusual, literally “the men on [or: over] the women came…,” many medieval commentators understood it as referring to relations between men and women. Rashi and Ibn Ezra understood the passage simply as “the men came <i>with</i> the women.” Nachmanides explained that the men followed the women’s example and donated jewelry only <i>after</i> the latter had already done so. Chizz’kuni said that the men collected the jewelry from the women in order to then donate it for the building effort. And Sforno interpreted the words to mean that husbands accompanied wives who were bringing gift offerings in order to indicate their approval. (Two other verses in this parashah, 35:25 and 38:8, also mention women bringing gifts for the building of the Tabernacle.)
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>all the skilled women spun with their own hands</b></i> (35:25). “Skilled” in this verse is literally “wise-hearted.” This beautiful tribute to the work of women’s hands provides the proof text for Rabbi Eliezer’s infamous statement: “A women’s wisdom is only in (connection with) the spindle” (BT <i>Yoma</i> 66b). Rabbi Eliezer believed that women were unfit for Torah study, declaring that “anyone who teaches his daughter Torah, it is as if he taught her <i>tiflut</i> (licentiousness)” (BT <i>Sotah</i> 21b). His opinion expressed the dominant rabbinic attitude which limited Jewish women’s access to traditional Jewish learning for centuries. The sage Ben Azzai expressed the opposite point of view, “A man is obligated to teach his daughter Torah” (BT <i>Sotah</i> 20a); however, this remained a minority view.

</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>He made the laver of copper and its stand of copper, from the mirrors of the women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting</b></i> (38:8). who were these women and what were they doing? Ibn Ezra, Chizz’kuni, and Sforno all agreed that this verse refers to women who had cast away their jewelry in order to devote themselves to God. They came to the Tent of Meeting to pray and hear either “words of the living God” (Sforno), the praises of God pronounced by the priests (Chizz’kuni), or words of <i>mitzvot</i> (commandments) (Ibn Ezra). By donating their mirrors they also renounced personal vanity. Ibn Ezra explained that the reference to their gathering at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting indicated that there was a large group of such women.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Rashi explained the significance of the mirrors through a midrashic tradition, in which Moses first rejected the mirrors, angry that objects associated with vanity and the Evil Inclination would be used in constructing something holy. But God told Moses to accept the mirrors because the Israelite women had used them for a most holy purpose during their enslavement in Egypt: when Pharaoh decreed that the men could not return home from the fields at the end of the day, the women went out to the fields, bringing their husbands hot food and drink. After their husbands had eaten, each women pulled out her mirror and held it up to catch the image of her husband’s face together with her own. “I am more beautiful than you,” she flirted with him. In this way, God explained, the women awakened desire in their exhausted husbands and ensured the Israelites a future generation of children. BT <i>Sotah</i> 11b cites this midrash along with other examples of women’s contributions to Israel’s survival and redemption, stating that it was on account of the righteousness of the women during the generations of slavery that the Israelites were taken out of Egypt.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano22-3"><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYAK’HEIL GIVES US</small> a detailed description of the construction and furnishings of the Tabernacle; in fact, more than most of us wish to hear. Why include this data? why does it matter? It matters because in the ancient world, a temple was a model of the cosmos (Mircea Eliade, <i>The Myth of the Eternal Return,</i> 1954). How the temple is designed and furnished and where objects are positioned express symbolically what its builders believe about the nature of the cosmos. <i>Vayak’heil</i> gives us the specifications for these symbols, but it cannot tell us all that they mean. Symbols and metaphors exist precisely because they point toward what cannot be entirely expressed. Moreover, symbols and rituals are not static. They grow and change along with the people who use them, acquiring new layers of meaning along the way.
</div><div class="tab-enin">As an example, let’s look at a symbolic object from the Tabernacle that we recognize, the <i>Menorah</i> (lampstand). what does it mean? The <i>Menorah’s</i> function is to give light, and light is an important element in our own ritual acts as well. we kindle lights for <i>Shabbat, Havdalah, Yom Tov</i> (holiday), <i>yortsayt</i> (or <i>yahrzeit,</i> memorial occasion). The philosopher Ernst Cassirer says that the creation of light, which begins many creation myths, represents the creation of consciousness (<i>Language and Myth,</i> 1946). Perhaps, when we ritually kindle light, we reenact the dawning of consciousness that enables us both to know God and to be aware of ourselves. Is the <i>Menorah</i> a lamp representing the light-giving or knowledge-giving aspect of the cosmos?
</div><div class="tab-enin">The <i>Menorah</i> is not just any lamp, however. It is a giant lamp of unusual design, so tall that a priest must ascend a ramp to light it. Twice, in 25:31–40 and then in our parashah (37:17–24), the <i>Menorah</i> is painstakingly described: a golden base, a tall shaft, six golden branches issuing from the sides, each branch bearing cups shaped like almond blossoms, detailed with calyx and petals, plus more blossom-cups on the shaft itself. Atop these branches are seven golden lamps.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Clearly the <i>Menorah</i> embodies some kind of metaphor. But metaphor has rules, just like tennis or Scrabble<sup>®</sup>. One rule is that there has to be some link between the <i>tenor</i> (the topic under discussion) and the <i>vehicle</i> (the concrete object to which it is being compared). what, then, is tall, has a <i>kaneh</i> (stem), with <i>kanim</i> (branches) extending from it, and <i>p’rachim</i> (flowers) intermixed with bud-like swellings (<i>kaftorim</i>)? The <i>Menorah</i> is a representation of a flowering almond tree!
</div><div class="tab-enin">The almond tree is distinctive not only in that it blossoms early, but also in that it then rapidly buds leaves, develops new branches, and forms its sustaining fruit—all before the flowers’ calyx drops off (Nogah Hareuveni, <i>Nature in Our Biblical Heritage,</i> 1980, p. 130). Its Hebrew name, <i>shaked,</i> means “the early waker,” and it may symbolize God’s watchfulness or the speed with which God responds (see Jeremiah 1:11). It is also the legitimating emblem of the Aaronite priesthood. At the end of Korah’s rebellion in Numbers 17, Moses deposits the staffs of all the Israelite chieftains in the Tent of Meeting, “and there the staff of Aaron…had sprouted: it had brought forth sprouts, produced blossoms and borne almonds” (17:23).

</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Trees, as well as light, are associated with consciousness for Jews. Our moral consciousness comes from having eaten the fruit of a tree (Genesis 3). The Torah is “a tree of life to all who hold fast to her” (Proverbs 3:18). Trees are elders of the living earth. Their rootedness, endurance, and capacity for renewal is a blessing extended to the righteous: “The righteous shall flourish like the date palm” (Psalm 92:13). The righteous too shall be trees of life.
</div><div class="tab-enin">But the <i>Menorah</i> is yet a different sort of tree, because its branches are crowned with bowls filled with oil that are lit regularly by the priests. who ever heard of a tree perpetually on fire?
</div><div class="block1">He gazed and there was a bush all aflame, yet the bush was not consumed God called to him out of the bush: “Moses! Moses!” He answered, “Here I am.” And [God] said, “Do not come closer! Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground!” (3:2–5).
</div><div class="tab-en">In his book <i>Sinai and Zion</i> (1985), Jon Levenson describes how the religion of Sinai was transformed into the religion of Zion. In the <i>Tanach’s</i> account of the settlement of the Land of Israel, Sinai—the wilderness mountain of the <i>s’neh</i> (thornbush), the site of Israel’s revelation and covenant—was refashioned as Zion, the holy mountain of the Jerusalem temple. The Burning Bush itself was reproduced as a golden tree lit by priests. Levenson speculates that the emblem of the deity of Sinai was some sort of tree. He points out that the blessing in Deuteronomy 33:16 identifies God as <i>shochni s’neh,</i> “the Presence in the Bush.”
</div><div class="tab-enin">The feminist theologian Nelle Morton describes metaphor as an explosive process with a trajectory, like a meteor (<i>The Journey is Home,</i> 1985). The tree on fire that is not consumed—this is an image on an immense journey. The metaphor has traveled from Sinai to Zion, to Exile and beyond, and we have not even begun to exhaust its resonances.
</div><div class="tab-enin">A tree on fire embraces what we misperceive as antitheses: earth and heaven, matter and energy. what we are accustomed to polarize is revealed to us in blazing union. A tree on fire unconsumed proclaims that what is material, temporal, perishable, can sustain what the Christian theologian Rudolf Otto calls the “fearsome and fascinating mystery” of the presence of God (<i>The Idea of the Holy,</i> 1923). If we were only able to see, the whole earth would appear to us like a tree on fire, and we would see a tree on fire in every human frame.
</div><div class="tab-enin">We cannot relive the moment when a startled shepherd sees a terrible and wonderful sight: a tree on fire, unconsumed. we can only make a memory-tree to remind us of that moment, an artifice that we ourselves ceremoniously set afire amidst song and liturgy. The memory tree is a tree of wonder only and not a tree of terror. we take our chances, stubbornly continuing to set our memory-tree on fire—real fire, with all its potential for enlightenment and danger, reproducing the encounter with that fiery presence we seek and yet fear: the revealer of mysteries, the dweller in the bush.
