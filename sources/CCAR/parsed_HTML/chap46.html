<div class="chap1"><small>DEUTERONOMY 7:12–11:25
</small><i>Conditions for Life in the Land
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> E<small>IKEV</small> (“if” or “as a result of”) contains three speeches (7:12–8:20; 9:1–10:22; 11:1–25), all of which highlight the central position of the Promised Land in the relationship between God and Israel. The “good land” is the object of the divine oath to the ancestors (7:12–13; 8:1; 9:5; 11:9) and the goal reached after forty years of wandering in the wilderness (8:1–20). For Israel’s sake, God constantly keeps an eye on the land of “milk and honey,” which is so different from the land of Egypt (11:12).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Whereas the prior parashah presents categorical demands of loyalty and obedience (as in the Decalogue in 5:6–18 and the <i>Sh’ma</i> in 6:4–9), <i>Eikev</i> opens with a conditional clause that emphasizes that obedience brings blessings (“And if you do obey these rules…”). Throughout the parashah, Moses emphasizes that existence in the land is conditioned upon obedience, observance, and love—all of which are manifestations of Israel’s loyalty to God (8:1–20; 11:8–9, 13–25). This message remains central in Jewish life, as 11:21–31 are traditionally recited twice daily as the second paragraph of the <i>Sh’ma</i>, and the same passage is inserted in the mezuzah and in <i>t’fillin.</i>
</div><div class="tab-enin">This parashah mentions women explicitly only a few times. One of the blessings promised if the people follow God’s teachings is the absence of infertile women and men (7:14). A later passage extolling God’s merits mentions that God “upholds the cause of…the widow” (10:18). As divine ruler (see at 10:17), God’s role is to defend and provide for the vulnerable members of society, including widows—a frequent topic of concern in Deuteronomy.

</div><div class="tab-enin">With regard to this parashah’s use of feminine imagery, one verse open to interpretation is the analogy comparing the way God disciplines Israel to the actions of a human parent (8:5). Does the masculine language of this verse refer specifically to a father and son, or, more inclusively, to the way that either parent treats a daughter or son? (See further at 8:5.)

</div><div class="tab-en">The first speech in this parashah binds together two distinct passages. The first (7:12–26) concentrates on God’s loyalty to the covenant and blessings for Israel. The second (8:1–20) calls Israel to bless God and accentuates the importance of recognition, remembrance, and obedience to God. These two sections are linked through the repetition of the word <i>eikev</i> and of the verb <i>sh-m-a</i> (“obey” or “heed,” literally “hear”) in the unit’s first and last verses, which also frames this unit within a literary structure known as an inclusio. In 7:12, <i>eikev tishm’un</i> (“if you do obey”) introduces a list of blessings; in 8:20, <i>eikev lo tishm’un</i> (“because you did not heed”) closes the speech with an exhortation about disobedience. Note that these two verses (and the start of the second section, 8:1) speak to the people in the second-person plural, whereas the body of the speech addresses the people overwhelmingly in the singular, thus particularizing its message to each individual.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_7.12-26">BLESSINGS AND POSSESSION OF THE LAND (7:12–26)
</div><div class="tab-enin">Verse 12 presents God’s faithfulness to the covenant as a conditional response to the people’s obedience. God’s kindness manifests itself in the blessings elaborated on in this section, which concern the fertility of people, agricultural products, and animals, as well as political dominance over other peoples (see also 15:6; 26:19; Genesis 12:2–3).
</div><b>faithfully.</b> Heb. <i>chesed.</i> In this verse, <i>chesed</i> and <i>b’rit</i> (covenant) form a hendiadys (a compound expression for one idea), thus demonstrating that God shows kindness through God’s faithfulness to the covenant with the ancestors and to the Sinai covenant. The word <i>chesed,</i> when used for human relationships, connotes an exceptional good deed done by one toward another, usually with the explicit expectation of an equivalent act in return (for example, Genesis 20:13; 21:23; I Samuel 20:8; II Samuel 2:5). God’s deeds of <i>chesed</i> include acts of strength, victory, salvation, justice, righteousness, and mercy. In all these ways, in fulfillment of the covenantal relationship, God intervenes on behalf of individuals and of the people Israel, showing God’s loyalty and loving-kindness. (See at 5:9 for a discussion of how Deuteronomy and other biblical passages use marriage as a metaphor for the covenantal relationship between God and Israel.)<br></br><i><b>fathers.</b></i> Why is <i>avot</i> translated here as “fathers” (also 7:13; 8:1, 18; 9:5) but elsewhere as “ancestors” (8:3, 16; 10:15)? Translator David Stein explains that this term can have either a male-only or an inclusive meaning, depending on context. He argues that in a verse like this, the noun refers specifically to the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), those with whom God formed a covenant in their capacity as (male) heads of their corporate households. It goes without saying that each patriarch represents the entire household, and that God’s covenant applies to all its members—women and men alike (“Methodology,” <i>The Torah: Documentation for the Revised Edition,</i> 2005, p. 6). Elsewhere, as in 8:3, the surrounding context makes the gender-inclusive sense of the term clear.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:13"><b>[God] will favor.</b> Heb. <i>ahav</i> (literally “love”). Usually, the people are commanded to “love” God (as in 6:5; 11:1); but here the verb designates God’s response to Israel (also 4:37; 10:15; 23:6). The composer(s) of Deuteronomy have borrowed this term from the ancient Near Eastern political sphere of suzerain-vassal relationships, applying it to the Israelite theological sphere of the relationship between God and the people. The people illustrate their love through their loyalty as subjects (vassals) to God; and God (like a suzerain or ruler) demonstrates love to the people through benevolent acts of <i>chesed</i> (see at v. 12).<br></br><i><b>issue from the womb.</b></i> Heb. <i>pri beten</i> (literally “fruit of the belly”), an expression that uses agricultural production as a metaphor for children (so also in reference to animal offspring; see 28:4, 51; 30:9). The noun <i>beten</i> alone commonly refers to the womb, and thus to female fertility and motherhood (as in Genesis 25:23–24; 30:2). Yet here, in the context of a list of agricultural products and possessions that in the biblical world were understood to be the economic responsibility of the male head of the household, the phrase “your <i>pri beten”</i> most likely designates his descendants (so also 28:4, 11, 18, 53; 30:9; see Micah 6:7; Psalm 132:11).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:14"><b>no sterile male or female.</b> This stands out as the only reference to male infertility in the Bible, in contrast to the usual focus—female sterility (compare Exodus 23:26). The Bible repeatedly emphasizes the importance of human fertility, as seen in the plights of Sarah (Genesis 11–21), Rachel (Genesis 30), and Hannah (I Samuel 1), all of whom suffer because they are infertile or “barren.” It appears that Ruth’s first husband may be infertile, for they are married for ten years before he dies without having children (Ruth 1:4–5); yet when Ruth marries Boaz, she conceives and bears a son (4:13). (For more on ancient approaches to infertility, see <i>Noach,</i> Another View.)</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="7:17–26" ref="7:17"> This passage elaborates on the three clauses of v. 16 (“You shall destroy…showing them no pity…you shall not worship”). First, vv. 17–21 depict the projected destruction of the Canaanite peoples as a miraculous action, analogous to God’s wondrous acts against the Egyptians. Second, vv. 22–24 assure the Israelites that the occupation will entail a series of military actions in which God will gradually enable the invaders to destroy the local peoples. Third, vv. 25–26 focus on the dangers of personal and cultural-religious connections between Israelites and Canaanites.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:24"><b>you shall obliterate their name.</b> Elimination of the name serves as a repeated curse in the Bible and extra-biblical sources. Since a name constitutes a person’s identity, not having a name signals non-existence. In a national context, obliteration of the name signifies total extinction of the enemy, beyond their physical termination. (See <i>machah shem,</i> “to blot out a name,” in 9:14; 25:19; 29:19; and Psalm 83:5)<br></br><i><b>until you have wiped them out.</b></i> The various verbs used in vv. 20–24 (like “perish,” “dislodge,” “wiped out,” “obliterated”) represent Deuteronomy’s concept of the ban or <i>cherem</i> (see v. 26), signifying the total annihilation of the Canaanite population. This language may reflect rhetoric about Israel’s total possession of the land and not an actual policy or historical fact. Texts such as Judges 1:21–33 and I Kings 9:20–21, along with archeological evidence, indicate that such a ban was never in fact activated. (See also at 2:34; 7:1–5; 12:29–31; 31:16.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="7:25"><b>abhorrent to your God יהוה.</b> Heb. <i>to’evat YHVH,</i> a phrase that occurs repeatedly in Deuteronomy. It uses this expression, or the word <i>to’evah</i> alone, to denote activities that God detests, usually in the religious sphere: idolatry (as here; 13:15; 17:4); certain sacrifices (17:1; 23:19); ritually impure foods (14:3); putting on the apparel of the other sex (22:5); and certain marriages (24:4; compare at Leviticus 18:22). In one instance, Deuteronomy applies the term in the social-moral sphere (namely, falsification of weights and measures, 25:13–16).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="8:2–3 in order to test you…in order to teach you" ref="8:2"><div class="head2" id="deu_8.1-20">CALL TO OBSERVE AND REMEMBER, REMEMBER AND OBSERVE (8:1–20)<br></br>This speech is built on two antonyms: remember (<i>z-ch-r</i>) and forget (<i>sh-ch-ch</i>). Verses 2–10 call upon the people to remember two of God’s major gifts: guiding the people through the hardships of the wilderness (vv. 2–5), and giving them the good land (vv. 7–10). Then, vv. 11–20 warn the people that once they settle in the land, human arrogance and idol worship—the results of forgetting God—will lead to annihilation (see also 6:10–15; 11:13–17; 32:13–18).
</div> This passage presents the hardships in the wilderness not as a punishment (compare Numbers 14:26–38) but as having two other purposes. The first reason was for God to gain definitive knowledge concerning Israel’s faith and behavior under stressful circumstances (see also Exodus 15:25; 16:4); this notion of a trial implies that God is not omniscient (see also Genesis 22:1–12; Deuteronomy 13:4; Judges 2:22; 3:4; Job 1:8–12). The second reason is didactic in nature: having completed the journey, only in retrospect will the people acknowledge that the hunger and the manna signify their dependence on God.<br></br><i><b>ancestors.</b></i> See at 7:12.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:5"><b>householder…son.</b> [Heb. <i>ish…ben.</i> This translation understands the noun <i>ish</i> (traditionally “a man”) as referring to one who represents a group. Here, the group is by default a household, the basic social and economic unit in the ancient Near East; and the head of a household, in turn, was presumably male. Responsible for his corporate household’s continuity, a householder characteristically groomed his heir—that is, his son—to take over his father’s position of responsibility <i>(The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, pp. 385, 402).<br></br>Alternatively, one can translate this verse’s simile in a gender-neutral sense: “as a parent disciplines a child.” The book of Proverbs provides support for a gender-inclusive interpretation of the language in this verse. The role of both parents in educating a child is apparent in Proverbs 1:8, which urges the reader both to obey the father’s <i>musar</i> (discipline) and not to forsake the mother’s <i>torah</i> (instruction). (See also Proverbs 6:20).<br></br>Regardless of whether or not the imagery is read gender inclusively, God’s perceived gender is not at issue. Drawing an analogy from parental discipline, this verse exalts divine chastisement coupled with care and affection (see Proverbs 19:18; 29:17). Compare at Deuteronomy 1:31. —<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="8:7–10" ref="8:7"> In marked contrast to the wilderness (see Numbers 20:5), this passage depicts the Promised Land as a place of plenitude and prosperity—with water, abundant agricultural products, and natural resources. This description displays an elevated style: first, the phrase “good land” frames the passage (an inclusio), occurring at its beginning and end; and second, the symbolically complete number seven appears twice: the key word <i>eretz</i> (land) occurs seven times, and the list of agricultural species includes seven items (v. 8).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:8"><b>wheat and barley, of vines, figs, and pomegranates…olive trees and honey.</b> Deuteronomy elsewhere (as in 7:13) categorizes the land’s produce via a triplet of agricultural staples: <i>dagan</i> (grain), <i>tirosh</i> (juice of the grapevine), and <i>yitzhar</i> (olive oil). The chain of trees in this verse suggests that the last item refers not to bee honey but rather a similar food made from mashed palm-dates (see also at Numbers 13:27).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:16"><b>in order to test you by hardships only to benefit you.</b> In contrast to v. 2, this verse presents the trial as an experience that would ultimately benefit the obedient people (a common theme in wisdom literature, as seen in Psalm 37:37–38).</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="8:17–18" ref="8:17"> Because material success can bring pride and boastfulness, Moses reminds the people that God is the provider of power and success (see also Zechariah 4:6).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="8:19"> The Bible often connects human arrogance to idol worship, since idols are hand-made statues (as in 32:15–16; Isaiah 2:7–22; 44:9–20; Hosea 14:4).<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:3"><div class="head"><i>Principles of Reverence</i>
</div><div class="head1">WHAT DOES GOD DEMAND OF YOU? (9:1–10:22)
</div><div class="tab-en">Focusing on theological and ideological implications of dispossessing the Canaanite peoples, Moses’ second speech repudiates thoughts of superiority—the idea that God gave Israel the land because of their righteousness. On the contrary, the Israelites have already proven their stubborn and rebellious behavior (9:6–24). Only because of Moses, who repeatedly prayed on the people’s behalf (vv. 18, 25), did God forgo their annihilation and allow the journey to resume (10:10–11). In reply to the question “What does your God יהוה demand of you?” (10:12), this speech answers with four principles: reverence, obedience, love, and worship.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_9.1-6">POSSESSION OF THE LAND BY A STIFF-NECKED PEOPLE (9:1–6)
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses emphasizes that while the Canaanites’ forthcoming defeat can be explained as retaliation for their wickedness (see Genesis 15:16), this does not mean that Israel’s victory is due to their own virtues, nor is it a reward for their merits (compare 6:25; 24:13). Instead, God’s loyalty to the oath to the ancestors is what maintains Israel’s title to the land.
</div><b>a devouring fire.</b> This phrase transforms the allusion to the pillar of fire that guides the people during the wilderness wanderings (Exodus 13:21–22; 40:38; compare at Deuteronomy 4:24). This verse depicts God as a Warrior who will lead the people in battle as they conquer the land. (On the warrior metaphor, see further at 32:23; Exodus 14:14, 15:3; and <i>Haazinu,</i> Another View.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:8"><div class="head2" id="deu_9.7-24">RETROSPECTIVE OF WILDERNESS SINS (9:7–24)<br></br>The verbal roots <i>k-tz-f</i> (“to provoke anger”) and <i>m-r-h</i> (“to be defiant”) serve as key words in this section, which recalls five sins that occurred in the wilderness: the Golden Calf incident (Exodus 32) and the sins at Taberah (Numbers 11:1–3), at Massah (Exodus 17:1–7), at Kibroth-hattaavah (Numbers 11:4–34), and at Kadesh-barnea (Numbers 14). This retrospective follows the journey from the establishment of the covenant in Horeb (called Sinai in Deuteronomy) to Kadesh, which designates the arrival at the border of the land (1:2, 19).
</div> The accounts of the Golden Calf episode in Exodus 32 and Deuteronomy 9 both treat the “molten calf” as a case of idol worship rather than as an attempt to create a physical sign of God’s presence (on the nature of the sin, see at Exodus 32:1–6). However, the present retelling shows several differences in comparison to the Exodus version (see below).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:18"><b>I threw myself down before יהוה.</b> Moses recalls three times in which he prayed on behalf of the people for forty days and nights (9:18, 25–29; 10:10–11). In contrast, Exodus mentions only one prayer (32:11–13) and connects the fasting only to the second tablets (34:28). In his prayers on the people’s behalf, Moses establishes a model of the prophet as intercessor between God and the people.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:20"><b>יהוה was angry enough with Aaron to have destroyed him.</b> In Exodus 32, Aaron takes center stage as the major character as well as the major culprit. In contrast, this passage minimizes Aaron’s role to this one verse and focuses instead on God’s anger and Moses’ role as intercessor, this time for Aaron’s benefit.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="9:26–29" ref="9:26"><div class="head2" id="deu_9.25-10.11">REAFFIRMATION THAT ISRAEL IS GOD’S PEOPLE (9:25–10:11)<br></br>In this section, Moses recounts the aftermath of the Golden Calf incident—how God refrained from the express intention to destroy Israel in the wilderness, restored the covenant through the second set of tablets, and continued to lead them to the Promised Land (10:6–11). In contrast to God’s previous destructive intentions (9:11–14), this section reaffirms God’s commitments to the people and recounts the deeds performed to fulfill those promises.
</div> I prayed to יהוה. Moses presents three main reasons to refrain from destroying Israel: God’s own efforts (9:26, 29), God’s people (9:27), and God’s enemies—the Egyptians (9:28).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:27"> In Exodus 32:13, Moses invokes the patriarchs in order to call to mind God’s loyalty to the earlier promises. Here, he likewise mentions Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but for a different purpose: to set up a contrast with their sinful descendants.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="10:5"><b>I deposited the tablets in the ark.</b> In Deuteronomy, the Ark serves as a container to protect the tablets, just as ancient Near Eastern officials deposited political treaties in their cities’ temples. In contrast, Exodus conceives of the Ark as God’s throne, a symbol of God’s presence, as well as a container for the Tablets of the Pact (see at Exodus 25:10–22).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:8"> יהוה set apart the tribe of Levi. Choosing the Levites for certain religious responsibilities is presented as a further consequence of the Golden Calf incident, in recognition of when the men of Levi rallied to Moses’ call and killed 3,000 perpetrators (Exodus 32:26–29). In specifying the roles of the tribe of Levi, Deuteronomy presents an inclusive approach to “the priests, sons of Levi” (21:5; see at 18:1), in contrast to the distinction in priestly texts between the descendants of Aaron, who serve as priests (<i>kohanim</i>), and the other descendants of Levi, who are referred to simply as “Levites” (Numbers 3–4).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="9:11"><b>“Up, resume.”</b> Heb. <i>kum lech,</i> which evokes God’s previous command to Moses following the construction of the calf—<i>kum red,</i> “Hurry, go down” (9:12)—and signals the reconciliation in the relationship between God and Israel.<br></br><i><b>possess the land.</b></i> Moses concludes the retelling of the covenant’s restoration by returning to the main theme of this sermon: the possession of the Promised Land (9:1–6).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="10:16"><div class="head2" id="deu_10.12-22">CALL FOR REVERENCE, OBEDIENCE, LOVE, AND WORSHIP (10:12–22)<br></br>Based on this rebellious history, Moses outlines five principal demands for the people to follow in order to ensure that they thrive once they enter the land: to revere, to walk, to love, to serve, to keep (vv. 12–13). The force of these requirements lies in their inclusive, general character (compare the detailed commandments in Exodus 34:10–26).
</div><b>Cut away, therefore, the thickening about your hearts.</b> Literally, “circumcise the foreskin of your heart.” This expression refers to the metaphoric removal of the emotional blocks that prevent the people from following God’s teachings and that result in their rebellious behavior (see also at 30:6; Leviticus 26:41; Jeremiah 4:4).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="10:17"><b>God supreme and Lord supreme.</b> Literally, “the god of gods, and the lord of lords.” Ancient Near Eastern texts employ these two epithets as royal attributes. Here and elsewhere, Deuteronomy refers to the existence of other deities, in relation to which God proves incomparable in majesty and powers (see also at 4:19–20; 6:4; 32:8). [Calling God the “lord of lords” takes for granted the ancient Near Eastern hierarchies of status and gender, while proclaiming that God’s authority transcends even male authority figures. —<i>Ed</i>]<br></br><i><b>who shows no favor and takes no bribe.</b></i> Verses 17–18 depict God metaphorically as the ideal ruler. The first part of this verse reflects one of the king’s major roles: to be a mighty warrior. This second part refers to the king’s other key function: to be a judge who defends the poor and needy with justice and loving-kindness (as in Psalms 72; 146:5–10).

Based on the memory of this experience, all biblical legal collections empathetically demand the favorable treatment of strangers, including their legal and economic protection (see also Exodus 22:20; 23:9; Leviticus 19:34).<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:5"><div class="head2a"><i>Occupation of the Land as Divine Reward or Punishment</i> (11:1–25)
</div><div class="tab-en">The third speech of <i>Eikev</i> continues Deuteronomy’s characteristic attitude toward time: the notion that historical observations provide central lessons for the present, and critical signs for the future. This sermon concentrates on the future possession and inheritance of the land, promising prosperity as the major reward for obedience, while threatening total annihilation in retaliation for disobedience.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.1-9">PAST LESSONS AS MOTIVATION FOR FUTURE ACTIONS (11:1–9)
</div><div class="tab-enin">In the middle of the demand to obey God’s commandments (v. 1) and the promised reward of possessing and enduring upon the land (vv. 8–9), a long and complicated sentence (vv. 2–7) sets the present wilderness generation apart from their descendants (compare the distinction between the present generation and their ancestors in 5:2–5). The verb <i>raah</i> (“to see” or “to witness”) recurs twice (vv. 2, 7), the first time in conjunction with the verb <i>yada</i> (“to know” or “to experience”), thus demonstrating that the major generational difference resides in the actual, first-hand witnessing of God’s deeds. This cardinal concept of a direct experience of God’s involvement in Israel’s history governs the historical consciousness of Israel, as exemplified by the repeated command to retell the story of the exodus to one’s children (Exodus 12:26–27; 13:14; Deuteronomy 6:20–21), as well as in the historical recitation at the first-fruit ceremony (26:5–10) and the ratification of the covenant on the Plains of Moab (28:69–30:20).
</div> what [God] did for you. Rather, “what [God] did <i>to</i> you.” In the Hebrew, Moses employs the expression “<i>asah l–</i>” four times in this passage; in v. 3, it is translated as “performed…against,” and as “did to” in vv. 4 and 6. Although the Hebrew preposition can have either meaning, here it should be understood in line with the rest of this passage, in which the enumerated divine deeds are all punitive, aimed at the Egyptians (vv. 3–4) and Israelites alike (vv. 5–6).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:10"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.10-21">SPECIAL QUALITIES OF THE LAND AND INCENTIVES TO OBEY GOD (11:10–21)<br></br>In this part of his speech, Moses draws attention to geographical and climatic qualities of the Promised Land, resulting in the marked differences between agriculture in Israel and Egypt. The ability to enjoy the special features of the land will depend on the people’s conduct.
</div><b>watered by your own labors.</b> Literally, “watered by your foot.” With the Nile as its main, year-round water source, Egypt’s agriculture is based on an irrigation system of ditches, canals, and reservoirs constructed to lead the water from the river to the fields. Farmers control the water flow to each field by using the heels of their feet to easily open a channel in the simple dirt ridges of the irrigation system.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:11"> Since Israel depends on seasonal rains, its agriculture differs dramatically from that of Egypt. The water resources are never assured, for the number of rainy days and amount of rain from year to year change rapidly due to fluctuation in the winds and other climate conditions.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:12"> a land which your God יהוה looks after.

What may seem like the land’s disadvantage turns out to be a measure of Israel’s dependence on—and confidence in—God.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:13"><b>If, then, you obey.</b> This passage links the distinctive qualities of the land and its agricultural fertility to the concept of divine reward and retribution. God rewards obedience via timely rain that will assure plenitude of crops and success; God retaliates against disobedience with a lack of rain—and thus with a lack of produce that will result in famine and annihilation.<br></br>Having given these geographical and climatic conditions such theological importance, vv. 13–21 were incorporated by the Rabbis into the daily liturgy as the second paragraph of the <i>Sh’ma,</i> following the <i>V’ahavta</i> (6:5–9). The Rabbis further secured the prominence of this passage by having it placed in the mezuzah and in the <i>t’fillin,</i> along with other passages from the Torah.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:18"><b>sign…symbol.</b> See at Exodus 13:9.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:24"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.22-25">VICTORY AND TERRITORY AS REWARDS FOR OBEDIENCE (11:22–25)<br></br>Obedience and love reoccur at the close of this speech, though in reverse order (v. 22 in comparison to v. 1). This section contains yet another conditional statement, promising that obedience will result in military success, victory, and possession of the land within wide borders (vv. 23–25). The wording underscores the claimed linkage between the demand and its reward through a symmetrical repetition of four phrases designating an entirety (<i>kol</i>): “all this Instruction” and “all God’s ways” in the clause that expresses the condition (v. 22); “all these nations” and “every spot” in the clause that expresses the consequence (vv. 23–24).
</div><b>Every spot on which your foot treads shall be yours.</b> This promise here and in v. 25 reflects an ancient Near Eastern legal practice of establishing ownership of a land by walking through it. This notion gains a theological-ideological content in the biblical concept of the land (see Genesis 13:17; Joshua 1:3–4).<br></br><i><b>from the wilderness to the Lebanon and from the River…to the Western Sea.</b></i> The present description is unique in its four poles. It starts with the earthly regions from south (the Sinai wilderness) to north (Lebanon, as in 1:7; Joshua 1:4), and then proceeds to the water resources from the northeast (the Euphrates) to the southwest extremes (the Mediterranean Sea). This language seems not to designate actual borders of the land, but instead to demonstrate divine promises of political sovereignty (see also at 1:7).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="11:25"><b>as promised.</b> This phrase evokes the promises with which the first and the second speeches of <i>parashat Eikev</i> open (see 7:17–24 and 9:1).<br></br>Although filled with chastisement and threats, along with promises, the Torah portion ends as it began, with an assurance.

In a patriarchal world, the widow, like the fatherless child, lacks a man to defend her rights. According to the Bible, the <i>almanah</i> (widow) functions in an illdefined but usually perilous role, for women are primarily defined by their relationships to men in positions of power, first as daughters and then as wives. When no grandfather, father, or adult son is living, an <i>almanah</i> has no man with authority over her—or responsibility for her. Although an <i>almanah</i> may be independent of male domination, she would probably have difficulty functioning as an autonomous individual in ancient Israel’s kinship-based, agricultural society.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In this context, God appeals to justice: an <i>almanah</i> must be recognized as an independent agent in order to support herself; to do otherwise would be unjust. God seeks redress, not out of sympathy for the “pitiable” widow, but because the woman should rightly be allowed to function on her own authority. (See Numbers 30:10, which holds widows and divorcees solely responsible for their vows, in contrast to young-adult daughters and to wives.)
</div><div class="tab-enin">Deuteronomy is particularly concerned with the <i>almanah</i>; it employs the word eleven times (10:18; 14:29; 16:11, 14; 24:17, 19, 20, 21; 26:12, 13; 27:19), compared to six instances in the rest of the Torah. In Deuteronomy, she is always mentioned with the command that her welfare be guaranteed and protected. Significantly, the masculine form of the word appears only once in the Bible (Jeremiah 51:5), whereas <i>almanah</i> (singular or plural) appears fifty-five times with the sense of “widow.” Several biblical narratives illustrate the problems that widows face and some of the areas where they experience autonomy. Judging by I Samuel 25, wealthy widows probably do well, for there Abigail seems to inherit her husband’s property before she marries David. On the other hand, the story of Ruth and Naomi illustrates the peril of poor widows with no one to advocate or provide for them.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano46-2"><div class="tab-en"> <i><b>who fed you in the wilderness with manna</b></i> (8:16). Here God is portrayed in feminine terms as a provider of food. It is usually women who do the cooking and baking in the Bible, as illustrated by the “Woman of Valor,” who rises early to cook and bake (Proverbs 31:15), and by Sarah, who prepares all manner of food for the visitors (Genesis 18:6–7). The Rabbis record the seven tasks expected of a wife, including grinding grain, baking bread, and cooking food (Mishnah <i>K’tubot</i> 5:5). Women were also expected to perform the accompanying religious rituals, such as separating a portion of dough for the priest (Numbers 15:20; Mishnah <i>Shabbat</i> 2:6).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>As for that sinful thing you had made, the calf, I…ground it thoroughly</b></i> (9:21). In this passage, Moses recounts how he put the Golden Calf to the fire, ground it thoroughly, and threw the dust into the brook. The version in Exodus 32:20 is a bit different, for it describes how Moses burned the calf, ground it into dust, sprinkled the dust on the water, and made the people drink. The latter’s similarity to the <i>sotah</i> ritual in Numbers 5 is obvious. Just as the wife accused of adultery must be tested by drinking a potion, so the Israelites had to drink the dust of the idol for which they abandoned God. This parallel creates the impression, further developed by the biblical prophets, that Israel’s relationship with God was like that of a wife and husband or a pair of lovers. In worshiping an idol, Israel betrayed an intimate partner; therefore, God’s punishment was swift and severe. It is ironic that the Rabbis deduce from the phrase “and all the people took off the gold rings that were in their ears” (Exodus 32:3) that the women refused to hand their rings over to their husbands for inclusion in the Calf. God rewarded the women with a holiday of their own, Rosh Chodesh, the New Moon, a day on which they were to abstain from household chores <i>(Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 45).

</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>upholds the cause of the fatherless and the widow</b></i> (10:18). In the rabbinic period, a principal purpose of the marriage contract (<i>k’tubah</i>) was to provide women with economic sustenance when widowed or divorced. Nevertheless, much like the Bible did, talmudic texts often portray widows as needing protection and financial support (see, for example, BT <i>Gittin</i> 35a).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>If then, you obey the commandments</b></i> (11:13–21). This passage constitutes the second paragraph of the <i>Sh’ma</i> (Mishnah <i>B’rachot</i> 2:2) that is traditionally recited twice daily, together with 6:4–9 <i>(Sh’ma)</i> and Numbers 15:37–41 (on <i>tzitzit).</i> Mishnah <i>B’rachot</i> 3:3 exempts women from the daily obligation to recite the <i>Sh’ma</i> and from donning <i>t’fillin</i> (11:18), but it obligates them to hang a mezuzah on the doorposts of their home (11:20), pray daily, and recite the blessing after meals <i>(Birkat HaMazori).</i> Most of these exemptions and obligations are consistent with the general rules enunciated in Mishnah <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7, that women are exempt from positive time-dependent ritual acts but obligated to all others. Recitation of the <i>Sh’ma</i> and donning <i>t’fillin</i> must be done at specified times of the day, whereas hanging a mezuzah may be done at any time. But women are obligated to prayer at fixed times because the Rabbis consider them better advocates before God than men are (BT <i>B’rachot</i> 20b).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><b><i>loving your God</i> יהוה <i>and serving</i> [<i>God</i>] <i>with all your heart and soul</i></b> (11:13). The Rabbis attach to these words one of their favorite ideas: that one must be engaged in study for its own sake <i>(Torah lishmah).</i> Should people say that they will learn in order to become rich, or to be called “Rabbi,” or to receive a reward in the world-to-come, this verse teaches that such motivations are not acceptable. Instead, one should spend time in the study of Torah for its own sake—out of the love both of learning and of engagement with God’s words (<i>Sifrei D’varim, Eikev</i> 41). Since women were not obligated to study sacred texts, any instance of women engaged in Torah study implies that it was for its own sake. A clear but chilling case of a woman studying Torah can be found in BT <i>Yoma</i> 66b: a woman came before Rabbi Eliezer and asked him a detailed question about the punishments meted out by God for worship of the Golden Calf; but he would not answer her. The reason for his reticence, according to another version of this tale (JT <i>Sotah</i> 3:3, 19a), was that “it is better to burn the words of Torah than turn them over to women.”

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano46-3"><div class="tab-en"> S<small>CRIPTURE DESCENDS</small> to speak to us, using metaphor to reveal the holy. In <i>parashat Eikev,</i> we find references to the “mighty hand and the outstretched arm” by which God liberated the Israelites from Egypt (7:19). When the Torah uses the human body as a code to decipher God, we glimpse through ourselves the presence of the One in whose image we are created. Knowing that God is incorporeal, some find such physical descriptions of God inadequate and turn to the natural world. Thus we may imagine God as a rock (<i>hatzur,</i> as in 32:4), as dew (Hosea 14:6), or as a spring of living water (Jeremiah 17:13). Nevertheless, if we look closely at the corporeal imagery in <i>parashat Eikev,</i> we discover that its imagery hints at the luminous potentiality of our bodies to experience God.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The portion begins, “And if (<i>eikev</i>) you do obey these rules and observe them carefully, your God יהוה will maintain faithfully for you the covenant” (7:12). Why is the term <i>eikev</i> (here translated as “if”) used to introduce the conditional clause, instead of a word more commonly employed for that purpose (such as <i>im</i> or <i>ki</i>)<i>?</i> The unusual language that begins our parashah invites the early medieval commentator Rashi to engage in word play, linking <i>eikev</i> to the noun <i>akeiv</i> (“heel”). Rashi writes that if we heed even minor commandments that are easy to trample over with our heels (in other words, commandments that we are likely to treat lightly), then God will keep the promises given to our ancestors. Read in this manner, the portion opens with a warning about not allowing thick skin to divert us from the path on which we walk toward God. Like Moses who takes off his sandals to experience holiness emanating from the earth, so we too are called to remove all barriers between God and ourselves.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The next verse states, “[God] will favor you and bless you and multiply you—blessing your issue of the (literally: your) womb” (7:13). What is interesting here is that the Hebrew wording is all in the masculine singular. Are men imagined as having wombs, or more darkly, as owning women’s wombs? Perhaps we can generously understand the verse as a suggestion that empathy can allow anyone to feel the blessing of a full womb. We know God first as the Creator, the womb of the world. The organ that nurtures potential life may be found in only half the population, yet the Torah suggests that both men and women celebrate pregnancy and birth.
</div><div class="tab-enin">If we accept this idea, then women can look at a later verse in our parashah that speaks in an unequivocally male metaphor and not feel excluded. Although our translation reads, “Cut away…the thickening about your hearts” (10:16), a more literal translation of this verse is, “Circumcise…the foreskin of your heart.” In other words, remove that which obstructs your heart and keeps you from following God’s teachings; open yourself up to experiencing “the great, the mighty, and the awesome God” (10:17). The foreskin in this expression can be likened to the thick skin on our feet that keeps us from feeling our connection to the Holy most intimately. Women and men alike can have a heart that is tender, loving, and open to the Divine, not just those who have literally been circumcised.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">The metaphor that calls for a naked heart may help us to understand a deeper reason for the mysterious—and frankly disturbing—ritual of <i>b’rit milah</i> (circumcision). Native American and Mayan beliefs align with Kabbalah in understanding the left side of the body as feminine and the right as masculine. Since the heart rests on the left side, circumcising the heart brings feminine energies into play. Would the addition of a circumcised heart bring into a balance the masculine and feminine energies? Perhaps the metaphor found in <i>parashat Eikev</i> hints that the purpose of the ritual is to remind both men and women to keep the heart tender, for this is not only a woman’s quality.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The circumcised heart is not gender specific. All of us are called to bring forth creative and nurturing energy within ourselves and to act with an empathic heart. Some say that the reason girls do not have an equivalent physical ritual to <i>b’rit milah</i> is that they are born circumcised, the implication being that they are born with unveiled hearts. <i>B’rit milah,</i> then, becomes a spiritual catch-up for boys to approach the openhearted potential of girls.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Being a mother of sons, I have trouble with this explanation, yet we know that women walk through the world with circumcised hearts by their very place in many cultures. They reveal themselves because they often have less power and therefore less to lose. When we think of the hardened, calloused heel that feels little under it, experience shows that women do not have the luxury of stepping without looking carefully. Every misstep becomes a reason for others to keep us back; it becomes an accusation of our iniquity or incompetence.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Rabbi David Mark sees <i>b’rit milah</i> in a broadened mythic context when he compares the phallus to the ancient symbol that the Greeks called <i>ouroboros,</i> the mystical snake that rolls through eternity with its tail in its mouth. He asserts that removing the foreskin from the phallus is like when the snake—a symbol of eternal life—sheds its skin. As a result, through the act of <i>b’rit milah,</i> we incorporate God’s promise of eternal life for the Jewish people directly into the male organ of reproduction. When applied to <i>parashat Eikev,</i> this interpretation helps us to see that a circumcised heart, possible for all of us, allows for growth and expansion, and provides a model for sloughing off gratuitous, constraining defenses.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Torah gives us a language that speaks beyond the physical world and gender. Both women and men embody God in their ordinary lived experience. Just as when we are in danger or despair we reach for another person to lift us up, so we understand that God is reaching for us with an outstretched arm to free us from slavery. In our female and male bodies we find God, and in this discovery we know ourselves to be more than physical beings. All of us are called upon to be creative, transparent, and loving before God.
