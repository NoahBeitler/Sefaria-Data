<div class="chap1a"><small>EXODUS
</small><div class="tab-en">F<small>ROM HIGH ATOP</small> Mount Sinai, amidst thunder and lightning, comes a voice: “I יהוה am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage” (Exodus 20:2). The exodus from Egypt and the revelation at Mount Sinai form the heart of the book of Exodus and the foundation of biblical Israel and subsequent Judaism. This book contains some of the most memorable episodes in the Torah, including Moses’ encounter with God at the Burning Bush, the ten signs and wonders (“plagues”) that convince Pharaoh to free the Israelites, the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”), and the Golden Calf.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The English name “Exodus,” which derives from an ancient Greek title meaning “departure from Egypt,” summarizes the dramatic events in the first part of the book. The Hebrew name <i>Sh’mot</i> (“names”), taken from the book’s opening line (“These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob…”), reflects the way in which Exodus continues the story that commenced in Genesis. In this second book of the Torah, the children of Israel/Jacob become the people of Israel. In fulfillment of the promises that God makes to the ancestors in Genesis, the patriarch’s descendants substantially increase in number and eventually begin their journey to the land of Canaan, guided by the teachings transmitted at Sinai.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">Exodus contains four main sections: <i>(1)</i> the story of the enslavement of the Israelites and the liberation from Egypt (1:1–15:21); <i>(2)</i> the narrative of the journey from the shores of the Reed Sea to the wilderness of Sinai (15:22–18:27); <i>(3)</i> the account of Israel’s entry into a covenant with God, including the precepts contained in the Decalogue and the Covenant Collection (19:1–24:18); and <i>(4)</i> detailed instructions for building the portable shrine (called the Tabernacle or Tent of Meeting), its furnishing, and the priestly vestments (25:1–40:38).
</div><div class="tab-en1">Many readers wrestle with the historical veracity of these events; but the book defies facile answers. While there is some evidence that enslavement and exodus were a core authentic experience, none of the names of the pharaohs are recorded (although the names of the midwives Shiphrah and Puah are preserved), no dates are given, and the biblical text does not correlate easily with archeological finds or extra-biblical evidence. The book itself does not focus on historical facts, but on the teachings derived from the episodes recounted. The main concern is how subsequent generations will answer the questions “What do you mean by this rite?” (12:26) and “What lessons can be derived from these narrative details?” (See also <i>Sh’mot,</i> Contemporary Reflection.)
</div><div class="tab-en1">Women play a pivotal role in the Exodus account, especially in <i>parashat Sh’mot,</i> which records the heroic deeds of six women who take action to save Moses and the people Israel: the midwives Shiphrah and Puah (1:15–21), Moses’ mother Jochebed and sister Miriam (2:1–10), Pharaoh’s daughter (2:5–10), and Zipporah, Moses’ wife (2:16–22; 4:24–26). Following the miraculous escape from Egypt, Miriam the prophet leads the women in a celebratory song and dance (15:20–21). (Some scholars consider her the probable author of the Song at the Sea as well; see pp. 386–87, 392.) Women figure prominently in the laws of Exodus and four women are even mentioned in a Levite genealogy (6:14–25).
</div><div class="tab-en1">Yet in other parts of the book, women play a more elusive role. Moses’ command before the revelation at Sinai not to go near a woman (19:15) and the grammatically masculine language of the laws have prompted questions about the extent to which women were included in the covenant between God and Israel, questions explored throughout this <i>Commentary</i> (see, in particular, <i>parashat Yitro).</i> Likewise, the account of the construction of the Tabernacle initially seems to largely exclude women. However, a close reading of the text reveals that women contributed directly to this sacred structure through their donations and their labor.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Thus, in various ways, women take part in the drama of the Exodus and in the people’s striving to maintain a connection and covenant with God.

</div><i>The Birth of a Nation
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> S<small>H’MOT</small> (“names of…”) is both a new beginning and a continuation of the book of Genesis. In that first book, God made a twofold promise to Abraham of progeny and land (12:2–3, 7; 15:1–7, 18–21; 17:1–8). This second book amplifies the passing notice in Genesis (47:27) that part of the promise has been realized: the family of Jacob has “multiplied and increased very greatly” (1:7). Now the Torah turns to the acquisition of the Promised Land, which can begin only with an exodus from Egypt.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Four prominent themes appear in this parashah: the fertility of Israel; the oppression they suffer; God’s decision to intervene; and the role of women in saving the nation. Israel’s oppression is directly linked to Israel’s fertility, for as the family of Jacob grows into the nation of Israel, Pharaoh becomes concerned that Israel will become too numerous and thereby too strong. Although he tries various ways to limit the population increase, he cannot stem Israel’s growth. Thus begins the contest between God and Pharaoh that will play out in the story of the signs and wonders (in English parlance, commonly called “plagues”) in the subsequent Torah portions.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Also intertwined with the theme of fertility is a more pervasive theme in the Bible: women save the nation. This conclusion emerges clearly from the stories of the matriarchs (Genesis 12–35) and the account of Tamar (Genesis 38), as well as in the book of Ruth: women ensure the continuity of the family—and ultimately the nation—through the birth or protection of a son through whom the line will continue. The beginning of Exodus explores this theme in unusual ways, through unnamed Israelite women and the agency of non-Israelite women. The fertile Israelite women increase the strength of the nation, fulfilling God’s promise and threatening the pharaoh. The midwives Shiphrah and Puah disobey Pharaoh’s command to kill the newborn boys. Moses’ mother and sister (whose names are not yet disclosed), and later Pharaoh’s own daughter, ensure that he is rescued and raised for future greatness. Finally, his wife, Zipporah, averts disaster by circumcising her son. Thus, while Moses and Aaron serve as the explicitly chosen instruments of God’s deliverance, these heroic women are nevertheless pivotal in Israel’s eventual salvation.

</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">This parashah also marks a new stage in the national religion. In Genesis, the patriarchs had a personal relationship with God; in Exodus, the Israelites will enter into a communal relationship with the Divine. Previously, God was known to the patriarchs, and known in reference to them, as “the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” (Exodus 3:6, 16; 4:5). Now, as God hears the cries of the Israelites and resolves to rescue them, God’s “official” or personal name, יהוה, will be revealed.

</div><div class="tab-en">Fearful that the Israelites are “too numerous,” the new ruler of Egypt tries several increasingly severe measures to reduce the population; yet his efforts produce the opposite effect.
</div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.1-7">TRANSITION FROM GENESIS: ISRAELITE FERTILITY (1:1–7)
</div><div class="tab-en1">The names of the sons of Israel were listed in Genesis 46, so their repetition here provides a flashback to the descent into Egypt, which in turn becomes the preface to the exodus from Egypt. Exodus 1:6–7 also functions as an epilogue to the Joseph story. These verses introduce, or re-introduce (see Genesis 47:27), the theme of fertility, which dominates the first two units (Exodus 1:1–2:22).
</div><b>These are the names.</b> The identical expression in Genesis 46:8 introduces a list that includes Dinah, Leah, Serah, Zilpah, Rachel, Asenath, and Bilhah (46:15–25). [The list in Genesis also mentioned dozens of men who are not named here, which indicates that the men whose names <i>are</i> repeated here have been given a new role: each of them now represents a whole “house” (clan or tribe) of people—both women and men. —<i>Ed.</i>] Although these women do not appear here, named and unnamed women soon take on a central role in the narrative.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:7"><b>fertile and prolific…multiplied…the land was filled.</b> Heb. <i>paru vayishr’tzu vayirbu…vatimalei ha-aretz,</i> which recalls the proliferation of life at the creation of the universe (Genesis 1:28) and also after the flood (9:1, 7)—particularly the teeming, swarming water creatures and the command to humans to “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (1:28).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:8"><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.8-16">PHARAOH’S RESPONSE: OPPRESSION AND KILLING OF THE BABY BOYS (1:8–16)
</div><b>a new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.</b> This notice indicates more than just the passage of time. Whereas in Joseph’s time the pharaoh welcomed the family of Israel, now they face persecution by this new, unnamed king.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:9"><b>“Israelite people.”</b> Heb. <i>am b’nei yisrael</i>, which points to a significant transition. What in Joseph’s time constituted “the <i>children</i> of Israel,” that is, an extended family or clan, has now become a people. The shift in language marks a new era in Israel’s history.<br></br>(Outside the Bible, the first extant mention of Israel as a people occurs in the Merneptah stele, a monument celebrating an Egyptian victory over various peoples in Canaan, including Israel. The pharaoh Merneptah, successor to Rameses II, ruled Egypt from 1213–1203 <small>B.C.E.</small>)<br></br><i><b>“much too numerous for us”</b></i> Ironically, the king feels threatened by a people who remains a small minority.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:11"><b>forced labor.</b> The Israelites were not forced into domestic slavery. Instead, they were conscripted for corvée labor, which entailed mandatory unpaid labor on large public projects.<br></br><i><b>garrison cities.</b></i> These were not pyramids (royal tombs), a popular misconception.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:14"><b>harsh labor at mortar and bricks.</b> In the ancient Near East, certain types of forced labor, such as building projects, were typically reserved for men. Brickmaking was understood to be men’s work, even as voluntary labor. See also the next comment.<br></br><i><b>made them perform…tasks in the field.</b></i> The biblical text speaks vaguely of “them”; thus it does not clearly indicate whether Israelite women were forced into working as slaves along with Israelite men. Women’s participation may have been understood since historically in ancient Egypt, both women and men performed field work in state fields; and in ancient Israel, too, both genders regularly engaged in farm labor (see Ruth 2:8–9). More likely, it went without saying that the Egyptians drafted only Israelite men for the physical corvée labor.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:15"><b>Hebrew midwives.</b> It is unclear from the wording of the Hebrew whether they are Hebrew women who work as midwives, or Egyptian midwives who serve the Hebrews. If the latter, the midwives are righteous gentiles who fear God (1:17).<br></br><i><b>Shiphrah and…Puah.</b></i> The midwives’ names are Semitic rather than Egyptian in origin. The name Shiphrah comes from the root meaning “to be beautiful” and has been found also in a pre-biblical Egyptian document listing Asiatic slaves. The name Puah is attested in Ugaritic (Canaanite) literature and can be traced to a word for a fragrant blossom that came to mean “young girl.”<br></br>Commentators question how two midwives could have served the entire burgeoning Israelite population. It has been suggested that this account only includes the names of the two midwives who disobeyed Pharaoh. Alternatively, it is possible that the narrator is here mentioning the names of the overseers of two guilds of midwives—or the names of the guilds themselves. Either way, it is significant that while the pharaoh’s name is not mentioned, the names of these two women are preserved.<br></br><i><b>“if it is a boy, kill him.”</b></i> The reason is apparently so they could not become soldiers in an opposing army, which is what worries Pharaoh (see v. 10).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:16"><b>“birthstool.”</b> Literally, “two stones,” referring to a pair of stones that women used for support as they squatted or kneeled during childbirth. (Not surprisingly, a kneeling woman was the Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for childbirth.) This practice allowed for an easier delivery than the contemporary practice of lying down, and gave access to the midwife; she sat facing a kneeling woman in labor, or behind a squatting woman. After the delivery, the midwife would cut the umbilical cord, bathe the baby, rub the child with salt, and wrap it in strips of cloth (see Ezekiel 16:4).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:19"><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.17-22">MIDWIVES’ RESPONSE: OPPOSITION TO PHARAOH (1:17–22)<br></br>Twice it is mentioned that the midwives are God-fearing (vv. 17, 21), which undoubtedly gives them the courage to countermand a direct order from Pharaoh by letting the Hebrew boys live. They cleverly make up the excuse that the Hebrew women delivered their children before the midwives could arrive. (See also, Another View.)
</div><b>“vigorous.”</b> Heb. <i>chayot,</i> which also conveys the sense that the women are like wild animals (<i>chayot)</i> in that they gave birth naturally, without the assistance of a midwife. The midwives’ resistance goes beyond non-cooperation to a direct defiance of Pharaoh through lies. On subterfuge as recourse for both women and men who face abuses of authority, see p. 142.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:21"> [God] established households for the midwives. The midwives are rewarded for their role in helping to increase the Israelite population by having progeny of their own. [Perhaps this notice means to suggest that a lineage was named after each midwife; elsewhere in the Bible, the word <i>batim</i> (“households”) refers not merely to having progeny but to heading a lineage (see Ruth 4:11–12). Some scholars speculate that the biblical text mentions Shiphrah and Puah by name because those were lineage names known to the text’s ancient audience (<i>The Torah: A Modern Commentary</i>, 2005, p. 347). In biblical genealogies, many of the names refer to a town or clan known also from later in Israelite history; occasionally—albeit rarely—the genealogies do mention women’s names in this capacity. —<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:22"><b>“throw.”</b> Heb. <i>tashlichu,</i> which with regard to a child does not mean “to hurl” but “to abandon” (see Genesis 21:15; Ezekiel 16:5). The predictable—but not immediate—result would be the baby boy’s death.<br></br><i><b>“into the Nile.”</b></i> Much as in ancient Greece, where unwanted female babies were left on hillsides, here the males are to be floated in baskets on the water—where they would die out of the sight of their parents, either by sinking into the water or from exposure. | Ironically, Moses will be saved, not killed, by the Nile. Later, a pharaoh will himself be killed with his troops by water in the Sea of Reeds as they pursue the Israelites (14:28).<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:1"><div class="head2a"><i>Moses’ Birth, Upbringing, and Marriage</i> (2:1–22)
</div><div class="tab-en">Heroes in ancient traditions often have auspicious births. The Bible’s typical special birth story involves a child born to a barren mother (Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Samson, Samuel). However, given the emphasis on fertility in the Exodus account, a barren woman motif would be jarring, if not dissonant, so an alternate special birth theme was chosen: the young hero’s abandonment and narrow escape from death. Similar stories were told about Sargon of Akkad (a king who established an empire in southern Mesopotamia) and Romulus and Remus (the founders of Rome). In both the Legend of Sargon and the Moses story, the child is born in secret, abandoned by his natural parents, set in a reed basket, and pulled out of the water by a rescuer. A distinctive feature of Exodus 2 is that the rescuers of the future hero are women.
</div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.1-10">MOSES’ BIRTH: WOMEN RESCUE AND NURTURE MOSES (2:1–10)
</div><div class="tab-en1">Moses’ mother manages to keep his birth a secret for three months, until she is no longer able to hide his existence. She then puts the baby in a basket on the Nile where he is rescued by Pharaoh’s daughter and aided by his sister. The collaboration of these three women ensures that Moses will survive.
</div><b>A certain member of the house of Levi…married a woman of Levi.</b> Moses’ parents remain anonymous in this story. (In 6:20, they are identified as Amram and Jochebed.) His father plays no further role; his mother and sister (see v. 4) take the initiative and do what is needed to protect Moses.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:2"><b>bore.</b> See at Genesis 29:32.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:3"><b>wicker.</b> That is, made from reeds growing along the Nile.<br></br><i><b>basket.</b></i> Heb. <i>teivah,</i> the same word for Noah’s ark (Genesis 6–9), another container designed to save special people from the water.<br></br><i><b>caulked it with bitumen and pitch.</b></i> To make it watertight.

Micah 6:4 mentions her along with Moses and Aaron as having played an equal role in saving Israel. (See also at Numbers 20:1.)<br></br><i><b>stationed herself.</b></i> Here—and when she approaches Pharaoh’s daughter in v. 7—the unnamed sister takes initiative. There is no indication that her mother or father sent her to watch over the baby. Thus this scene highlights Miriam’s audacity and ingenuity.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:6"><b>“Hebrew child.”</b> It is significant that Pharaoh’s daughter realizes that the baby is a Hebrew, because she probably knows about her father’s injunction. If so, her rescue of the child constitutes another case in which a woman bravely defies Pharaoh’s decree. (See also 1:17–22.)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:7"><b>“Shall I go and get you a Hebrew nurse…?”</b> Whereas Moses hesitates later before addressing Pharaoh, his sister displays no reluctance as she now approaches Pharaoh’s daughter and enacts a clever plan to reunite Moses with his mother.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:9"><b>“nurse it for me, and I will pay your wages.”</b> Wet-nurse agreements like this one are attested in ancient Near Eastern documents, corroborating that a wet nurse might act as guardian for the infant during the first few years of its life. Here, the baby’s mother is to be paid for nursing her own child. [In the ancient Near East, adoptive mothers often relied on wet nurses, as did birth mothers—particularly among the urban elite, and not only due to lack of milk or loss of the birth mother. See the mention of Rebekah’s wet nurse in Genesis 24:59 and 35:8 and comments there. Similarly, one Mesopotamian document mentions that a woman had contracted to give her daughter to a team of two other women for wet-nursing; those nurses “received food and clothing for three years” plus a monetary payment (Mayer Gruber, “Breast-Feeding Practices…,” 1989, pp. 74–82). —<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:10"><b>When the child grew up.</b> Extant documents suggest that in Egypt, as elsewhere in the ancient Near East, mothers usually weaned their children at around the age of three.

The narrative characterizes Moses here as heroic; although later known to be humble and modest, he shows leadership qualities from the start.

</div><div class="tab-en1">Moses is first introduced to God through a modest vision of a burning bush—an object just odd enough to catch his attention. At first only curious about this unnatural phenomenon, he only gradually becomes aware that he stands before the divine presence.
</div><b>his father-in-law Jethro.</b> He was called Reuel in 2:18.<br></br><i><b>Horeb.</b></i> Another name for Sinai (see at 18:5).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:11"><div class="head2" id="exo_3.11-4.17">MOSES RESISTS ACCEPTING GOD’S MISSION (3:11–4:17)<br></br>Like some later biblical prophets, Moses is reluctant to accept his prophetic commission, partially out of modesty and partially out of fear of how he will be received and whether he will be successful. Moses raises four objections (3:11, 13; 4:1, 10), each of which God addresses.
</div><b>“Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh…?”</b> When Moses first objects to his prophetic calling, he expresses humility and lack of self-confidence. In response, God assures Moses that God will be with him (v. 12).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:13"><b>“what shall I say to them?”</b> Moses’ second objection concerns what proof to offer to the Israelites that God really sent him. The proof will be the knowledge of God’s name (vv. 14–15), which is connected to the God of the ancestors, a deity already known to the Israelites. In the course of reassuring Moses, God foreshadows the events that will unfold: the people will be freed; they will return to the place where Moses stands now; Pharaoh will only let the Israelites go after God has smitten Egypt; and the Israelites will not leave Egypt empty-handed (vv. 16–22).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:14"><b>“Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh.”</b> God seems to proclaim this enigmatic phrase as a name, although it appears nowhere else in the Bible. Its first and third words derive from the Hebrew root <i>h-y-h</i> (“to be”). Thus, this divine name suggests pure existence, being—a presence that cannot be seen or touched but which is most certainly there. Left in transliteration here, the expression sometimes has been translated as “I Am That/Who I Am” or “I Will Be What I Will Be.” The present verse may be explaining God’s permanent name (see next comment) in terms of this one, as an instructive “folk” etymology—in much the same way that the Bible often portrays mothers as explaining via wordplay the name that she has given her child.</div><div class="tab-en1" id="e3-15" ref="3:15"><b>“יהוה, the God of your ancestors.”</b> God here proposes to be identified by an additional name, the more familiar יהוה (Y-H-V-H, <i>yud-hei-vav-hei</i>). Known in English as the tetragrammaton (from the Greek for “the four consonants”), Jews came to consider the pronunciation of this personal divine name so sacred that it was avoided and has been lost over time. In Jewish tradition, the convention developed in speech to substitute יהוה with <i>Adonai</i> (the Hebrew word meaning “my Lord”) or <i>Hashem</i> (“the name”), an even more indirect substitution. In 1783, Moses Mendelssohn proposed the translation “the Eternal,” which has since become popular in certain Bible translations and religious circles. Meanwhile, modern academic scholars have widely accepted a reconstruction as “Yahweh,” although there is only circumstantial evidence in its favor; many Jews avoid it. Whereas the word “Lord” invokes a masculine image, the divine name revealed in this verse is free of gendered associations (see at Genesis 2:4).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:21"><b>“I will dispose the Egyptians favorably toward this people.”</b> That is, the Egyptians will willingly provide objects of value.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:22"><b>“Each woman.”</b> In these instructions, the women are the ones involved in the transfer of goods; but in 12:35–36, where the event takes place, women are not specifically mentioned. (Compare also 11:2, 3.)<br></br><i><b>“borrow.”</b></i> See at 11:2.<br></br><i><b>“neighbor…lodger.”</b></i> The Hebrew nouns are feminine, which may imply that Egyptian and Israelite women were on good terms, despite the subjugation of the Israelites. The wording of this verse suggests that both peoples lived in close proximity, not in segregated areas as depicted in the Joseph story (Genesis 46:34). Confirmation of this integration can be found later, in the need for the Israelites to mark their doorposts with blood so that their first-born sons will not be killed with those of the Egyptians (12:13; see also at 11:2).<br></br><i><b>“lodger in her house.”</b></i> This phrase is puzzling. Did Israelites have Egyptian servants in their homes? Some commentators suggest that the Israelites had Egyptian slave-women like Hagar (Genesis 16:1) who served as legally recognized concubines and could bear their master legitimate children.<br></br><i><b>“silver and gold, and clothing.”</b></i> That is, objects of value, in fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham that after four hundred years of servitude in a foreign land, God would bring judgment upon the nation they are serving and Israel “shall go out with many possessions” (Genesis 15:13–14).<br></br><i><b>“on your sons and daughters.”</b></i> Evidence from the ancient Near East suggests that men as well as women wore jewelry. Later, women and men will contribute to the Tabernacle their gold and silver jewelry and expensive textiles (35:21–29), presumably goods obtained from the Egyptians.<br></br><i><b>“thus stripping the Egyptians.”</b></i> Many commentators have been troubled by the implication that the Israelites would plunder the Egyptians. Commentators justify the taking of these valuable objects either as just payment for the years of slave labor, or as voluntary gifts from Egyptians who were eager to get rid of the Israelites.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="4:1"><b>“What if they do not believe me?”</b> Moses’ third objection expresses his concern that the Israelites will not believe him. At this point, Moses receives a set of more concrete signs to prove God’s power: the rod that becomes a snake, the leprous hand, and the water that turns to blood.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="4:10"><b>“I have never been good with words.”</b> Moses’ fourth objection reflects his understanding that a prophet’s success depends on his ability to speak, since he must represent God in a convincing manner. Again, God assures Moses about the source of prophetic power, though God also becomes annoyed with Moses’ excuses and appoints Aaron as the official spokesperson (4:11–17).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="4:18"><div class="head2" id="exo_4.18-23">MOSES ACCEPTS GOD’S MISSION (4:18–23)<br></br>Moses asks for his father-in-law’s permission to return to Egypt; yet he does not reveal the immense, divinely appointed task that awaits him.

Later blood will mark the Israelite homes, where the first-born will be spared (12:21–23). In both cases, blood is an apotropaic—warding off death.

Pharaoh’s pronouncement that the Israelite men must henceforth gather their own straw and still meet their quotas of bricks is reminiscent of the earlier pharaoh’s decrees regarding “birth control” (1:16, 22); but here the pronouncement is also calculated to undermine the Israelites’ acceptance of Moses and Aaron. The scene is now set, physically and psychologically, for a contest between the might of Pharaoh and the might of God.
</div> Moses announces to Pharaoh the name of the God of Israel, whom Moses represents, but Pharaoh claims not to know this deity and therefore has no intention of heeding God’s words.

That Pharaoh would now single out males for harsh treatment is predictable, given that it is men (namely, Moses and Aaron, and presumably the elders for whom they are speaking) who openly challenge his authority.

First, the midwives of the Hebrews refuse to follow Pharaoh’s edict to destroy male Hebrew children. As Tikva Frymer-Kensky has noted, when the pharaoh confronts the midwives, they tell him just what he wants to hear (<i>Reading the Women of the Bible</i>, 2002, p. 26). To the ruler worried about a people that “swarms” and fills the land (1:7), Shiphrah and Puah claim that the Hebrew women are <i>chayot</i> (“vigorous”; or, like beasts)—creatures capable of giving birth by themselves, without the civilized intervention of professionals. When he buys their excuse, the incongruous encounter between the king-of-all-Egypt and the midwives-to-the-slaves exposes Pharaoh as a fool.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The next savior is Moses’ mother, who defies Pharaoh by hiding her son and preparing a basket that saves him from death (2:3). When Pharaoh’s own daughter discovers the crying boy among the reeds of the Nile (2:5–6), she recognizes immediately that this must be one of the Hebrew children doomed to death by her father. Moved by empathy and humanity, she too defies the king when she rescues the boy. The baby’s sister then appears, offering to secure a nursemaid, who just happens to be Moses’ own mother (2:7–9). Through this conspiracy of enterprising women who collaborate with each other across ethnic, class, and religious lines, the future leader of the Exodus is spared—and with him the entire people Israel.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The presence of these five women at the opening of this critical Israelite foundation myth is immensely significant. Deeply wise in fundamental, life-sustaining ways, these women understand instinctively that Pharaoh should be disobeyed; and, with initiative, they act on this knowledge. Ultimately, these women’s defiance demeans the male tyrant. Thus, from these women filled with a power rooted in moral reason, an ethical concern for life, and the capacity to empathize, we learn a valuable lesson in political ethics: the very weakest in society can contribute to liberation by judiciously engaging in acts of civil disobedience.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano13-2"><div class="tab-en"><i><b>Shiphrah and…Puah</b></i> (1:15). The Rabbis are worried about unnamed women and intrigued with the Hebrew midwives. They conclude that Shiphrah and Puah are actually designations for Jochebed and Miriam (Midrash <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 78). They explain this via wordplay on the meaning of the names: Shiphrah was associated with Jochebed because she made children beautiful, and Puah was linked with Miriam because she wept over Moses. This conflation of the characters limits the number of women involved in the salvation of Moses and, by association, all Israel.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>And his sister stationed herself</b></i> (2:4). The Rabbis engage in creative midrash, claiming Miriam had prophetic powers. A midrash found in BT <i>Sotah</i> 12a–13a, among other sources, indicates that when Pharaoh decided to kill all Israelite male newborns, the Israelites chose to cease procreating, and Amram—Moses’s destined father—divorced his wife. His daughter Miriam rebuked him and described his decree as harsher than Pharaoh’s, since Amram’s action spelled disaster for females as well as males. Furthermore, Miriam prophesied that a son born to Amram would redeem Israel. Her father listened to her and remarried Jochebed, after which Moses was born. Yet, when they were forced to abandon Moses in the reeds, Amram no longer believed Miriam’s prophecy and reprimanded her. To find out whether she was right, Miriam “stationed herself” to see what would befall her brother.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the Nile</b></i> (2:5). The Rabbis are also interested in naming Pharaoh’s daughter. Using a verse from I Chronicles 4:18 (“These are the sons of Bithiah daughter of Pharaoh”), they identify Bithiah as her name and interpret it as a message from God: “Moses was not your son, yet you called him your son; so too you are not my daughter, yet I call you my daughter” (Bithiah, or <i>bat Yah,</i> means daughter of God) (<i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 1.3). This very positive attitude to this Egyptian woman downplays her foreign background.
</div><div class="tab-en1">In BT <i>Sotah</i> 12b, the Rabbis transform Pharaoh’s daughter into a prophet, claiming that the reason she could tell that the child in the basket was a Hebrew (2:5–6) was because of her unacknowledged prophetic capabilities. Since it is inconceivable to the Rabbis that such insight could be found in a non-Israelite woman, they thus conclude that Pharaoh’s daughter had converted. To reach this conclusion, they interpret “the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the Nile” (2:5) with the words “she went down to wash away her father’s idolatry.” The Rabbis are also interested in presenting Moses’ upbringing as untainted by heathen practices. They remark that a Hebrew wet nurse (ultimately his mother) was sought for Moses after he had turned down all the Egyptian wet nurses, their milk obviously not being kosher. Thus, the Rabbis are more concerned with a differentiation between Jews and Gentiles than the Bible seems to be.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>and</b></i> [<i><b>Reuel</b></i>] <i><b>gave Moses his daughter Zipporah as wife</b></i> (2:21). Interestingly, Zipporah’s foreign background does not seem to have been an issue for the Rabbis. When retelling the story of Moses’ marriage to Zipporah, they make Moses a greater hero than in the Bible. They do so by suggesting that the shepherds from whom Moses saves Zipporah and her sisters had actually threatened to rape them (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 70.11). In this stereotypical, patriarchal manner, they portray the man who is to become her husband as protecting the defenseless woman from sexual danger.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><b>יהוה <i>encountered him and sought to kill him</i></b> (4:24). In order to make sense of this mysterious story, the Rabbis fill in its gaps with the following details: Before encountering God in the desert, Moses had promised his heathen father-in-law to allow his first-born to be raised as a heathen. But God is merciless and will kill Moses unless he goes back on his word. Moses is placed in a difficult situation, which is resolved by Zipporah, who had herself made no such promise to her father. Thus, she is the one who circumcises the child <i>(M’chilta, Yitro</i> 1).
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>Zipporah…cut off her son’s foreskin</b></i> (4:25). This text is about a woman circumcising a child, which in early sources was not a problem (Tosefta <i>Shabbat</i> 15:8); yet for the Rabbis of the Babylonian Talmud it was. In a complicated halachic discussion they maintain that some Jews are not circumcised for medical reasons yet still are considered Jews, while some gentiles (such as Arabs) are circumcised but obviously are not Jews. In this context the Babylonian Talmud disqualifies women as circumcisors. This means that if a woman were to perform circumcision, her action would not be ritually valid. At this point, the Rabbis invoke the memory of Zipporah circumcising her son. To this seeming contradiction they respond with two alternative readings. One suggests that Zipporah only gave instructions and a man who was present performed the circumcision. The other claims that Zipporah took the knife, but that Moses actually circumcised his sons <i>(Avodah Zarah</i> 27a).

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano13-3"><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> S<small>H’MOT SETS THE STAGE</small> for the drama that plays out not only in the rest of the book of Exodus but around tables worldwide as Jewish families gather year in and year out for Passover seders. The Exodus and the experiences connected with it—the slavery of the Israelites, their liberation from Egypt, the covenant at Sinai, and the journey in the wilderness toward the Promised Land—are indelibly stamped on the Jewish collective memory and imagination. North American Jews relish, arguably more than any other holiday, the festival of Passover whose symbolic foods serve as props for retelling the tale of Israelite bondage that ceases with God’s redemptive miracles. The story is fantastic in every sense of the term: fanciful, remarkable, unreal, and superb. The biblical writers are at their best in these passages, crafting a gripping narrative inscribed with timeless ethical imperatives, such as “You shall not wrong nor oppress a stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 22:20), and theological conundrums, like why does God repeatedly harden Pharaoh’s heart—thereby preventing the necessary redemption without plagues befalling Egypt? This story has sustained generations of Jews, from esteemed commentators of yore to today’s questioning sons and daughters with mouths full of matzah and <i>maror</i>. Jews of all stripes rally to the Exodus cry; even those with mere peripheral knowledge of things Jewish resonate to “Let my people go!”
</div><div class="tab-en1">So why is it that the most unbelievable of Jewish stories is that which is most believed in? Why does the Exodus charm and beguile liberal Jews, even Reform Jews, who are products of a movement of leaders who early on dismissed what the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform calls “miraculous narratives” of the Bible as “reflecting the primitive ideas of its own age…”?
</div><div class="tab-en1">Indeed, on one level, the popularity of the Exodus is baffling. One might imagine that its lack of historical veracity would knock it off its pedestal. After all, biblical scholars, whose stock in trade is comparative materials of contemporaneous ancient Near Eastern cultures and archeology, inform us that few of the book’s details can be substantiated by cold, hard facts.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">Take, for example, the matter of dating. Based on chronological indications in the text itself, the Hebrew Bible would have us believe that the Exodus took place in about 1446 <small>B.C.E.</small> One of the mathematical “proofs” for such a claim depends on the following information provided to the biblical reader in various places: Exodus 12:40 claims that the Israelite slavery in Egypt lasted 430 years (a figure that contradicts the prediction of an Egyptian sojourn of 400 years or four generations; Genesis 15:13, 16). I Kings 6:1 states that the Temple was constructed 480 years after the Exodus, during the fourth year of Solomon’s forty-year reign (I Kings 11:42), which scholars date as 966 <small>B.C.E.</small> According to these calculations, the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt between 1876 and 1446 <small>B.C.E.</small> Moreover, if, as the text indicates, the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years before entering the Promised Land, the conquest of Canaan would have begun in approximately 1406 <small>B.C.E.</small>
</div><div class="tab-en1">Besides the fact that the Torah texts do not agree with one another on the length of Israelite enslavement in Egypt, these numbers do not add up against the evidence of extra-biblical sources. In fact, the first clear historical proof of an Israelite presence in Canaan at all is the inscription on the so-called Israel Stele of the pharaoh Merneptah, dating to about 1207 <small>B.C.E.</small> In other words, the biblical claim of a 15th-century Exodus is off by 200 years when compared to the archeological evidence. Moreover, ancient records demonstrate that Egypt controlled Canaan in 1446, a fact that makes an escape from Egypt to Canaan at that time rather unlikely.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Another aspect of the story that troubles modern readers is the purported size of the Exodus. The biblical claim of 600,000 men (Exodus 12:37), which including their families would total nearly 2 million people, is hyperbolic at best. Plus, many of the sites appearing in the detailed itinerary of the Israelites’ route from Egypt to Canaan (see Numbers 33) cannot be verified.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Certainly, scholars like the preeminent Nahum Sarna have argued convincingly that corroborating evidence suggests a “plausible context” for the Exodus story. Many have confidently asserted that a group of people who later became Israel went down to Egypt from Canaan, settled there, and became oppressed as foreigners. At some point, it can be presumed, they were conscripted into labor and oppressed as foreigners. Some of them later escaped and professed to a transcendent experience with a divine being in the desert. Still later, they or their descendants entered Canaan, where, according to Sarna, they were joined by other peoples and became the biblical nation of Israel.
</div><div class="tab-en1">From my perspective as a professor of Jewish history and a Reform rabbi, dismissing the story because it conflicts with historical data misses the point. Holding the Torah to critical standards of historiography is unfair, because it is not intended to be a history book containing scholars’ attempts to re-create an impartial rendering of what occurred in the past. Instead, the Torah is a knitting together of narratives composed to cultivate a particular spiritual and moral point of view. So when God parts the Reed Sea, I can no more expect myself to nod in faithful assent like an open-mouthed child than when reading a book like <i>Harry Potter</i>.
</div><div class="tab-en1">As a non-literalist, non-fundamentalist, liberal, and committed Jew, I ascertain the message behind the medium. To me, the text asserts God’s ability to subvert nature as a means of demonstrating God’s vital interest in the welfare of the Israelites, which extends through time—indeed, I fervently hope, to our own time. To my students’ question, “But is it true?” I respond, “Yes!” and “No!” The Exodus’ visible and venerated place in the Jewish calendar assures that it will be believed in, year in and year out, to our rational consternation and spiritual delight.
