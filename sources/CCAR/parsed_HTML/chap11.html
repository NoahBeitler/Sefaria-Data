   parashat Vayigash
  </i>
  (“he approached”) is when Joseph reveals his true identity to his brothers. This parashah starts with Judah’s emotional plea to let Benjamin return to Jacob in Canaan. The plea revolves around the effect on Jacob of the brothers’ returning without Benjamin. Unable to contain his feelings any longer, Joseph discloses his identity and sends his brothers home to bring his father to Egypt.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The brothers are both sorry and apprehensive about reprisal for what they did to Joseph long ago. But Jacob is happy to learn that Joseph, his elder son by his favorite wife Rachel, is still alive. He and the entire family move to Egypt. Family matters occupy center stage in
  <i>
   parashat Vayigash
  </i>
  as father and sons are reconciled with each other and forgive past behavior. The other brothers seem to set aside jealousies stemming from Jacob’s favoring Rachel and her children.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  On a deeper level, this parashah explores the dynamics of human growth. Robert Alter sums up the issues beautifully:
 </div>
 <div class="noindent-left">
  What is it like, the biblical writers seek to know through their art, to be a human being with a divided consciousness—intermittently loving your brother but hating him even more; resentful or perhaps contemptuous of your father but also capable of the deepest filial regard; stumbling between disastrous ignorance and imperfect knowledge; fiercely asserting your own independence but caught in a tissue of events divinely contrived; outwardly a definite character and inwardly an unstable vortex of greed, ambition, jealousy, lust, piety, courage, compassion, and much more? (
  <i>
   The Art of Biblical Narrative
  </i>
  , 1981, p. 176)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en">
  The parashah, then, presents a study in the human capacity for lasting change. While not mentioned in this parashah, Tamar has been a pivotal figure in Judah’s own growth. Their encounter in
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
   Genesis 38
  </a>
  best accounts for Judah’s new capacity to sympathize with his father.

  Women appear infrequently in this parashah. There are references to women in 44:20, 45:19, and among those who went to Egypt (46:5–27). The list of the descendants of Jacob who traveled to Egypt divides the entire family according to their mothers (46:8–27). Of the daughters of Jacob, only Dinah is mentioned by name (46:15). The total number of offspring of Jacob who traveled with him to Egypt does not count the wives of his sons (46:26).

  Although the translator modifies the concluding mention of love with “[all the more],” the Hebrew can be understood to suggest that Jacob loves

  Judah’s recollection of this filial concern both indicates psychological maturity on his part and foreshadows the unity of father and sons that will finally resolve the tensions that split the family apart in

  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#G38-7">
   38:7–10
  </a>
  ) explains Judah’s newfound sympathy, while his encounter with Tamar (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#G38-12">
   38:12–26

  ) seems to account for his willingness to take responsibility. (See at

  Judah holds himself responsible for Benjamin because he stood surety for him earlier (43:9–10).

  udah’s speech to Joseph has brought the suspense between the brothers to a climax, and it prompts Joseph’s self-revelation to his brothers. Joseph’s statements reveal that he too has undergone a transformation. Joseph’s emotional maturity matches the emotional maturity demonstrated in Judah’s speech on behalf of Benjamin, as well as Judah’s filial concern for Jacob’s well-being.

  The Hebrew root

  The story reaches its climax when Joseph finally discloses his true identity to his brothers. This is the pinnacle of the emotional build-up that has been developing in Joseph. His outburst of emotions and self-revelation stands out as one of the most moving expressions of family ties in the Torah.

  The assurance that God sent Joseph is so important here that it is repeated twice (in vv. 5 and 7). The arc that spans the stories of Joseph and his brothers serves to explain the will of God to bring about good for the people. The story perpetuates the idea that faithfulness results in divine action and ultimate relief for the people. Moreover, it affirms that God works through ordinary human beings to accomplish salvation for the people of Israel, as represented by the family of Jacob and his children. Thus, despite the emphasis on Joseph in
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_37.1-36">
   Genesis 37–50
  </a>
  , the drama really concerns a father and all his sons. The family is only a family when all its members acknowledge their connection and unite to support each other. The travails of this family illustrate the messiness and unpredictability of human emotions. Rather than be angry at his brothers for what they did to him in the past, Joseph is now grateful for their presence in his life.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Moreover, the story establishes the importance of the capacity of human beings to forgive each other. The theme of family unity echoes the theme of God’s unified control of events. By attributing all that has happened to the divine intention to save lives, Joseph provides psychological support for the brothers to rid themselves of guilt over what they had done earlier.

 <div class="tab-en1">

     “So it’s not you who sent me here but the God who made me a father to Pharaoh.”
    </a>

  </i>
  Joseph uses the language of family relations as a way to explain to them his power over and ability to counsel Pharaoh. Although in the ancient Near East people expressed
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  interpersonal and political relationships in household terms, here such usage is poignant because another “father” (Jacob) is so much on the mind of his sons.

  </i>
  The command from Joseph does not mention the women and wives traveling to Egypt with Jacob. This reflects the patrilineal concerns of the story. (See further at 6:10; 10:1.) However, in
  <a href="14_chapter_11.xhtml#ge_45.1-28">
   Genesis 45:19
  </a>
  ;
  <a href="14_chapter_11.xhtml#G46-5">

  (see below) the wives of Jacob’s sons are acknowledged as members of the family of Jacob who went with him to Egypt.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The precise location of Goshen is not known, but it is clear from the context that the name refers to a geographical spot that will be ideal for the extended family and its flocks (46:32–34; 47:6, 11).

  The gestures of Joseph’s kissing his brothers and weeping over them is what gives the brothers confidence finally to respond. This very emotional scene clearly expresses the true fraternal affection felt by the brothers, who seem to have now made peace with the events of the past.

  The gift of clothing should remind the reader—and perhaps Joseph’s brothers themselves—of their earlier jealousy of the special clothing that he had long ago received from their father, a sign of Jacob’s favoritism (37:3–4). Whereas earlier, clothing had divided the brothers against Joseph, here it signifies the reconciliation between them.

  t this juncture—as Jacob sets out on his journey to Egypt—the narrative marks the occasion in two ways. The first is a revelation from God. This is the first reported divine communication to Jacob since the death of his wife Rachel more than twenty years before.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The second way that the text marks this moment’s significance is with a genealogical list of all those who went down to Egypt with Jacob. Until now, Genesis has described the lineage of the patriarchs in what can be called a “vertical” genealogy that traces inheritance from father to one or more sons (11:27; 25:19; 37:2). In contrast, this unit emphasizes a “horizontal” genealogy that acknowledges the family relationship between Jacob and all of his offspring. (Compare Jacob’s adoption and blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh in
  <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#ge_47.28-48.22">
   Genesis 48
  </a>
  .) This shift in how the genealogy is established coincides with the conclusion of the ancestors’ time in Canaan. The rest of the Torah will concern the people of Israel in circumstances outside their Promised Land.

  This is the name that was given to Jacob in 32:29 and 35:10. Jacob/Israel is an example of an eponym—a group’s taking its name from (or: later attributing its name to) an individual. The shift here from Jacob (one man) to Israel (representing the people of God) may be occasioned by the fact that this is the only theophany—direct appearance of God—in the stories of Joseph.

(The text does not censure Joseph for having married outside the kinship group, namely, for having an exogamous marriage.) Asenath is the only wife of the second generation to be named, perhaps a sign of her distinctive importance: Jacob’s eventual adoption of Ephraim and Manasseh (48:5) will make her the mother of two tribes—by proxy, a seventh matriarch. Just as the other sons of Jacob are listed according to their mothers, so too here.

  uring his long years in Egypt and in service to the pharaoh, Joseph has become a master of court diplomacy. These verses bring out the split nature of Joseph’s identity: he is aware of Egyptian court demeanor but also tied to his family of livestock herders. Throughout his time in Egypt, Joseph defies the “macho” stereotype; he uses diplomacy, rather than force, to raise his status in the Egyptian court. This is the characteristic maneuver of a minority people living in a majority culture; one thinks also of the biblical story of Esther and her dealings in the Persian court. However, standing in contrast to Joseph’s subtle maneuvering is the later behavior of Moses, who dramatically cut his youthful ties with Pharaoh’s palace when he “turned this way and that and, seeing no one about, he struck down the Egyptian and he hid him in the sand” (
  <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.1-22">

   HIS PARASHAH DESCRIBES
  </small>
  the successful deliverance of the extended family of Jacob from hunger in Canaan to prosperity in Egypt and the emergence of the tribal arrangement of the nation of Israel out of Jacob’s twelve sons. The circumstances that enable the physical and social survival of the family are described in some detail. The physical survival of the family is made possible by the reconciliation of Joseph and his brothers—which leads to a reunion between Joseph and his father. Yet the family’s renewed solidarity and cohesiveness does not include any of its female members. Thus for example, Dinah, whose rape and rescue by her brothers is described in some detail in
  <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
   Genesis 34
  </a>
  , was omitted from the list of Jacob’s offspring already in
  <i>
   parashat Vayishlach
  </i>
  (35:23–29).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Our parashah, which gives us insight into the emotional state of Jacob, Joseph, and his brothers, offers us no information about the emotional state of Dinah, the only daughter and sister to be explicitly mentioned here (46:15)—and no story of rehabilitation, reconciliation, nor restitution for her. Eliminated from the tribal list—whether by virtue of her gender, her rape, or association with a foreigner—Jacob’s daughter is thereby punished in a way that his sons are not. Note that Joseph has two sons by Asenath, the daughter of the Egyptian priest Potiphera, and is not censored in any way by the narrator.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The detailed genealogical list in our parashah (46:8–27) makes only brief references to Rachel, Leah, Bilhah, and Zilpah—Jacob’s four wives. To be sure, Rachel’s special status is echoed somewhat in 44:20 and 27, and Asher’s daughter Serah is mentioned by name in 46:17, but neither mothers nor daughters appear as significant names in the family or tribal genealogies. (On women in lineages, see also at 6:1, 6:10; 10:1; 17:19; 22:20–24.) Similarly, barely any information is offered at all about Asenath, Joseph’s wife and the mother of Manasseh and Ephraim. Joseph fathers two tribes in the nation of Israel. In other words, women appear in our parashah as relatives of significant fathers, husbands, and sons, or as nameless relatives as in “your wives” (45:19) or “their wives” (46:5).

    “give your servant a hearing”

  (44:18). In the Hebrew, what Judah literally asks is to speak a word in Joseph’s ears. Midrash
  <i>
   B’reishit Rabbah
  </i>
  93.6 understands this locution as implying that Judah was relaying a private caution to Joseph—warning him of violent consequences, both human and divine, if Benjamin were to be enslaved in Egypt. All of the examples Judah uses to back up his threats (according to the Rabbis) refer to episodes of retribution in the lives of female family members—starting with Sarah and Rachel: “Because Pharaoh took Benjamin’s great-grandmother for only one night (12:15), he and his household were afflicted with plagues (12:17).” Moreover, “[Benjamin’s] mother died only because of his father’s curse,
  <i>
   But the one with whom you find your gods shall not live
  </i>
  (31:32). So
  <a id="page_276">
  </a>
  take heed lest he hurl a curse against you—and you die!” Judah goes on to warn Joseph that two of his brothers once entered a large city and destroyed it (
  <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
   Genesis 34
  </a>
  ): “And if they did so much on account of a woman—their sister Dinah—how much the more so would they do when it is on account of a man [namely, their brother Benjamin], the beloved of the eyes, the one who gives hospitality to the blessed Holy One, as is said:
  <i>
   Of Benjamin he said: Beloved of the Eternal, / He rests securely beside [God], / Who protects him always, / [God] dwells amid his slopes
  </i>
  (
  <a href="57_chapter_54.xhtml#deu_33.1-29">
   Deuteronomy 33:12
  </a>
  ).” This valuing of a man over a woman is reflective of the social ordering of human beings in rabbinic literature, where women are seen as a secondary creation, both lesser and other than men. Nevertheless, the Rabbis did not view the women of Israel as nonentities; as each of the examples cited makes clear, their reputations, their words, and their actions were highly valued.

   <b>
    “your servant made himself responsible for the lad.…how can I go home to my father without the lad…?”
   </b>
  </i>
  (44:32–34). The Rabbis very much admired Judah’s loyalty to Benjamin and to the pledge he had made to Jacob. Contrary to the biblical narrative, in which Judah speaks to Joseph with cautious and even obsequious words, the rabbinic sages imagined so mighty a confrontation between “Judah the lion and Joseph the bull” that even the angels descended from heaven to witness the dispute (Midrash
  <i>
   Tanchuma, Vayigash
  </i>
  4, 5).

  (46:7). In
  <i>
   B’reishit Rabbah
  </i>
  94.6, Rabbi Judah bar Ilai noticed that this verse includes both the sons and daughters of Jacob’s sons but not his daughters’ children, and commented: “The daughters of one’s sons are as one’s own children, whereas the sons of one’s daughters are not as one’s own sons.” This statement reflects a frequent situation in ancient times where daughters left their birth families at marriage and became part of their husbands’ households. Thus, their children were less likely to spend time with their maternal grandparents. In rabbinic halachah (that is, legal traditions), a married woman received a dowry from her father’s resources at the time of marriage but did not automatically inherit anything from her father’s estate.

    Asher’s sons…and their sister Serah

  (46:17). This is the first biblical mention of Serah bat Asher. She reappears in
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_25.19-26.65">
   Numbers 26:46
  </a>
  among Asher’s descendants who participated in the Exodus. Some rabbis linked these passages and imagined that Serah’s lifetime spanned not only the four hundred years of Israel’s captivity in Egypt but extended far beyond. Her remarkable longevity is attributed to a powerful blessing of praise that her grandfather Jacob bestowed on her when she informed him in song that Joseph was still alive (
  <i>
   Midrash HaGadol
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   Sefer HaYashar
  </i>
  on 46:8). At the time of the Exodus, Serah showed Moses where Joseph had been buried, so that his coffin might return with the Israelites to the land of Israel (
  <i>
   M’chilta, B’shalach
  </i>
  on 13:19; BT
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  13a). Other rabbis identify Serah with the “wise woman” who negotiated with David’s general Joab in II Samuel 20:16–24, another four hundred years after the Exodus (
  <i>
   B’reishit Rabbah
  </i>
  94.9;
  <i>
   Midrash HaGadol
  </i>
  on
  <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_23.1-20">
   Genesis 23:1
  </a>
  ). In the 13th-century Yemenite compendium
  <i>
   Midrash HaGadol,
  </i>
  Serah is further linked with Proverbs 31:26, “Her mouth is full of wisdom, her tongue with kindly teaching” (on
  <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_23.1-20">
   Genesis 23:1
  </a>
  ). Other medieval sources claim that Serah “did not taste death” but entered Paradise alive (

  20–21).

  in the kingdom of self-help books:
  <i>
   Five Steps to Overcoming Fear and Doubt; Five Steps to Emotional Healing; Five Steps to Spiritual Growth.
  </i>
  Every self-help book is marketed as the “ultimate one,” or even as “the last self-help book you’ll ever need.” Over 300,000 self-help books are on the market. Typically, they promise a neatly outlined plan for self-transformation, for becoming free of a rooted sorrow or of deep-seated fears. They encourage the reader to believe that suffering is not worth the trouble, and gaining self-knowledge a routine affair—easily available for anyone with access to
  <a href="http://amazon.com">

  </a>
  and a credit card.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Thanks to the “self-help” industry, Americans—in particular—flee from mourning. We talk of going through the “grief process” until we experience “closure,” as if we ourselves roll along an assembly line of emotion until we get to the final station: the packaging of our sorrow, the sealing it tight, the storing it away.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  But the very notion of “closure” for grief is an illusion. Instead, there is only the tentative recognition that our anguish is endurable, that—despite ourselves—life goes on and engages us with new emotions, new situations and images, new challenges and changes. The remembrance of the people we miss gets tucked into our hearts to be revisited—perhaps when we least expect it. As for the process of true inner change, true self-transformation, we learn to forgive ourselves for the mistakes of the past by not making them again. If we are lucky, life “tenderizes” the heart, gives us hearts not of stone but of flesh.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  <i>
   Vayigash
  </i>
  powerfully addresses this more authentic model of true emotional change via the character of Judah. In its very opening lines, we find Judah in the midst of responding in an impassioned voice to the demand of the Egyptian vizier that the youngest of Jacob and Rachel’s sons, Benjamin, be left behind in Egypt. Not knowing, of course, that the forbidding vizier is none other than Rachel’s other son, Joseph—whom Judah and his brothers threw into a pit years before—Judah pleads with him to change his mind. Losing Benjamin would break his father’s heart, already broken because he believes his beloved Joseph is dead, says Judah. He begs to be kept behind in Benjamin’s place. And then he speaks the most plaintive words of all: “For how can I go home to my father if the lad is not with me?” (44:34, my translation).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  These words finally break Joseph’s heart—and continue to reverberate through the ages. They signal to Joseph that he can finally trust his brothers, that there has been a profound sea-change in their character, that he can finally reveal himself to them. And so we need to ask ourselves what, in fact, has enabled Judah to come forth in this way? What has enabled the change?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The answer cannot be found in any self-help book. Judah most certainly did not take an instant course in “Five Steps to Become a Mensch.” Instead, we can conclude that Judah is able to stand up to Joseph-the-Vizier’s demand because he himself had gone through a painful, embarrassing experience of growth, one made possible through the courageous and determined intervention of his daughter-in-law Tamar.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Reflecting the Torah’s brilliant narrative strategy, the story of Tamar appears right after the brothers have lied to their father Jacob, trying to make it appear as if Joseph has been killed. Jacob rends his garments, puts on sackcloth, and goes into mourning: “His sons and daughters endeavored to console him, but he refused to be consoled, saying, ‘No, in mourning shall I go down to my son to Sheol!”’ (37:35). No sooner does that happen than there is a break in the story, a seeming excursus: the scene switches to the tale of Tamar.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  “Around that time,” says the text (38:1), Judah marries the daughter of a man named Shua, and she then bears three sons. The oldest, Er, marries Tamar.
  <a id="page_278">
  </a>
  But Er dies, with no indication of an emotional reaction from Judah. Following Israelite law, he sends his second son, Onan, to marry Tamar, but Onan refuses to impregnate her and he, too, dies. The law dictates that the third son, Shelah, should now marry Tamar, but Judah delays fulfilling this law, afraid that Shelah, too, will die. Indeed, he waits so long that Tamar, hearing that he is going to a sheep-shearing, presents herself as a harlot on the road. He “couples” with her, not knowing who she is. When rumor later reaches him that his daughter-in-law is pregnant, he demands that she be taken out and burned. Only when she is brought to him and shows him the signet and staff that he had left with her in lieu of payment, does he realize what has transpired. He then admits: “She is more in the right than I, for certainly I did not give her to my son Shelah” (38:26).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Tamar’s achievement lies in more than insisting that her father-in-law right his wrongdoing. Her act also becomes the galvanizing force that enables him to face, and thus finally overcome, the trauma of losing two of his sons and the paralyzing fear that he would lose his third, just as his own father Jacob had feared sending Benjamin to Egypt because he was the only son of Rachel left (42:38). Through the intervention of Tamar, Judah’s heart is “tenderized” by his recognition of the wrong that his inchoate fear of loss had caused. That is why he is now able to plead for compassion before the seeming might of Egypt.
