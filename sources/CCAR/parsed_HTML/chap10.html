  (“at the end of”) marks the end of Joseph’s time in prison, traces his rise to power in Pharaoh’s court, and concludes when his brothers stand before him fearful for their fate. Earlier, in
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_37.1-36">
   Genesis 37
  </a>
  , Joseph’s dreams had provoked the envy of his brothers. In this parashah, dreams enable him to leave prison when he uses his gifts to interpret Pharaoh’s dreams. Joseph’s own dreams come true when his brothers—not knowing who he is—bow to him in supplication. How will Joseph respond? Have the brothers changed? The parashah concludes with the key question still unanswered:
  <i>
   is this family doomed to relive a violent past, or will it show that transformation and growth are possible?
  </i>
  In this parashah, Judah takes the lead as representative of the brothers. His rise to responsibility can be linked to his encounter with Tamar in
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
   Genesis 38
  </a>
  (see below).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Favoritism in Jacob’s household continues to propel the narrative. Jacob’s undying love for Rachel has led him to favor her sons, Joseph and Benjamin, over those of Leah, Bilhah, and Zilpah—resulting in virulent sibling rivalry for Jacob’s affection (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_37.1-36">
   Genesis 37
  </a>
  ). Years later, the brothers still must cope with Jacob’s blatant favoritism while he remains oblivious to the effect of his behavior.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  In this parashah, women appear mostly indirectly. Unlike Sarah and Rebekah—who actively appeared in the earlier episodes about Abraham, Isaac, and their offspring—Jacob’s wives remain in the background and do not act. Rachel has already died (35:19), and Leah, whose burial is retrospectively recorded later (49:31), goes unmentioned. Nothing further is said about Zilpah or Bilhah. Only Asenath plays a direct role, as Joseph’s Egyptian wife and as mother of his sons. The name of her father, the priest Potiphera, echoes Potiphar’s name—evoking memories of Potiphar’s wife, the cause for Joseph’s incarceration in the previous parashah (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_39.1-23">
   Genesis 39
  </a>
  ).

 <div class="tab-en1">
  At the same time, one notes several allusions or connections with the encounter between Tamar and Judah in
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
   Genesis 38
  </a>
  . For example, in both stories, clothing serves as a disguise, hiding the true identity of Judah’s interlocutor; in both, the same verb (translated as “acknowledge” in
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#G38-25">
   38:25–26
  </a>
  and “recognize” in 42:8) marks a pivotal moment; in both, also, the notion of pledge plays a role (see at 43:9). Possibly, Judah’s rise to prominence in this parashah results from the transformation he had undergone when Tamar quietly called him to account.

  s the parashah opens, Joseph is in Egypt, where he is not only a slave but also indefinitely detained in a prison—and no one in his family knows his whereabouts. For readers the situation would seem grim but for the narrator’s note that “
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
   יהוה
  </span>
  was with Joseph” (39:21). In his youth, Joseph’s dreams had provided the pretext for his enslavement (see
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#G37-19">
   37:19–20
  </a>
  ); now—in a turn of poetic justice—the dreams of others provide the context for solving his problem both of enslavement and of imprisonment: the ruler of Egypt awakens from a pair of disturbing premonitory dreams; upon hearing this, his chief cupbearer recalls how he once received help with his own troubling dream. And this leads back to Joseph.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Although Pharaoh’s dreams strictly relate to famine in Egypt, as the story later unfolds we will see the famine extending to the land where Jacob resides. Thus, the famine will make it possible for Joseph to be reunited with his family.

  Joseph brilliantly interprets dreams that foretell upcoming events of great magnitude. Through his interpretation, we discover that both cows and ears of corn are symbols of food that express the fertility of land. However, in the next parashah, Joseph will be the one to provide nourishment when he is in charge of distributing grain during the famine.

  When Joseph had encountered Potiphar’s wife, he wound up in jail (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_39.1-23">
   Genesis 39

  ); but now, when he encounters Potiphera’s daughter, Joseph becomes fully integrated into Egyptian society. Perhaps the author is subtly contrasting the “evil woman” versus the “good woman” here. Biblical women characters in Genesis are often presented in pairs: Sarah and Hagar, Rachel and Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, and now, Potiphar’s wife and Asenath.

  This, like his new name, indicates Joseph’s acceptance into Egyptian society and a shift in his identity. One may understand Joseph now to be not only an Egyptian, but also a fully adult male (age 30, according to v. 46). Comparative evidence, not only from other ancient Near Eastern cultures but also from anthropological data regarding patrilineally organized societies, makes clear that in the biblical period, a male was not considered a man until he had a wife (if not also children). Similarly, a female in ancient Israel was not fully accepted as a woman until she was married and had borne children to her husband (think of Sarah in
  <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.10-14.24">
   Genesis 12–21

In contrast to Jacob’s sons, whose names bear the hopes and circumstances of their mothers Leah and Rachel (29:31–30:24; 35:18), these sons’ names say nothing about Asenath’s aspirations. Her sons, progenitors of the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, are not only linked to the family of Israel but also are descendants of an Egyptian priestly heritage. Jacob later recognizes both of these sons as full heirs to the Israelite lineage (48:5).

As these ostensibly free family members react to their situation, it reveals to the reader that they are, as it were, trapped in a confinement of their own: the family is constrained by unacknowledged favoritism, betrayal, and guilt. Thus even what might otherwise be greeted with glee—the surprise discovery of money—is received with dismay (vv. 28, 35).

  Jacob may think that the brothers sold Simeon for the money that now appears in their sacks—and that they plan the same fate for Benjamin. Benjamin is Jacob’s youngest son and, as far as Jacob knows, his only surviving son from his beloved wife Rachel, who died in childbirth (35:16–19).

  Jacob’s speech illustrates that he cannot be consoled after losing the sons Rachel bore to him, while the loss of his other sons is acceptable. Note the shifting familial language: Jacob refers to Benjamin as “my son” and then Joseph as “his brother,” relating them both back to his love for the deceased Rachel. Jacob is still oblivious to the alienation that such favoritism causes among the brothers. His response—that only Benjamin remains—denies the other ten brothers any place in their father’s family or feelings. It is as if they do not exist for their father.

  </i>
  Jacob uses a Hebrew idiom for dying due to grief—rather than in a good old age—and descending to the realm of the dead. Earlier, Jacob had said he would go down to Sheol in mourning for the loss of Joseph, presumably to seek out his son there (37:35). Although Sheol is the underworld—a place below the ground—it is not to be equated with notions of Hell or a judgment after death. Such ideas did not exist in ancient Israelite thought; going to Sheol was the fate of all human beings.

However, based on his experience that followed upon his unjust treatment of Tamar (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">

Although the family of Jacob has been torn apart in many respects, specific sons struggle to keep the family intact as best they can.

  The tearing of the clothing reflects the brothers’ concern that Benjamin would be torn from their family. (The custom of tearing one’s clothes as an act of mourning is still followed today.) His fate appears to have been sealed by his brothers’ own words (v. 9). Thus once again they have set up one of Rachel’s offspring to become a slave. Indeed, these brothers had caused their father likewise to tear his garment—more than two decades earlier (37:34).

  he vizier’s missing goblet has been found in Benjamin’s bag (v. 12), suggesting that he stole it. Benjamin stands accused but lacks the ability to prove his innocence. Surely he will be enslaved and remain in Egypt, presumably for the rest of his life. Benjamin’s voice is heard nowhere in the entire narrative. Although he is now at the heart of the story, it is not really about him, but rather about the relationship of his brothers to each other and to their father. (In this regard he resembles his half-sister Dinah in
  <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">

  .)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  At this point the rest of the brothers—having narrowly escaped slavery themselves—are free to return home. Remarkably, they do not do so. Instead, they return with Benjamin to face the vizier (Joseph), who challenges them to account for their deed. Judah replies, and a dialogue ensues.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  At this juncture, the psychological dynamics of these events operate on multiple levels. Thus we may speculate that Judah is haunted by guilt over what the brothers (without Benjamin’s involvement) did to Joseph long ago—and he feels that they must finally pay for their actions (see 42:21). Judah’s remarks can then refer both to the present unfortunate reality of the goblet in Benjamin’s sack and to the brothers’ past behavior toward Joseph.

   HARAOH’S DREAM WAS REPEATED
  </small>
  —two times—because the matter has been fixed by God, and God is making haste to accomplish it” (41:32).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Why are there so many repetitions in the Hebrew Bible—and in the Torah especially? The Bible usually does not spell out its poetic principles, so that readers are obliged to deduce them from the text itself. Scholars since the 19th century have explained repetition in the Bible as due to its editors having drawn from different sources. But in this parashah,
  <a href="13_chapter_10.xhtml#ge_41.1-57">
   Genesis 41:32
  </a>
  uniquely offers what amounts to a poetic statement, explaining the need for narrative repetition.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The reader wonders why Pharaoh dreams twice—first of cows, then of ears of grain. Joseph explains that “Pharaoh’s dream is one: what God is doing, [God] has revealed to Pharaoh” (41:25). Thus the two dreams have a single solution: God is informing Pharaoh that seven years of abundance will be followed by seven years of famine. But if a single dream would have sufficed, why are there two, and why do they follow so closely? Verse 32 explains that repetition right away means that God had decided the matter and would shortly carry it out.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  A close reading reveals that the repetition is not confined to Pharaoh’s dreams but recurs throughout the Joseph story. Joseph himself has two dreams (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#G37-5">
   37:5–9
  </a>
  ), though not close together—meaning that they would not be realized immediately. Moreover, this story cycle’s use of repeated occurrences—not necessarily dreams—justifies characterizing its plot as advancing by paired structures. For example: Joseph escapes being killed by his brothers thanks to two rescue attempts (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#G37-19">
   37:18–30
  </a>
  ); the brothers go to Egypt twice to procure rations (42:1–43:25); Joseph twice acts like a stranger to them and punishes them (42:7–28, 44), and more. We may conclude that repetition does not necessarily indicate a plurality of sources or traditions; it may also represent a poetical principle, a device that indicates a fixed divine intention—and sometimes its imminent actualization. In this manner,
  <i>
   parashat Mikeitz
  </i>
  offers an interpretation of more than Pharaoh’s dreams. It holds a key to the literary and theological use of repetition throughout the Hebrew Bible.

  (41:7). Many ancient Jews used to reflect on a passage from the Torah by juxtaposing it with a passage from the Prophets—called a haftarah—that contains similar themes, turns of phrase, or both. A widely attested haftarah with
  <i>
   parashat Mikeitz
  </i>
  is I Kings 3:15–4:1, which is the norm even today. Royal dreams form one connection between the two biblical passages. The haftarah echoes the parashah verbally by opening with the words “Solomon woke up,” and then it relates that Israel’s new king had been dreaming.

  89.6, the Rabbis explain that Pharaoh’s magicians interpreted his dreams incorrectly. According to the sorcerers, the healthy cows foretold that Pharaoh
  <a id="page_253">

 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  <i>
   <b>
    “as he interpreted for us, so it came to be”

  (41:13). Rabbi Eliezer states that “all dreams follow the mouth”; that is, a dream comes true according to how it is interpreted (BT
  <i>
   B’rachot
  </i>
  55b). As an example,
  <i>
   B’reishit Rabbah
  </i>
  89.8 recounts that a woman came to him and told him of a recurring dream in which her house split open. The first two times she came to the sage, he told her she would give birth to a boy. The third time the rabbi was away; his students told the woman that her husband would die and this immediately came to pass. When the rabbi heard her laments, he accused his students of killing the husband, and cited this verse as his proof. As the anecdote indicates, power rests not in the dream itself, but in the skill, wisdom, and righteousness of the interpreter.

    “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you!”

  </i>
  (41:39). The haftarah cited above reiterates the parashah’s mention of wisdom when it recounts how two prostitutes come before King Solomon. Each had recently given birth, but one of the babies had died during the night. Now each woman insists that the living boy is hers. Solomon orders that the surviving baby be cut in two, to be divided between the claimants. When one woman pleads for the child’s life by agreeing to give the baby to the other woman, Solomon declares her to be the true mother. Thereupon, we read, the people “held the king in awe, seeing that he had within him divine wisdom” (I Kings 3:15–4:1).

    and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife
   </b>
  </i>
  (41:45). Uncomfortable with the Bible’s implication that Joseph married a non-Israelite, Jews of the Hellenistic period composed a romance
  <i>
   (Joseph and Asenath)
  </i>
  in which Asenath, the most beautiful young virgin in Egypt, converts to belief in the one true God before her marriage to Joseph. During the seven years of plenty, Joseph—as second-in-command to Pharaoh—would travel throughout Egypt to collect corn. He stopped at the home of Pentephres (Potiphera, Asenath’s father), where he met the bejeweled and richly attired Asenath. Upon her first sighting of Joseph, the haughty Asenath is smitten by the beauty of this man whom she first considered to be a common Israelite shepherd. Asenath’s parents suggest that the two beautiful virgins kiss, but Joseph declines to kiss a woman who eats the sacrificial meat of idols. Asenath retires to her chambers (a high tower) to don sackcloth and ashes and repent before God for her sins of idol worship and selfishness. She throws away her idols, fasts, prays, and humbles herself. On the eighth day of her self-flagellation, an angel appears in Asenath’s room and converts her to Judaism in an otherwise unknown ceremony involving a honeycomb and bees. Joseph returns, sees that Asenath is even more beautiful than before, and—having been informed by the angel of Asenath’s conversion—agrees to marry her in a ceremony before Pharaoh.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Later midrashic traditions also demonstrate uneasiness with the implications of Joseph’s marrying the daughter of an Egyptian priest. The sages told that Asenath was actually Dinah’s daughter from her liaison with Shechem (
  <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
   Genesis 34
  </a>
  ). To prevent public disgrace to his family when the child was born out of wedlock, Jacob had placed an amulet engraved with the divine name around the baby’s neck, and the angel Gabriel had carried her to Potiphar’s house in Egypt—where Potiphar’s childless wife raised her as her own daughter. (The Rabbis also insisted that Potiphar, Joseph’s master, was identical to Potiphera, Joseph’s father-in-law. See also
  <i>
   Vayishlach,
  </i>
  Post-biblical Interpretations, at 34:26.) Thus, according to this legend, Joseph ends up marrying his niece—a permitted marriage in Jewish law—and both are preserved from marrying outsiders.

   HE PAINFUL PAST
  </small>
  casts a long shadow on
  <i>
   parashat Mikeitz.
  </i>
  A father’s insensitive treatment of his sons—and the resulting sibling rivalry—form the back-drop to this tale. Though the women are never explicitly mentioned here, Jacob’s relationship to his sons’ mothers underlies his attitude toward their children. Among his wives, Jacob loves Rachel only, paying scant attention to Leah and the sisters’ maidservants. Likewise, Jacob clearly favors Joseph—Rachel’s first-born—showing little evidence of affection toward his other children. Blind to the difficult family dynamic he engenders, Jacob had sent Joseph alone to check on his brothers (37:13–14), setting up a situation rife with the potential for disaster. Joseph’s ensuing disappearance does nothing to stop Jacob from now favoring yet another son, Benjamin, Rachel’s second (see 42:4).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  But healing and transformation also begin here. A hint of what is to come is encapsulated in the name Joseph chooses for his first son, Manasseh, “For God has
  <i>
   made me forget
  </i>
  all the troubles I endured in my father’s house” (41:51). Clearly Joseph has not forgotten his troubles if they form the basis of his son’s name. Rather, it seems that the past is no longer a burden to him. He is able to thrive despite the horrors he suffered in the pit where his jealous brothers threw him (37:24). The name of Joseph’s second son, Ephraim, expresses this forward movement: “For God has
  <i>
   made me fruitful
  </i>
  in the land of my affliction” (41:52). His marriage to Asenath indeed bears fruit: their children will become tribes of Israel.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Joseph soon enables his older brothers to achieve a new relationship with
  <i>
   their
  </i>
  past as well, creating a set of circumstances that provides them with the opportunity to respond to favoritism differently. That would represent true
  <i>
   t’shuvah
  </i>
  (literally “return”), as the medieval Spanish rabbi and philosopher Moses Maimonides describes it:
  <i>
   t’shuvah
  </i>
  has occurred when a person, confronted with the opportunity to commit a transgression anew, refrains from doing so—not out of fear of being caught or failure of strength (
  <i>
   Mishneh Torah, Hilchot T’shuvah
  </i>
  <span class="arail">
   §
  </span>
  2.1).
  <i>
   T’shuvah
  </i>
  is, indeed, a primary theme of
  <i>
   parashat Mikeitz.
  </i>
  The word, too often mistranslated as “repentance,” actually means “return”—to the right path. Whereas “repentance” connotes remorse and self-flagellation, “return” suggests a kind of joyous homecoming. Our mistakes, rather than serving solely as a source of guilt, become also a springboard of opportunity.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Perhaps unwittingly, the brothers had begun the process of
  <i>
   t’shuvah
  </i>
  before meeting Joseph again in Egypt. In 42:1, at home with their father, they are referred to as
  <i>
   Jacob’s sons.
  </i>
  Two verses later, on their way to Egypt, we read, “So
  <i>
   Joseph’s brothers
  </i>
  went down…” Restating classic midrashim, Rashi opines that “they set their hearts on conducting themselves toward him as brothers.” This is an optimistic reading, but the language does suggest a change in their relationship to Joseph—though one that is undoubtedly buried beneath layers of guilt and denial.
 </div>
 <div class="image">

 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Joseph manipulates the situation so that the brothers’ feelings can rise to the surface. Simeon is held back as ransom. Alarmed at the prospect of returning home to their father one brother short, the brothers recall their cruelty of more than twenty years ago: “Oh, we are being punished on account of our brother! We saw his soul’s distress when he pleaded with us, but we didn’t listen…” (42:21). Perhaps because they could not hear him then, Joseph’s pleading was not mentioned in the initial narrative (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_37.1-36">
   Genesis 37
  </a>
  ). Now, for the first time, the brothers exhibit empathy toward Joseph.
  <a id="page_255">
  </a>
  According to Marsha Pravder Mirkin, empathy is the key to
  <i>
   t’shuvah:
  </i>
  “Empathy…is valuing another person enough to listen and hear her voice. It is a halting that then allows us to take action…that brings us closer to becoming the best we can be” (“Hearken to Her Voice: Empathy as
  <i>
   Teshuva,”
  </i>
  in Gail Twersky Reimer and Judith A. Kates, eds.,
  <i>
   Beginning Anew: A Woman’s Companion to the High Holy Days,
  </i>
  1997, p. 70).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  When the brothers return to their father in Canaan, a significant transformation has occurred. The first indication is their report of their time in Egypt: the brothers demonstrate a newfound sensitivity to their father’s feelings, sparing Jacob some of the more disturbing details of their journey. Modern Israeli commentator Nehama Leibowitz points out, for example, that they omit Joseph’s original plan to keep all but one of them in Egypt (42:16) and the threat of death (42:20) (
  <i>
   New Studies in Bereshit/Genesis,
  </i>
  undated, pp. 471–2). Then, in the face of their father’s fear for Benjamin’s life, Reuben offers his own sons’ lives in pledge for Benjamin’s (42:37). This is an impulsive and ill-conceived gesture—yet a marked change for the man whose idea it was to throw Joseph into the pit (37:22). Finally Judah, who had convinced his brothers to sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites (37:27), offers to take personal responsibility for the life of his youngest brother (43:9). Clearly, Judah is the brother who has matured and evolved the most.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  He and his brothers have made peace with their father’s favoritism. We might imagine that, after Joseph forces them to confront their guilt, they realize that their earlier violent response to their father’s unequal love has not changed Jacob. Aware that hurting Jacob or Benjamin will not get them greater attention from their father, they come to terms with Jacob’s failings, choosing compassion over anger in their dealings with him.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  This parashah ends mid-action, leaving us to wonder: Will Joseph really enslave Benjamin? How will the brothers respond? Will Joseph reveal his identity? The answers are not clear—because neither Joseph’s motivation for putting his brothers through this ordeal, nor their commitment to ethical behavior, are fully actualized until the next parashah. Perhaps the Rabbis broke off the story here to suggest that our choices are moment-to-moment decisions, the path never certain until the time comes to act. This cliffhanger ending is also a signal of hope, because
  <i>

  is always open to us.

  , Joseph marries an Egyptian. Their children, Ephraim and Manasseh (41:45–52), subsequently become progenitors of two Israelite tribes. A traditional blessing of children invokes these sons’ names. Around the Sabbath table for many generations, parents of sons have been reciting (as one English translation renders it): “May you be like Ephraim and Manasseh.” This biblical precedent, which recognizes the children of a non-Israelite mother as equal—even distinguished—members of Israel, invites an examination of assumptions as to who is counted as part of the people Israel and on what basis.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Most biblical texts implicitly reflect patrilineal descent: the child’s membership is determined by that of the father, not the mother. A major exception is the book of Ezra, which excludes foreign wives with their children from the community (Ezra 10:3). The implication: these children, like the mother, do not belong to Israel even though their fathers are Israelites.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  <a id="page_256">
  </a>
  In the post-biblical era, rabbinic halachah determined what became normative in Judaism: a child of a Jewish mother is a Jew. (For a detailed discussion, see Shaye Cohen,
  <i>
   The Beginning of Jewishness,
  </i>
  1999.)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  In 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis voted to return to patrilineal descent while also retaining matrilineal descent. The resolution required that in the case of intermarriage, a child’s Jewish identity must be confirmed through “acts of identification with the Jewish people” and “the performance of mitzvoth” (if either the mother or father is Jewish). According to this formulation, lineage is not determined by genetics alone but by identification with the Jewish people and by Jewish practice.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Rabbi Alexander Schindler, the visionary behind this effort, viewed this resolution as an extension of his vision of Outreach in response to the growing reality of intermarriage in American Jewish life. But he viewed the return to patrilineality also as an egalitarian issue. At a 1986 conference on Jewish unity he noted, “Why should a movement that from its birth-hour insisted on the full equality of men and women in religious life unquestioningly accept the principle that Jewish lineage is valid through the maternal line alone—all the more so because there is substantial support in our tradition for the validity of Jewish lineage through the paternal line!” (Princeton, New Jersey; March 16, 1986). (The Reconstructionist movement likewise adopted patrilineal descent as valid. The Conservative movement and Orthodox Jews do not accept patrilineal descent as defining who is a Jew.)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  While patrilineal descent has been criticized harshly across the greater Jewish world for dividing the Jewish people, its supporters see its inclusion not as a movement away from tradition but as a transition back to certain biblical roots in light of changed circumstances. Thus Rabbi Bernard Zlotowitz writes that “the changes enacted in the Reform movement fall within the traditional parameters of Judaism as a living faith. In times of necessity and for the welfare of the people, halachah was revised and traditions set aside in favor of more adaptive ones” (“Patrilineal Descent,” in
  <i>
   The Jewish Condition,
  </i>
  ed. Aron Hirt-Manheimer, 1995, p. 265). Zlotowitz notes several examples of adaptive changes that have become part of the halachah: the removal of the laws of the
  <i>
   sotah
  </i>
  (the wife suspected of adultery as in
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_5.1-31">
   Numbers 5

  <i>
   Naso,
  </i>
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#page_838">
   Contemporary Reflection
  </a>
  ), and the abolition of the husband’s right to divorce his wife without cause. These examples are similar in that the changed laws aim to provide for the Jewish community’s preservation and continuity in the face of changing circumstances and values.
