</b><small>DEUTERONOMY
</small><div class="tab-en">M<small>OST OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY</small> is cast as Moses’ final words to Israel while the people stand in the plains of Moab, poised to part from their long-suffering leader and at last enter the Promised Land. The book’s Hebrew title, <i>D’varim</i> (“words”), reflects the book’s presentation as a series of first-person speeches. The English name comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew expression <i>mishnei ha-torah</i> (17:18); in its biblical context, the phrase means “copy of the Teaching,” but as the book’s title, it takes on the sense of a “second [or: repeated] law.” This meaning also fits the nature of the book, which retells and reinterprets Israel’s history and laws for a new generation, often with marked differences from other versions. Deuteronomy recalls past experiences—particularly the divine wonders witnessed firsthand while fleeing from Egypt and traveling through the wilderness—as lessons for future behavior. It also includes legal material distinctive for its attention to political, social, and economic issues. The book emphasizes that security and prosperity in the Promised Land depend on adherence to these laws and lessons.

</div><div class="tab-enin">The notion of a covenant between God and Israel pervades Deuteronomy, influencing its form and content. Like political treaties found in other parts of the ancient Near East, the book begins with a historical prologue (1:1–4:43) that establishes the foundation of the covenantal relationship. Then, after a preamble to the laws (6:1–11:32), it spells out the terms of the covenant (12:1–26:15). Blessings and curses follow (28:1–68), detailing the consequences of adhering to or disobeying the covenant. Echoes of ancient Near Eastern treaties also can be heard in certain formulaic phrases that mark the book, like the charge to “love your God יהוה with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might” (6:5).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Deuteronomy envisions a society structured around absolute loyalty to the one God and one sanctuary. At the same time, it decentralizes political power and empowers broader segments of society. In Deuteronomy, the community as a whole is responsible for maintaining justice and economic stability, protecting the rights of every member, even animals. Deuteronomy repeatedly instructs the Israelites to care for the vulnerable and needy, particularly the stranger, widow, fatherless, and Levite (and his family). The inclusion of the Levites is a hallmark of Deuteronomy, a result of one of its defining features: the centralization of sacrificial worship in “the site that your God יהוה will choose” (12:5), which the Bible considers to be Jerusalem.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Most scholars date the core of the book (the legal collection in Deuteronomy 12–26 or the laws and surrounding sections in 4:44–28:68) to the 7th century <small>B.C.E.</small>; yet they recognize that various stipulations originated earlier and other parts of the book were added to and revised during the exilic or post-exilic periods (6th century). Many link Deuteronomy to the discovery of a “book of the <i>torah</i>” during renovations of the Temple (II Kings 22; II Chronicles 34). The female prophet Huldah is a central figure in that episode, for she authenticates the scroll as God’s teachings. (See <i>V’zot Hab’rachah,</i> Another View.)
</div><div class="tab-enin">The only woman named in Deuteronomy is Miriam (24:9). However, women are addressed in many parts of the book, even though the grammatically masculine language of the Hebrew often keeps their presence only implicit. Notably, 29:10 and 31:12 explicitly include women among those who take part in the covenant and are obligated to learn and follow the <i>torah.</i> Women figure prominently in the legal collection (particularly in <i>parashat Ki Teitzei),</i> as it addresses issues like the treatment of a captive woman, inheritance by the son of an unloved wife, adultery, forced and consensual sex, divorce, and levirate marriage.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Deuteronomy persistently warns of the divine wrath that will follow if either women or men disobey the covenant. Yet toward the end of the book, <i>parashat Haazinu</i> depicts God as a loving mother who labors to give birth to Israel and nurses Israel with honey and other delicacies of the Promised Land (32:13, 18), a striking image of the culmination of the saga that unfolds in the five books of the Torah.

</div><i>At the Threshold of Canaan
</i><div class="tab-en">E<small>VENTS IN PARASHAT</small> D<small>’VARIM</small> (“words”) take place on the plains of Moab in the lower Jordan valley, at the moment when Israel is poised to enter the land of Canaan. The parashah contains the beginning of Moses’ first farewell address, in which he reminds the people of their history: the journey from Mount Sinai (called Horeb in Deuteronomy), the scouts’ debacle, and encounters with foreign nations. Moses’ speech is not a neutral rehearsal of Israel’s history; rather, it underscores and supports central theological and ideological arguments found throughout Deuteronomy.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The words presented as Moses’ farewell address are directed toward a double audience. The first audience is one within the biblical text, the people of Israel about to enter the Promised Land. This imagined audience is standing at a pivotal moment: its members can either follow God’s commands or they can repeat the mistakes of the prior generation, presumably with disastrous consequences. Moses’ account is designed to encourage the people to make the right choice.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The second intended audience consists of Israelites who were contemporaries of the authors of this opening part of Deuteronomy. Most scholars believe that the material in this parashah, through 4:43 in the following parashah, was written during the Babylonian exile (586–538 <small>B.C.E.</small>) as an introduction to the laws that form the core of the book (Deuteronomy 12–26) and the prologue to these laws (Deuteronomy 4:44–11:32). The exilic authors of our parashah present a version of the past that accomplishes three goals. First, this account of past events emphasizes God’s role in Israel’s history. Second, it justifies Israel’s territory in theological terms. Third, it underscores obedience to God, as defined by Deuteronomy, as the key to Israel’s ongoing political and military success.

</div><div class="tab-enin">This parashah does not deal specifically with women. The seeming absence of women in this version of Israel’s narrative, however, raises an issue that has concerned biblical scholars in general and feminist scholars in particular, namely, how to assess the relationship between texts and a community’s social reality. Contemporary scholars, women and men alike, have shown how an account of the past is nearly always colored by an author’s own subjective position and ideological stance. These scholars train readers to guard against taking historical accounts as mirror representations of historical events; they encourage us instead to explore what historical accounts disclose about their authors’ historical and social situations. These methodological insights are particularly relevant to this opening part of Deuteronomy. In several places in this parashah, Moses’ accounts of events differ from those in Exodus or Numbers. A comparison of the different versions provides insight into not only the variety of historical traditions that flourished in ancient Israel, but also the variety of theological and ideological viewpoints that shaped them.

Some place names do not appear in the Torah’s primary accounts of Israel’s wandering in the wilderness. Plus, there is a contradiction between v. 1, which states that Moses delivered these words at various points during the course of Israel’s journey through the wilderness, and vv. 3–5, which state that he spoke them at the end of the journey, when the Israelites reached the plains of Moab. Despite such ambiguities, these verses possess a strong rhetorical logic, for they juxtapose sites of Israelite misbehavior and consequent circuitous wandering with sites of Israelite obedience and consequent success and progress toward the land of Canaan.
</div></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:1"><b>on the other side of the Jordan.</b> While most of Deuteronomy is presented as Moses’ speech to the Israelites before entering the land, the phrase “other side” here indicates that the entire book is addressed to the second intended audience, contemporaneous with the authors of the book as a whole, who were already looking back on the wilderness wandering and the entrance into the land as past events.<br></br><i><b>Suph.</b></i> Place names are arranged in a reverse order of the Israelites’ journey from Horeb (Sinai) to Moab. The Israelites first doubted God’s saving power near Suph, a reference to the Sea of Reeds (Exodus 14:10–12).<br></br><i><b>Paran.</b></i> The Israelites complained about wanting meat in the wilderness of Paran (Numbers 11); the episode of the scouts also occurred there (Numbers 13–14).<br></br><i><b>Hazeroth.</b></i> This is where Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses (Numbers 12:1–2).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:3"><b>It was in the fortieth year.</b> This verse emphasizes that Moses delivered the following words at the end of the forty years of wandering.

These two sites become emblematic of the choice that confronts the Israelites: obey God and prosper in the Promised Land or disobey and be condemned to wandering circuitously outside the land. For Deuteronomy’s exilic audience, Moses’ speech argues for the ongoing importance of heeding God by obeying the laws that follow in Deuteronomy 12–26.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="deu_1.6-18" ref="1:6">APPOINTMENT OF TRIBAL LEADERS (1:6–18)<div class="tab-enin">Moses begins his address by recounting God’s charge to the Israelites to set out from Horeb and journey to the Promised Land (vv. 6–8). Then, Moses recalls how he created an administrative infrastructure by appointing additional leaders (vv. 9–18).
</div></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:6"><b>Horeb.</b> Deuteronomy refers to Mount Sinai as Horeb (see at Exodus 18:5).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:7"><b>the hill country of the Amorites…as far as…the river Euphrates.</b> The Torah includes different understandings of the exact parameters of the land that it says God promised to the patriarchs. Some passages envision it as including only the land of Canaan, with its northern border at Lebo-hamath (in the Bekaa Valley of modern-day Lebanon, north of Damascus; see Numbers 13:21; 34:8). In contrast, the present verse understands the divine land grant more expansively to include both sides of the Jordan River, as far north as the Euphrates River (in today’s Iraq; see also 11:24). The variations remind us that the idea of the Promised Land does not correlate with a single historical reality. Rather, the phrase reflects ongoing attempts by different generations of Israelite writers to understand their people’s geopolitical aspirations and realities.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="1:9–18" ref="1:9"><b>1:9.</b> Moses recalls how he announced that the responsibility of leading the people, and especially of mediating their disputes, was too big for him to bear alone. He thus directs the people to choose wise and respected representatives from each of the tribes to serve as their leaders and judges.<br></br>This account conflates two earlier versions. In Exodus 18:13–27, Moses’ Midianite father-in-law, Jethro, sees that Moses is exhausting himself in judging all the Israelites’ disputes and advises Moses to delegate routine legal matters to others. In Numbers 11:10–17, the exasperated Moses complains to God about the burden of carrying the people single-handedly. God then tells him to appoint seventy representative elders upon whom God will bestow God’s holy spirit so that they can share the burden of leadership. In Deuteronomy’s version, Moses complains of the burden, as he does in Numbers, but the solution is closer to that proffered by Jethro in Exodus.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="1:10–11" ref="1:10"><b>Your God יהוה has multiplied…stars in the sky.</b> This statement echoes and confirms the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis 15:5 and 22:17; likewise, Genesis 24:60 predicts that Rebekah will “become thousands of myriads.”</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:12"><b>the trouble of you, and the burden, and the bickering!</b> In the previous verses, Moses declared that he cannot lead the people alone because of their divinely granted magnitude. Here, he claims that he needs help because of their negative behavior. The juxtaposition of these two reasons reinforces two paradoxical themes in this parashah: God’s loyalty to previous promises, and Israel’s chronic misbehavior.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:13"><b>Pick from, each of your tribes.</b> This crucial moment of autonomy and self-determination for the people contrasts with the earlier versions (Exodus 18; Numbers 11) in which Moses picks the leaders himself. The criteria for leadership here also differ from those in the prior episodes. In Exodus 18, judges must fear God, be trustworthy, and lack greed. In Numbers 11, participation in the divine spirit qualifies the leaders. Here, the leaders’ authority stems from their wisdom and experience, and the righteousness of their ruling derives from their ability to follow Moses’ directives regarding fairness and justice. This contrast among the three criteria for leadership underscores Deuteronomy’s respect for human wisdom and experience, and its faith in the guiding power of law.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:16"><b>stranger.</b> Heb. <i>ger</i> is more precisely translated as “resident alien,” for it refers to those who live within the Israelite community but cannot own land and therefore are vulnerable economically.</div><div class="head2" id="deu_1.19-46" ref="1:19">EPISODE OF THE SCOUTS (1:19–46)<br></br>This section recounts the events described in Numbers 13–14. Both versions tell of a reconnaissance mission by twelve scouts that results in the Israelites’ terrified refusal to attempt the conquest of the land of Canaan. After God vows to punish them for their lack of faith, the Israelites invade the land without God’s support and are defeated. As a result of this incident, God condemns the Israelites to linger in the wilderness until the current generation of adults dies off.<br></br>While the versions concur on major contours of the plot, there are significant differences between them. In Numbers 13:1–2, God requests the reconnaissance mission; in Deuteronomy 1:22, the people do. In Numbers 13:27–29, the scouts offer a mixed report: the land is bounteous and fertile, but its current inhabitants are terrifying. In Deuteronomy 1:25, they offer only a positive report. In Numbers 14:7–9, Joshua and Caleb encourage the Israelites to have faith in God’s ability to grant them victory. In Deuteronomy 1:29–33, Moses plays this role. In Numbers 14:24, 30, God says that only Caleb and Joshua may enter the land of Canaan, with no mention of whether Moses is included with the people or exempted. In Deuteronomy 1:37, Moses is prohibited from entering the land as a consequence of the people’s behavior in this episode.<br></br>These discrepancies underscore Deuteronomy’s particular point of view. In Numbers 14:1–4, the people respond to the fearsome account of the land’s inhabitants. Deuteronomy makes the people appear more cowardly: in 1:26–28, the people are too afraid to enter even though they have heard only a positive report. In this parashah, Moses states that he cannot enter the Promised Land as a result of the people’s misdeeds, not his own (as Numbers 20:12 claims).<br></br>Retelling events with new—even conflicting—data and perspectives illustrates the ongoing nature of interpretation, already taking place in the Torah itself. Deuteronomy’s retelling of the episode of the scouts demonstrates the effect of the experience of exile on the authors’ self-perception. For the exilic authors of this text, Israel’s history is tragically marked by the people’s inability to sustain their faith in God. For these authors, a primary goal is to encourage their contemporary audience to resist this pattern and abide by the covenant.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2a" id="deu_1.19-33" ref="1:19"><i>The Sending of Scouts</i> (1:19–33)<br></br>In Numbers 13:2, God begins the campaign for the Promised Land by telling Moses to send scouts into the land of Canaan. Here, that episode opens with Moses’ charge to conquer the land and his assurance that God will guarantee the Israelites’ victory. The people respond by asking Moses to send out scouts. By having the people ask for the reconnaissance mission <i>after</i> Moses has told them that God has guaranteed victory, the authors suggest that the request itself is symptomatic of the people’s lack of faith.</div><div class="tab-en"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:21"><b>take possession.</b> The root <i>y-r-sh</i> has a wide range of meanings, including “to take possession by force” and “to inherit.” Those quite different nuances of the root point to the complicated status of the acquisition of the territories identified as the Promised Land. The Bible depicts the entry into the land both as a violent (dis)possession and as a legitimate inheritance of what rightfully belongs to Israel through divine grant (see Joshua 1–Judges 1; see also at Deuteronomy 7:1–5, 24; 12:29–31; 31:16).<br></br><i><b>Fear not.</b></i> Confidence in God’s advocacy provides grounds for courage here and in other moments of military conquest and encounter.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:25"><b>“It is a good land that our God יהוה is giving to us.”</b> This concise report about the positive nature of the land contrasts sharply with the report in Numbers 13:27–29, which emphasizes both the quality of the land and the challenges it presents to conquest.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="1:28"><b>Anakites.</b> A people renowned for their mythic size (see at Numbers 13:28).</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="1:29–33" ref="1:29"><b>1:29.</b> Moses tries to reassure the people by reminding them that they have been witnesses to God’s miraculous power on their behalf.

Responsible for his corporate household’s continuity, a householder was expected to invest time and attention on raising his heir <i>(The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, pp. 385, 402). Certain biblical texts formally ascribe to the father the parental role as a child’s protector and guide, as in Psalm 103:13 and Job 29:16.<br></br>Alternatively, one can translate this verse’s simile in a gender-neutral sense: “as a parent carries a child.” In ancient Israel, both women and men cared for children. A notable example of a mother physically carrying her child is when Abraham places Ishmael on Hagar’s shoulder as he sends them away (Genesis 21:14).<br></br>Since this simile aims to describe God’s actions on Israel’s behalf, it is worthwhile to keep in mind that while a number of passages depict God metaphorically as a father (see at Deuteronomy 32:6), others avoid gender specification for parents. For instance, the metaphoric parent who gently nurtures Israel in Hosea 11 could be read either as mother or father. However, a few verses in the Bible clearly depict God in a maternal role. For example, the maternal imagery in the prophecies of consolation in Isaiah 40–66 describe both God’s power (Isaiah 42–14) and God’s unending devotion to Israel (Isaiah 49:14; 66:13). Likewise, Numbers 11:12 alludes to God as the one who gave birth to and cares for Israel (see also at Deuteronomy 32:13, 18). At its core, the imagery here conveys God’s solicitous care for Israel, without necessarily reflecting on God’s perceived gender. —<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2a" id="deu_1.34-46" ref="1:34"><i>The Consequences</i> (1:34–46)<br></br>In Numbers, God responds angrily to the Israelites’ fear and resistance and decides that none of the adult generation will live to enter the Promised Land except for Caleb and Joshua (see further at Numbers 14:10–38, especially at v. 21). In Moses’ retelling here, even Moses will be prohibited from entering the land on account of the people’s actions. When the Israelites hear God’s decree, they repent of their fearfulness and prepare themselves to obey God’s command to conquer the land.

In the first three episodes, God commands Israel not to militarily confront Edom (2:2–7), Moab (2:8–12), and Ammon (2:16–23) because they are Israel’s kin. Rather, the Israelites are instructed to ask permission to pass peaceably through these foreign lands and to purchase food and water. In the latter two episodes, God commands Israel to wage war against Heshbon (2:24–37) and Bashan (3:1–7) and to conquer their lands. In contrast to the rebelliousness seen in the prior section, Israel here follows God’s commands exactly and emerges unscathed from the first three encounters and victorious in the last two.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2a" id="deu_2.1-23" ref="2:1"><i>Peaceful Encounters with Edom, Moab, and Ammon</i> (2:1–23)<br></br>The parashah offers two reasons for God’s command to behave peaceably toward these nations, all three of which are located in modern-day Jordan. First, they are described as Israel’s kin: the Edomites are the descendants of Esau; Moab and Ammon are the descendants of Lot. (On the origin of Moab and Ammon from the sexual union between Lot and his unnamed daughters, see at Genesis 19:30–38.) Secondly, as members of the Abrahamic family tree, these nations also are recipients of divinely granted territory (2:5, 9, 19), which they gained by dispossessing earlier residents of the land (just as Israel is about to dispossess the Canaanites). This assertion communicates several cultural and theological messages: it emphasizes that the Israelites have a privileged relationship with nations that are considered their “kin”; and it argues that God controls the history and territory of all the nations in Israel’s purview, not just Israel itself.<br></br>The events recounted in this passage are found elsewhere in the Torah (Numbers 20–22 and Deuteronomy 23). Each of these traditions agrees that Israel never had a military conflict with Ammon, Moab, or Edom during their journey from Egypt to Canaan. However, they differ in their explanations why. In Numbers 20–22 the Edomites do not grant permission to pass through the land; Israel then turns away and takes another route. Numbers 21:24, which is difficult to decipher, suggests that Israel did not cross over into Ammonite territory because the Ammonites were strong. Deuteronomy 23:4–5 states that the Ammonites and Moabites are to be forever excluded from membership in Israel because “they did not meet you with food and water on your journey after you left Egypt,” which then becomes a rationale for the exclusion of foreign wives (see at 2:13). In this section of Deuteronomy, Israel is portrayed not as weak, but rather as obedient to God’s command and respectful of both kinship relationships and God’s geopolitical plans and decisions (compare 7:7).</div><div class="tab-en"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="2:4"><b>your kin, the descendants of Esau.</b> “Kin” is a key concept in the laws of Deuteronomy, where it signifies those toward whom each individual Israelite has a heightened relationship of responsibility. By identifying the Edomites as “kin,” this text suggests that they too, have a privileged relationship with the Israelites and that their rights, especially their property rights, are to be respected. (See 23:8–9, which permits their inclusion with Israel in the third generation.)</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="2:9"><b><i>2:9–13</i></b>. These comments about Moab closely parallel the previous section about Edom, with the addition of a digression regarding the occupation history of the lands of Moab and Edom. Both territories were formerly inhabited by strong peoples who were dispossessed as part of God’s plan of conquest and land distribution. The territory of Moab carries the name given by Lot’s eldest daughter to her son born of the incestuous relations with her father (see Genesis 19:30–38). This myth of origin reveals the Israelites’ complicated attitude toward the Moabites: while they are kin, they are also the product of a deeply transgressive sexual union. The book of Ruth, about a Moabite woman who becomes the wife of a Judahite man and great-grandmother of King David, illustrates another facet of the complicated attitude.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="2:10"><b>as tall as the Anakites.</b> See at 1:28.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="2:12"><b>just as Israel did in the land they were to possess.</b> The use of the past tense is anachronistic in the context of Moses’ speech since the conquest has not yet occurred. This discrepancy reminds readers that Deuteronomy as a whole is addressed to a later, post-conquest audience.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="2:13"><b><i>2:13.</i></b> The peaceful crossing that is recounted here contrasts somewhat with descriptions in Nehemiah 13:1–3, which imply some hostility from Moab. This hostility justifies the later exclusion of the Moabites, along with the Ammonites, from the Israelite community (23:4–7). Marriage with Ammonite and Moabite women is presented as a problem in Ezra 9–10 and Nehemiah 13, books dealing with the postexilic restructuring of Jewish life in Judah in the 5th century <small>B.C.E.</small>; but the book of Ruth offers a different perspective.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="2:14–15" ref="2:14"><b>2:14.</b> These verses mark the transition between the generation of the exodus and the generation of the conquest, as well as the transition between the wandering in the wilderness and the beginning of the acquisition of the Promised Land.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="2:15"><b>Indeed, the hand of יהוה.</b> This verse emphasizes that the deaths of the warriors were ordained and executed by God—and were not a natural part of the cycle of generations.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="2:16–23" ref="2:16"><b>2:16.</b> This passage describes encounters with Ammon in a way that parallels the two previous passages (vv. 2–7, 8–12); and like the one concerning Moab, it includes a digression about the occupation history of the land in question. The territory of Ammon, north of Moab, bears the name given by Lot’s younger daughter to her son from the incestuous relations with her father (see at 2:9–13 and Genesis 19:37).</div><div class="head2a" id="deu_2.24-3.11" ref="2:24"><i>Battles against Amorite Kings</i> (2:24–3:11)<br></br>This passage tells of the first of Israel’s conquests east of the Jordan and marks a transition from the peaceful encounters with Israel’s kin to the military conquest of the Promised Land. The text justifies the occupation of the Amorites’ land in three ways. First, in contrast to the prior sections dealing with Edom, Moab, and Ammon, this section omits any reference to a divine land grant to the Amorites, which suggests that the Amorites’ sovereignty is not expressly authorized by God and thus is invalid. Second, the text offers a belated moral justification for the conquest, for vv. 26–31 recall how Moses asks Sihon, the Amorite king, to allow the Israelites to pass freely through his land; but God hardens Sihon’s heart, and the king refuses to grant them passage. Third, the conquest of the Amorites serves as evidence for the idea that if the Israelites obey God’s commands, they will be rewarded with military victory.<br></br>This passage raises questions for contemporary readers, as it reveals the Bible’s own ambivalence about what qualifies as proper justification for conquest. Does one people’s moral transgressions justify military aggression by another people? Is any land not explicitly granted by God fair game for God’s chosen people? What is, or should be, the role of moral and theological considerations in political and military action?</div><div class="tab-en"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="2:24"><b>Up!

This parashah contains a theme relevant for women and all modern Jews, especially those interested in interpreting the text differently than has been done previously—for Moses, the great prophet and lawgiver, provides his own interpretation of Israel’s history and even law.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The book begins by claiming that what follows are Moses’ words, addressed to the Israelites (1:1), meaning that they are presented as his words, not those of the unidentified narrator. The text legitimates Moses’ comments, noting that they are “in accordance with the instructions that יהוה had given him” (1:3).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Before the start of Moses’ speech, we read, “Moses undertook to expound this Teaching” (<i>torah</i>; 1:5). The word translated as “undertook” expresses a decision connected with a new initiative or a bold action. The implication is that Moses initiates what becomes a long Jewish tradition: constant reinterpretation of the text. In an ironic and Jewish way, the Torah has already begun to be interpreted within the text.
</div><div class="tab-enin">A quick overview reveals that Moses’ address agrees with in general, but is not identical to, the way that these events are described in previous books. In some of these instances, the differences actually put more power in the hands of the people for things like choosing judges (Deuteronomy 1:13 versus Exodus 18:25) or sending out the scouts (Deuteronomy 1:22 versus Numbers 13:1). The book’s later portions even present some of the laws differently than in the prior books (see, for example, 12:2–28), indicating an early process of adaptation and interpretation, not just of history but of legal material as well.

</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Thus, the opening parashah of Deuteronomy, one of the most important books in the Hebrew Bible, teaches us an important lesson about the way traditions change over time, even within this most sacred text. This lesson is particularly relevant to women and liberal Jews, who at times have been criticized for engaging in what happens to be the very interpretive process witnessed in Deuteronomy—and exemplified in the work of the scholars who have contributed to this <i>Commentary.</i>

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano44-2"><div class="tab-en" id="deu_1.26"><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg28.jpg"/> <i><b>These are the words</b></i> (1:1). This parashah is read in the synagogue on the Sabbath immediately preceding Tishah B’Av, the annual commemoration of the destructions of the First and Second Temples. Therefore, the haftarah reading (from Isaiah 1:1–27) and many of the rabbinic commentaries focus on images and themes of rebuke, in which Israel is called upon to repent and embrace a higher level of moral and ethical conduct.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Midrash <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 1 is devoted almost entirely to the subject of rebuke. The midrash explains that Moses wrote the entire Torah, not just “these…words.” If so, the midrash responds, then “these words” must be words of reproof as similarly seen in Amos, Jeremiah, and in reference to King David, “These are the last words of David” (I Samuel 23:1). However, according to <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 1, in some cases it is God, rather than Moses, who voices criticism. For example, God rebukes the Israelites for complaining about the manna they ate during their trek in the wilderness (Numbers 21:5), asserting that kings would willingly choose to eat such a food for its apparent health benefits. The Israelites’ ingratitude reminds God of another ancestor, Adam, who was given Eve as a helper and mate—but then blamed her for his disobedience in eating the fruit (Genesis 3:12). In this unusual interpretation of Genesis 2–3, the Israelites’ behavior is explained through a comparison with Adam, whom the Rabbis deem cowardly and unjust in attributing his own sin to Eve.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Elsewhere, the Rabbis view rebuke as a vehicle for repentance. In <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 15:5 (Mandelbaum edn.), a late midrashic compilation based on the liturgical cycle of holy days, the midrash for the Shabbat before Tishah B’Av focuses on Israel’s abandonment of the study of Torah and its subsequent disastrous results: the destructions of the First and Second Temples. The Rabbis observe that a person who forsakes God but continues to study Torah will return to God by means of the power of the Torah itself.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>It was in the fortieth year</b></i> (1:3). The Sages understood this phrase to mean that Moses did not rebuke the Israelites until he was about to die. A midrash found in <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 2 and <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 54.3 cites a number of other cases of deathbed rebuke (including Abraham, Isaac, and Joshua), and then explains why one should not reprove another person until one’s death is near. The reasons include avoiding reproaching another person repeatedly, preserving the chastised person from shame in the presence of the rebuker, preventing the individual from holding a grudge against the rebuker, and permitting the rebuked one to leave in peace, “for rebuke should bring about peace.”
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Do not harass the Moabites…You will then be close to the Ammonites</b></i> (2:9, 19). The Rabbis often interpret these verses about Moab and Ammon in relation to Ruth and Naamah, two foreign women who influenced Israelite history. According to the Bible, Ruth, a Moabite, remained faithful to her mother-in-law Naomi after both were widowed, and she adopted Naomi’s people and their way of life. With Naomi’s help, Ruth married Boaz, and became King David’s great-grandmother. Naamah, an Ammonite, was King Solomon’s wife and the mother of Rehoboam, the king of Judah after Solomon (I Kings 14:21). On their behalf, according to BT <i>Bava Kama</i> 38b, God instructed Moses not to wage war against the Moabites or Ammonites: “The idea you have in your mind is not the idea I have in My mind. In the future I will bring forth two doves from them: Ruth the Moabite and Naamah the Ammonite” (also BT <i>Nazir</i> 23b, BT <i>Horayot</i> 10b–11a).
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">These talmudic passages also note that Lot’s two daughters were the matriarchs of Moab and Ammon through incestuous relations with their father (Genesis 19:37–38). The exegetical etymologies of the names of the offspring, and therefore of the tribes, are significant to the Rabbis. They view the name of the elder daughter’s son (Moab, or “my father”) as a reference to the sinful incestuous act, which explains for them why God forbade war with Moab but did not restrict Israel from harassing this potential enemy. The Rabbis use a Greek word, no doubt familiar from Roman rule, to describe this harassment as the seizure or subjugation of Moab for forced labor, particularly for public works projects. In the case of the younger daughter’s son (Ben-ammi, meaning “son of my people,” and rendered as Ammon), no reference is made to incest. As a result, the Sages explain, God forbade Israel from either warring with or harassing the Ammonites.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano44-3"><div class="tab-en"><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg29.jpg"/> T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> D<small>EUTERONOMY</small>, dramatically set just outside the land of Canaan, is comprised of a series of farewell addresses delivered by Moses as he prepares to die, forever barred from the Promised Land. Unlike the previous four books of the Torah, which are narrated in the third person, Deuteronomy is narrated almost entirely in the first person, the “I” of Moses persistently addressing a “you.” However, the “you” that Moses addresses is not always the same: sometimes it refers to all the Israelites who left Egypt, none of whom is still alive to hear these final words; other times it refers to their children, the generation of the wilderness, those now listening to Moses; still other times, it refers to a small group of Israelites, such as the twelve scouts, the two-and-a-half tribes who have chosen to settle on the east bank of the Jordan, or just Joshua and Caleb.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In fact, the word “you” punctuates this parashah like a drumbeat, appearing more than 100 times in slightly more than 100 verses, plus many other instances if the imperative verb form is included. Throughout, Moses primarily focuses on his I-You relationship with the people; yet the relationship is characterized more by conflict and alienation than by intimacy. As he recalls their journey, trying to make sense of the past forty years, he rewrites history, blaming the people for proposing that he send scouts to the land (an action commanded by God in Numbers 13:2) and for provoking him into delegating judicial authority (an idea suggested by his father-in-law Jethro in Exodus 18:17–23). Worst of all, Moses blames the children for the sins of their parents. Although it is the slave generation who has disappointed him, it is the next generation who now suffers Moses’ rancor and regret.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Despite the fact that Deuteronomy is an ancient book, the insights revealed in this parashah resonate with our modern ideas about human psychology. Contemporary psychologists describe a process known as counter-transference, whereby a therapist projects onto her patients certain conflicts still unresolved within her own life story. Parents, too, can be guilty of such unconscious projection, ascribing to their children their own youthful errors and defeats.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Therefore, we can read this first farewell speech as the presentation of a leader who engages in a kind of counter-transference when he reflects back to the people what has transpired between him and them over the past four decades. Standing before them now on the threshold of death, he wonders: What has happened to this people that I led out of slavery? What has happened to our shared resolve? What has happened to me, who was to serve as God’s emissary and representative? Why have the people doomed me—through their lack of faith, their ingratitude, their waywardness—to die without enjoying God’s promise? We can see in Moses’ flawed recollections and chastisement of the people a final attempt to reshape his life story so as to justify the past actions of this metaphoric parent.

</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Each year at the Passover seder, we Jews re-enact a similar drama, warning the next generation not to act the part of the <i>rasha,</i> the wicked child, in the haggadah’s parable of the Four Children. If we look closely at this exchange between the parent and the wicked child, we can hear in the former’s rebuke of the latter echoes of what we hear in this parashah. As some versions of the haggadah phrase the dialogue: “The wicked child asks: ‘What is this service to <i>you?…</i> And because these children exclude themselves from the community, you should chastise them, saying: ‘Because of what God did for <i>me</i> when <i>I</i> came out of Egypt.’ ‘For me’ and not ‘for them,’ for had they been there, they would not have been redeemed.” This is a painful text for many Jews. Who among us does not know a contrary child, perhaps our own, who feels so alienated from Judaism that she is willing to be excluded from the community?
</div><div class="tab-enin">In order to truly understand what this vignette in fact conveys, we need to probe further. When we look up the original context of the <i>rasha</i>’s question (Exodus 12:26), we discover that the Rabbis have twisted words out of context. In their original setting, these words were intended to reinforce the tradition, not disparage it; indeed, the Torah instructs <i>all</i> Jewish children to pose this question. Why then did rabbinic tradition put this question only in the mouth of the <i>rasha</i>? Weren’t they living proof that it is precisely this kind of personality—skeptical, provocative, contrary—that would best guarantee Jewish survival?
</div><div class="tab-enin">Like the parent of the <i>rasha,</i> Moses (as <i>parashat D’varim</i> presents him) seems ambivalent about his contrary people, and perhaps about himself. During much of his speech, he separates himself from the Israelites, addressing them as “you”; but on occasion he uses “we,” as when reminiscing about battles they fought together (3:12). For that brief moment, he regards them as equals who have shared important decisions about the distribution of land. But before he even finishes the verse, he pulls back, telling them four times how “I [that is, Moses] assigned” the regions of that apportioned land.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The parashah invites us to see that, like most parents, Moses has loved his children even when they have acted the part of the <i>rasha.</i> And like most parents, he has sometimes felt rejected and betrayed when his children have asserted their autonomy. As he now prepares to let them go into the new land, he must decide what his final message to them should be. Tellingly, the parashah concludes with his encouraging words to Joshua, “Do not fear…for it is your God יהוה who will battle for you” (3:22). In the end, Moses recognizes that this is a new generation about to enter the land, and they need his blessing as well as God’s.
