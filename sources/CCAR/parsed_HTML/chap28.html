  (“a person with
  <i>
   tzaraat
  </i>
  ,” that is, a skin affliction) completes the laws in Leviticus about impurity. Along with the preceding parashah,
  <i>
   Tazria
  </i>
  (
  Leviticus 12–13
  ), this parashah deals with laws about individuals afflicted with
  <i>
   nega tzaraat
  </i>
  , sometimes translated as “scaly disease” (the traditional translation as “leprosy” is somewhat misleading; see below) and with genital discharges.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Reflected in this passage is the Torah’s notion that certain actions and physical conditions produce an invisible, airborne pollution that invades the Sanctuary, the dwelling place of the divine Presence. (The Torah’s theology, like that in the extant literature of Israel’s ancient neighbors, imagines that the Deity can simultaneously dwell in a temple and in heaven, and that the earthly sanctuary is a smaller replica of its heavenly counterpart.) If the impurity is not disposed of, the accumulated pollution could cause Israel’s God to abandon the Sanctuary, an event thought to bring about national disaster.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  It should be emphasized, however, that in Leviticus
  <i>
   tzaraat
  </i>
  does not imply any sin on the part of the individual and that God is not depicted as the cause of
  <i>
   tzaraat
  </i>
  (except when it strikes the house; see at
  14:34
  ). For a rationale for Israel’s impurity laws, see the introduction to
  Leviticus 14
  .
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Leviticus 15
  is one among several biblical texts that have played a role in forming the Israelite and Jewish attitudes to menstruation. The perspective in this parashah lacks the stigma attached to menstruation in other biblical passages (see at
  15:24
  ). In
  Leviticus 15
  , the woman and man are equally impure if they have sexual relations while the woman is menstruating; the purification period and process for each is identical (
  15:24
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The Hebrew term
  <i>
   niddah
  </i>
  refers to a menstruant woman or menstruation.
  <i>
   Niddah
  </i>
  renders a woman impure, just as a man’s seminal ejection renders a man impure, and their impurity contaminates whatever they touch or sit on. The major difference, however, between a male’s ejaculation and female menstruation is the duration of impurity: since menstruation lasts longer, the woman is in the impure state considerably longer than the man.

  According to Leviticus, what are the practical consequences for the person who is deemed ritually impure? The impure person may not “touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary” (
  12:4
  ).
  <i>
   Parashat M’tzora
  </i>
  offers us a detailed account of restrictions placed
  upon the menstruant as well, but it does not provide a complete picture of the ways that menstruation was viewed in ancient Israel. On the practical impact of menstruation on a woman’s life, see at

    Purification Ritual for a Person with nega tzaraat

   (14:1–32)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en">
   T
   he word
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   refers to a skin disease sometimes translated as “scale disease,” “scaly disease,” “eruption,” and (erroneously) “leprosy.” The diagnosis of
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   was the concern of the preceding passage at the end of
   <i>
    parashat Tazria.
   </i>
   There, we were told that the person whom a priest diagnoses as having
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   “shall dwell apart—in a dwelling outside the camp” (
   13:46
   ). The present unit commences with the priest’s exiting the camp to initiate the ritual that will remove the afflicted person’s impurity. The process of rehabilitating the
   <i>
    m’tzora
   </i>
   (the afflicted person) has three stages: the first phase when the priest verifies that the individual is cured; the second, on the seventh day, when the afflicted person shaves, washes, and launders her or his garments; and the third stage, on the eighth day, when the afflicted brings a combination of sacrifices to the Sanctuary.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Of all the types of persons who become ritually impure, only the
   <i>
    m’tzora
   </i>
   undergoes such extensive ritual, preceded by exclusion from the community.
   Numbers 5:2
   demands the removal of other categories of impure people from the camp of Israel, but their situation does not apply to the later period, after settlement in the Land of Israel.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Bible’s ideas about purity are linked to the association of Israel’s God with life—as the Creator of life, whose life is eternal and whose laws give life. Thus the prophet Ezekiel calls the Torah’s legislation “laws of life” (33:15), while according to Psalm 116:9, one who walks with Israel’s God journeys in the “lands of the living.” Impurity, or estrangement from God, results from certain physical states that were associated with death. For example, a human corpse is a potent source of impurity that infects a house and the living people within it (
   Numbers 19
   ). The association of
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   with death is evident from
   Numbers 12:12
   , when—after Miriam has been “stricken with snow-white scales”—Aaron implores, “Let her not be as a stillbirth [literally: a dead person], which emerges from its mother’s womb with half its flesh eaten away!” This suggests that the appearance of the person afflicted with
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   was—at least in one form of the disease—akin to that of a disintegrating corpse (see at
   14:4
   ). The priest in Leviticus is charged with diagnosing no other disease except for
   <i>
    tzaraat,
   </i>
   which also indicates the symbolic nature of this condition.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="levi_vv.1-9">
   PURIFICATION RITUAL FOR THE AFFLICTED PERSON: DAYS 1–7 (14:1–9)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   As noted above, scale disease renders the afflicted impure because of its association with death. The purpose of the ritual in vv. 1–9 is to rid the individual of impurity and perhaps symbolically restore the person to life; thus the Hebrew
   <i>
    chai
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    chayim
   </i>
   (“alive” or “live”) is a repeated element. As a result of this phase of the ritual, the
   <i>
    m’tzora
   </i>
   (the afflicted person) may enter the camp but may not yet return home (v. 8).
  </div>
  <i>
   14:1. leper.
  </i>
  Heb.
  <i>
   m’tzora
  </i>
  refers to the person suffering from one of several skin diseases. Traditionally the term for those diseases,
  <i>
   tzaraat
  </i>
  , has been translated as “leprosy,” but in English that word nowadays refers to something other than the conditions that the Torah describes; these are now called “scale disease,” “scaly disease,” or (in this translation) also simply “affection” or “eruption.” [The JPS translators note: “Where a human being is declared impure by reason of
  <i>
   tzaraat,
  </i>
  the traditional translation ‘leprosy’ has been retained without regard to modern medical terminology.” The reason for doing so, according to a member of the translation committee, was “to convey the horror that the Bible attaches to this affliction.” —
  <i>
   Ed
  </i>
  ]
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   14:3. If the priest sees that the leper has been healed.
  </i>
  The priest is not a healer; rather, he facilitates the removing of ritual impurity once the person is healed.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   14:4. the priest shall order two live pure birds.
  </i>
  One of the two birds is intended to carry the impurity out into open country (v. 7). Thus it must be a wild bird, or else it would bring that impurity back to the community. The Rabbis identify the bird as an untamed sparrow. (Note the similarity between the function of the bird here and the scapegoat that in the Day of Atonement ritual bears the accumulated sin of the people; see
  16:21
  .)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   <b>
    cedar wood, crimson stuff, and hyssop.
   </b>
  </i>
  In
  Numbers 19
  , the ritual for the person rendered impure by a corpse specifies these same three substances. The similarity of ritual ingredients reinforces the link of
  <i>
   tzaraat
  </i>
  with death.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   14:5. fresh.
  </i>
  Heb.
  <i>

 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   14:7. He shall then sprinkle it seven times on the one to be purified.
  </i>
  The purpose of the process seems to be purification: the effects of the disease are transferred to the bloodied water, then the live bird that is dipped in it seems to carry away the person’s defilement. Why the person is sprinkled with the bloodied water is unclear, but this act is akin to the sprinkling ritual performed on the individual made impure via contact with a corpse (see
  Numbers 19
  ). In the latter case, the water is mixed with another reddish material, the ashes of a red (or brown) cow. Elsewhere in Leviticus the sprinkling of the blood of a purgation sacrifice removes impurity (
  4:6
  ,
  17
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   14:8.
  </i>
  Laundering the garments worn during periods of impurity is a necessary element in rehabilitation (
  11:25
  ,
  40
  ;
  Leviticus 15
  ;
  Numbers 19
  ). The person afflicted with
  <i>
   tzaraat
  </i>
  has to shave all body and head hair before bathing, which reflects the severity of the defilement.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <b>
   <i>
    After that, the camp may be entered.
   </i>
  </b>
  The individual may enter the camp—but not her or his tent, as impurity can still be communicated to those in the same dwelling.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   14:9. then shall be pure.
  </i>
  After seven days of waiting, and a second round of laundering, shaving, and washing, the individual can now go home.
  <br>
  </br>
  SACRIFICE BY THE AFFLICTED PERSON: DAY 8 (14:10–20)
  <br>
  </br>
  The last phase of the process involves the decontamination of the Sanctuary and the complete rehabilitation of the individual. The ceremony of the final stage includes a procedure (v. 14) similar to the ordination of the priests in
  Leviticus 8
  (see also
  Exodus 29
  ), the only other case where such a ritual is required. This correspondence of the
  <i>
   m’tzora

  with the initiated priest elevates the formerly excluded person.

    Diagnosis and Purification of a House with nega tzaraat

   (14:33–53)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en">
   Leviticus 13
   detailed the diagnosis of
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   in people, fabric, and leather garments. The same symptoms could also characterize the interior walls of houses (see
   13:47–59
   ).
   <i>
    Tzaraat
   </i>
   in a house seems to be a kind of mold or fungus that attaches itself to building stones. After a seven-day quarantine, if the fungus has spread, the affected stones and all interior plaster have to be removed and transferred to a dump for impure waste, surely outside the city limits. The house is then repaired, unless the mold returns. If, after the initial seven-day quarantine, the infection has not spread, the priest conducts a purification rite (
   vv. 49–53
   ) similar to that for an afflicted person on the first day after she or he has been declared healed (
   vv. 1–7
   ).
  </div>
  <b>

  This is the only case in Leviticus claiming that God causes a form of

  Even here, the text does not present illness and disease as being divine retribution. Leviticus offers no explanation for the cause of disease. Instead, it focuses only on protecting persons and the sanctuary from contamination once the disease appears.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   14:36. The priest shall order the house cleared.

  The house is emptied prior to its inspection so that the owner incurs no financial loss from the priest’s diagnosis. According to vv. 46–47, only those who may have entered the house during the quarantine are considered impure.

   Normal genital discharges (semen or blood) render the individual impure and necessitate laundering, bathing, and waiting till nightfall in order to regain the state of ritual purity; for the male, this means the nightfall after the ejaculation, and for the female, since it involves blood, the evening of the seventh day. No sacrifice need be offered for normal discharges. No sin is imputed to the man with a seminal discharge. In fact, the commandment to “be fruitful and multiply” (
   Genesis 1:28
   ) necessitates seminal emissions. When a man comes in contact with menstrual blood through intercourse with a menstruating woman, he too must wait seven days before he is ritually pure. Abnormal discharges (those described in vv. 2–15 and vv. 25–30) involve a longer waiting period and necessitate a purgation offering to eliminate the resulting impurity that accumulated in the sanctuary. Leviticus imputes no wrongdoing to the individual who suffers from those maladies.

  when this term applies to a male, it refers only to one with abnormal discharge. The underlying condition might be a form of gonorrhea or an infection of the urinary tract or other organs. The term conveys the idea of “oozing” or “exuding greatly”; the same verb appears in the expression “a land flowing with milk and honey” (see, for example,
  Exodus 3:8
  ). For the term’s specific application to females, see below (
  vv. 19, 25

 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">

  The basic principle that emerges is that all articles under a man with abnormal discharge are impure; as such, they in turn disseminate a one-day impurity to all who touch them. This principle also applies to the menstruating woman (
  v. 21
  ).

  </i>
  This verse has puzzled commentators since ancient times, because it states that if the
  <i>
   zav
  </i>
  rinses his hands in water, the person whom he touches will not contract impurity. Most likely this is a concession to allow the person suffering from a chronic discharge to retain somewhat normal social relationships: as long as he rinses his hands on a regular basis, he may have contact with family and community. These rules would seem to apply as well to women with genital discharges, even though such is not stated in the text (see at
  v. 20
  ).

  Severe impurities necessitate sacrificial offerings. The sacrifice of two birds corresponds to the offering given by the person of insufficient means in
  12:8
  and
  14:21
  . The reason a
  <i>
   zav
  </i>
  makes a donation of lesser value is probably due to the correspondence of his title to the
  <i>
   zavah
  </i>
  (the woman who suffers from irregular bleeding); the Torah tries to minimize the economic burden for her (see at
  v. 29
  ), and consequently, for him.

  Just as seminal emissions render objects impure (vv. 16–17), so they also make a man’s sexual partner impure. The key term in each verse is
  <i>
   shichvat zera
  </i>
  (“emission of semen,” literally “a laying down of [what can become] offspring”). Many cultures in the ancient world share the idea that sexual intercourse and participation in religious ritual must be separated by washing and waiting. Earlier in the Torah, Moses anticipated God’s descent upon Mount Sinai by prohibiting the Israelites from sexual relations for three days (see at
  Exodus 19:10

  15

 <div class="tab-en">
  Frequent menstruation is the product of various factors of modern life that were not relevant to our foremothers. Women in ancient Israel (and the ancient world in general) probably menstruated less frequently than modern women, for several reasons. Due to sparser diet, females in pre-modern times began to menstruate on average at age 14, as opposed to an average of age 12 today. Women married soon after they began to menstruate, and generally they experienced more pregnancies in their lifetime than their average modern Jewish counterparts (see
  <i>
   B’reishit,
  </i>
  Another View
  ). Breast-feeding typically for three years (see at
  Exodus 2:10
  ) would have further reduced the number of menstrual cycles they experienced. Therefore, the regulations in this passage probably had a smaller practical impact than we might at first imagine.

  The original meaning of the key term for menstruation in the Bible,
  <i>
   niddah,
  </i>
  is unclear, but several Hebrew roots with the letter combination
  <i>
   n-d
  </i>
  have the general sense of “expel” or “throw.” It is possible that the word was used for the expulsion or elimination of the menstrual blood (see also at
  12:2
  ). In
  Leviticus 15
  , the term is neutral and without any stigma. In contrast to the pragmatic attitude in this parashah, some later biblical texts use the term
  <i>
   niddah
  </i>
  as a term of abomination and revulsion, including
  Leviticus 20:21
  ; Lamentations 1:8, 17; Ezra 9:11; and 11 Chronicles 29:5. Ezekiel, a 6th-century
  <small>
   B.C.E.
  </small>
  prophet, justifies the destruction of Jerusalem by saying: “Their ways were in My sight like the impurity of a menstruous woman” (36:17). Note that there and in Ezekiel 18:6 and 22:10, the prophet uses the term
  <i>
   niddah
  </i>
  for the menstruating woman herself. At the same time, however, the expression
  <i>
   mei niddah
  </i>
  (“water of lustration”) refers to a potion that
  <i>
   removes
  </i>
  impurity generated by a corpse; it could be translated “water for
  <i>
   the elimination of
  </i>
  impurity” (
  Numbers 19:9
  ,
  13
  ,
  20
  ,
  21
  ; see also Zechariah 13:1). On

  [In Leviticus, the menstruant is separated from the sancta (the sacred). The social and ritual isolation of menstruating women is found in many cultures around the world (“Introduction,” Thomas Buckley and Alma Gottlieb, eds.,
  <i>
   Blood Magic,
  </i>
  1988, p. 12). However, the social functions of menstrual taboos are culturally variable and specific. In one society, these taboos function to subordinate women; in another, they give women exclusive ritual powers; and yet another culture views menstruation ambivalently, as both containing and enhancing women’s power (Buckley and Gottlieb, p. 14). The legislation in Leviticus can be seen as moderate in that the menstruating woman remains at home and has somewhat normal family and social relationships; see above at
  v. 11

  v. 20

  What are the practical implications of the regulations in this passage?
  Leviticus 15
  nowhere requires the isolation of the menstruant or her removal from her normal context to some other space. The rules concerning her are similar to those of the (male)
  <i>
   zav.
  </i>
  Objects under her are impure and impart a one-day impurity to all those who touch them (
  15:4–6
  ,
  20–22
  ). The person who touches her becomes impure (
  15:7
  ,
  19
  ). Two additional rules for the woman in
  <i>
   niddah
  </i>
  are absent for the
  <i>
   zav.
  </i>
  anyone who has sexual relations with her is impure for seven days (
  v. 24
  ), and the person who touches an object on the same bedding or chair where she is sitting becomes ritually polluted (
  v. 23
  ; the Hebrew is difficult). Thus, the menstruant has to be careful regarding where she lies and sits, and she must avoid the touch of others (although the laws are addressed to others, not the woman herself). According to
  v. 11
  , the
  <i>
   zav
  </i>
  may touch another person without consequence but only if he has rinsed his hands; the text does not say whether this applies to the menstruant, but logic suggests that it does. After all, menstruation, a “normal” cause of impurity, does not require a purgation offering as does the “abnormal” case of the man with a chronic discharge. Further, if the priestly regulations mean to imply that anyone whom she touches would become impure, then all the people for whom she cares in the course of her duties would be affected, whether they be her children or the elders of her household. It therefore seems likely that Leviticus intends that the frequent rinsing of her hands would allow the woman to function in her usual capacity.

  </i>
  The central concern of
  Leviticus 15
  is couched in this verse: the violation of purity rules when a man has sexual contact with a menstruating woman (
  see the outline in the unit introduction
  ). Of all the various kinds of contact with a woman in
  <i>
   niddah
  </i>
  or her belongings, only sexual contact results in a period of impurity equal to that of the woman herself—seven days. Perhaps this is because the male comes into direct contact with her menstrual fluid.
  Leviticus 20:18
  twice denounces both sexual partners as guilty for revealing “her source [or: flow] (of blood),” so it is the intimate nature of their contact that explains his extended period of pollution.
  <br>
  </br>
  Elsewhere we find more severe consequences for sex with a menstruating woman than simply becoming ritually impure.
  Leviticus 20:18
  decrees that “both of them shall be cut off from among their people.” Both that verse and
  Leviticus 18:19
  place this act in the context of violations of the Covenant that imperil Israel’s tenancy in the land of Canaan. (On
  <i>

  This verse defines the
  <i>

  </i>
  as a woman who experiences either genital bleeding that is not consistent with her normal menstrual cycle, or a menstrual period that is prolonged beyond the Torah’s norm of seven days (
  v. 18
  ). In both these cases, the rules that apply to the normally menstruating woman apply to the
  <i>
   zavah
  </i>
  here during the time of her bleeding and for seven additional days after the bleeding stops (
  v. 28
  ). The Christians’ New Testament mentions a woman who experienced bleeding such as this for twelve years (Matthew 9:20; Mark 5:25; Luke 8:43).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">

  These rules for the woman with abnormal bleeding correspond to those that apply to the woman in

  in vv. 20–22. Although the additional strictures for the woman in
  <i>
   niddah
  </i>
  of vv. 23–24 are not repeated in this passage, it is logical to assume that they apply to the
  <i>
   zavah
  </i>
  as well: anyone who touches an object that is resting on the bed or chair upon which she sits is polluted; and the man who has intercourse with her is impure for seven days.

  12:8

  The exact force of the rare Hebrew verb here is disputed. The verbal root refers to separation. Thus this clause may well be telling Aaron (see
  v. 1
  ) and his descendants—whose priestly function it is to “distinguish between…the impure and the pure” (

   Y MOVING FROM

  a state of ritual impurity to one of ritual purity, the everchanging human body serves as the index for the transformation of identity. The person departing from the state of
  <i>
   m’tzora
  </i>
  (a person with
  <i>
   tzaraat
  </i>
  , conventionally translated as a “leper”) follows about ten steps that separate the ritually pure from the ritually impure state. The spectrum between the pure and the impure becomes apparent in the gradations of being outside the camp, then inside the camp but outside one’s tent, and finally inside the community and inside the home. That the ritually impure state is transitional becomes apparent in the time-bound nature of each stage. The body passes through the various stages and is likely to cross several borders between ritually pure and impure over the course of its existence.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  As the body undergoes the permutations of ritual purity and impurity, the impure body is sometimes exiled—but not abandoned to its exile. The appearance of a priest outside the camp (
  14:3
  ) signals that exile is ephemeral and that restoration will begin. No particular priestly category fixes the body, but rather it moves through a full range of categories. This sense of the body as changeable and the potential reversibility of its status are what underlie prophetic notions that sinful actions can be retracted and a dire fate averted.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Focus on the body emphasizes the changes undergone by the self in the process of becoming another self. Signs on the body gauge identity and mark transformation. When the sick are healed, their bodies bear the proof. Yet one’s body is not only an indicator of change but also a vessel of memory. Illness and trauma are remembered by nerves, muscles, and scars. The body that gives birth will forever maintain a link with its offspring. The body attests to change as well as to the indelibility of experience. Therefore descriptions of identity, predicated as they are on the language of body, convey the tension between the possibility of change and the integrity of forms.

  already appears in

  5.7, the Rabbis emphasize that Miriam’s contraction of

  for both people and houses (
  14:5–6
  ,
  50–52
  ), and in the case of corpse impurity (
  Numbers 19:8
  ). All of these cases of ritual impurity last for at least seven days. However, the Torah notably does not mention the requirement of immersion in water for cases of impurity of similar duration that are specific to women, such as those resulting from birth, menstruation, or irregular genital bleeding. The Mishnah assumes that immersion in fresh water applies to women’s impurities as well (
  <i>
   Mikvaot

  1:8).

   <i>
    When a woman has a discharge

  </b>
  (
  15:19
  ). This passage establishes the rules of purification concerning a woman’s menstrual period. The Rabbis developed these regulations into an entire tractate called
  <i>
   Niddah,
  </i>
  the “menstruating woman,” which is part of the mishnaic order called
  <i>
   Purities.
  </i>
  Much like the priestly writers of Leviticus, the Rabbis did not consider purity and impurity a matter of morality, but rather a matter of ritual status with regard to access to the Temple in Jerusalem. Thus, many of the rules of purity and impurity detailed in the biblical passage here and in Mishnah
  <i>
   Niddah
  </i>
  had no application in a post-Temple reality. However, the rules of sexual abstinence during the wife’s menstrual period, which the Rabbis derived from
  Leviticus 18:19
  and
  20:18
  , are not dependent on the historical existence of the Temple and continue to regulate the sex life of married couples in traditional Jewish communities to this day. Indeed, many of the rabbinic discussions in BT
  <i>
   Niddah
  </i>
  focus on the workings of menstruation and on women’s physiology in general, instituting the rabbinic sage as a sort of gynecological expert to be consulted when problems arise.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <b>
   <i>
    a discharge of blood for many days
   </i>
  </b>
  (
  15:25
  ). The Torah assumes a menstrual calendar of seven days of bleeding. It considers any bleeding beyond seven days or outside of the seven regular days to be abnormal. It categorizes a woman with an irregular discharge as a
  <i>
   zavah,
  </i>
  parallel to the male category of
  <i>
   zav
  </i>
  (
  15:13
  ). In a tractate called
  <i>
   Zavim,
  </i>
  the Mishnah discusses both men and women with irregular genital discharges. In biblical law, the rules of purification for the
  <i>
   zavah
  </i>
  differ from the rules for menstruation. Notably, the afflicted woman must count seven days after the irregular discharge has ceased before purification can take place. The Talmud, however, merges the two categories of regular and irregular bleeding. Accordingly, a woman is to count seven “white” days without discharge after her menses before she immerses in a
  <i>
   mikveh
  </i>
  and resumes marital intimacy. The Talmud famously attributes this more stringent practice to women: “Rabbi Zera said: The daughters of Israel (
  <i>
   b’not Yisrael)
  </i>
  have imposed upon themselves the stringency that even where they observe only a drop of blood the size of a mustard seed, they wait on account of it seven clean days” (BT
  <i>
   Niddah
  </i>
  66a). One should not dismiss Rabbi Zera’s attribution of this legal stringency to women too readily, considering that throughout Jewish history women have used the laws of
  <i>
   niddah
  </i>
  toward their own spiritual empowerment, as well as for practical purposes, including control over their sex lives.

  <i>
   Parashat M’tzora,
  </i>
  then, with its focus on menstrual impurity (
  15:19–24
  ), seems to impart the same kind of unfavorable sense. Rejecting our own received biases and patriarchal assumptions about menstruation, however, can help us form a contemporary view of these so-called taboos.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  What the Torah deems as
  <i>
   tamei
  </i>
  (“impure”) or
  <i>
   tahor
  </i>
  (“pure”) is not actually attached to cleanliness, even though they are often translated as “unclean” and “clean.” These Hebrew words are ritual terms, meant to designate those in a physical and spiritual state unable to enter the
  <i>
   Mishkan
  </i>
  (Tabernacle; and in later times, the Temple), or those able to do so. Those who are considered
  <i>
   tamei
  </i>
  are taboo (which is not what we think of as “bad”), meaning that they cannot enter the sacred space; and the thing that causes them to be ineligible to enter is also understood to be taboo. Anthropologists note that taboos are the system by which a culture sets aside certain objects or persons as either sacred or accursed. Such objects or persons inspire both fear and respect. Penelope Washbourn writes: “Menstruation symbolizes the advent of a new power that is
  <i>
   mana
  </i>
  …‘sacred.’…A taboo expresses this feeling that something special, some holy power, is involved, and our response to it must be very careful” (in
  <i>
   WomanSpirit Rising,
  </i>
  1989, p. 251). This mixed message of fear and power, contact and avoidance, actually dominates all the Torah’s passages around blood. Blood, which is to be avoided in the realm of eating and sex, is the same substance that atones for the community in the sacrificial system, and it binds the individual male child to the Israelite covenant through circumcision. Blood both sustains and endangers; it is the medium of plague or deliverance. Thus blood— like every potent symbol—has the double quality and the twin potential of birth and decay, purity and impurity.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  So too with menstrual blood. We who are often uninspired and unaffected by our bodies should reject the negative connotation of taboo—and explore, instead, the positive and sacred aspect. Surely a religion that has a blessing for an activity as mundane as going to the bathroom should have a blessing for the coming and going of menstruation. Since the male composers of the liturgy, living in a world where modesty was central and women’s bodies were a mystery at best, were not able—or more likely, not willing—to imagine such a blessing, we must be the first generation to do so.
 </div>
 <div class="image">

 </div>
 <div class="image0">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  More than thirty years ago, I did just this: I wrote a blessing for menstruation and have been writing about it and teaching it ever since. When I crafted my
  <i>
   b’rachah,
  </i>
  I reappropriated the difficult and offensive morning blessing in the traditional prayer book, which reads: “Blessed are You, Adonai our God, Ruler of the Universe, who has not made me a woman.” (Traditionally, women say instead, “who has made me according to Your will.”) Each month, when I get my period, I say:
  <i>
   “Baruch atah Adonai, eloheinu melech haolam, she’asani ishah
  </i>
  : Blessed are You, Adonai our God, Ruler of the Universe, who has made me a woman.” Saying the blessing becomes a revolutionary moment, for this slight change in wording—changing the negative
  “who has not made me a woman” into the positive “who has made me a woman”—affirms my holiness and sanctity within the context of menstruation, not despite it.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  I believe it is possible to rescue the aspects of mystery inherent in menstruation. While we reject menstrual huts, a separation from the sancta, and antiquated notions of cleanliness, we can still emerge with a sense of the overwhelming mystery of life and death that is embodied in our corporeal female selves. While many women associate menstruation with physical pain and discomfort, the experience nonetheless involves a degree of power. We should reject the notion that menstruation makes a woman “unclean” and instead think of this time as a period of intense electrical charges—the charge of life and death—pulsing through our bodies. Blu Greenberg urges us to focus more on the positive, “to restore that element of holiness to our bodies, our selves” (
  <i>
   On Women and Judaism,
  </i>
  1981, pp. 118–120).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  We can also consider a connection between menstruation and covenant. The prophet Zechariah speaks to “daughter Jerusalem” and “daughter Zion” about “your covenant of blood” as that which releases prisoners from the dry pit (
  9:9–11
  ). It does not say “the covenant of blood,” as most translations render it, but rather emphasizes that blood is the focus of the covenant. The address to the feminine persona suggests that all “daughters of Zion” have that covenant of blood. It is through menstruation—from puberty when we accept our responsibilities as Jews, through the elder years when bleeding stops and deep wisdom starts—that the entire world is saved from the dry pit of death, in which there is no water, no womb, no regeneration, no rebirth.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  See menstrual blood, then, as women’s covenantal blood—just as the blood of
  <i>
   b’rit milah
  </i>
  (ritual circumcision) is men’s. The possibilities for rituals around this abound. For women too have a
  <i>
   b’rit
  </i>
  (covenant) inscribed in our flesh as an “everlasting covenant” (
  Genesis 17:19
  ): not just once, at eight days old, but every single month. And
  <i>
   M’tzora,
  </i>
  in its ancient and perhaps awkward way, attempts to remind us.
