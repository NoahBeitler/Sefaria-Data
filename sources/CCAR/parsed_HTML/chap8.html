<div class="chap">וישלח ✦ <i>Vayishlach</i></div><div class="chap1">GENESIS 32:4–36:43<i>From Jacob to Israel
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYISHLACH</small> (“And he sent”) features Jacob—the third and final patriarch—as he becomes the last individual to receive a personal covenant with God. In a life-transforming event, Jacob meets God face to face, and his name is changed to “Israel,” which may reflect his own struggles with God. After Jacob, all future covenant renewals will be made between God and <i>B’nei Yisrael</i> (literally “the children of [the patriarch] Israel”)—the Israelites as a whole, who will continue the struggle.
</div><div class="tab-en1">All of the women in this parashah (except for those in the genealogy of Esau in Genesis 36) are members of Jacob’s immediate family. What stands out is the troubling story of Dinah and Shechem (Genesis 34), although Dinah’s role in the narrative is revealingly minor. While she functions as a trigger for the event, the tale focuses on the relations between the men of the family of Jacob and the Canaanites among whom they have settled. The major concern in the story as told is not the personal fate of an individual woman (or man) but the political relationship between Israel and the other inhabitants in the land. Dinah becomes a symbol in the exploration of the theme of identity—of self and of other—that began with the story of Abraham.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The other women in Jacob’s household appear in passing in this parashah, with Rachel’s death as a poignant conclusion. In general, these passages enable us to view the women of the story as intermediaries linking together groups of men, while moving about in the social world of the male characters—who have the authority to represent both the women and the subordinate men in their households.

</div><div class="head1">JACOB’S STRUGGLES WITH GOD AND MEN (32:4-33:20)
</div><div class="tab-en">Even before birth, Jacob was portrayed as a character who struggles. He struggled in the womb (25:22). He struggled with Esau for birthright and blessing (Genesis 25 and 27). After twenty years of living in Aram he struggled with Laban (Genesis 31) and, ever since he has headed back toward the land of Canaan, he has been facing a potentially dangerous encounter with his estranged brother Esau. Now, on the way home, Jacob endures a physical confrontation with God—and as a result, has his name changed to Israel. The struggle between humans and God is a prevalent theme in the Hebrew Bible that culminates not with Jacob/Israel, but with <i>B’nei Yisrael,</i> his descendants—who continually engage in either avoidance of, or confrontation with, their God.
</div><div class="head2" id="ge_32.4-16">JACOB SETS OUT TO MEET ESAU (32:4–16)
</div><div class="tab-en1">According to the preceding narrative, Jacob had wronged his brother, Esau, and then left home (27:1–28:5). Now Esau comes to meet Jacob with four hundred men, and Jacob is terrified. Jacob responds by making use of his two greatest assets: a wily mind, and God’s covenant with his ancestors.
</div><b>messengers.</b> Heb. <i>malach,</i> the same word as in v. 2 (just before this parashah begins), where it was translated “angels.”</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="32:12"><b>“Save me, I pray, from my brother’s hand.”</b> Jacob’s prayer (vv. 10–13) is one of the few prayers recorded in the narrative books of the Bible. (Another is Hannah’s prayer of victory; I Samuel 2.) The prayer opens and closes with direct allusions to God’s covenant with Abraham (vv. 10 and 13).</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="32:17–22" ref="32:17"><div class="head2" id="ge_32.17-33">JACOB STRUGGLES WITH GOD (32:17–33)<br></br>Separated from all his recent acquisitions and now alone, Jacob wrestles with a mysterious being. This is a life-altering event for him. He demands a blessing, and receives a name change that signifies a permanent change in Jacob’s character.
</div><b></b> Forms of the word “face” (Heb. <i>panim)</i> occur seven times in this passage (at times translated as “in front of” or “ahead of”), providing a verbal link to the life-altering theme in the events that are about to occur. The repetition conveys the force of this moment in Jacob’s life and of all that he must face—including his brother. Two encounters, first with his God and then with his brother, will be united when he eventually says to Esau, “I’ve seen your face—like seeing God’s face!” (33:10).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="32:23"><b>eleven children.</b> Heb. <i>y’ladim</i> here must actually refer to “boys” only, because the narrator specifies eleven of them. Dinah, Jacob’s daughter (30:21), is not included in this count. [Apparently the narrator here relates to Jacob’s children in genealogical terms, their being the ancestors of the future tribes of Israel. On women and biblical genealogies, see at 10:1. —<i>Ed</i>.]</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="32:25"><b>a man wrestled with him.</b> In Hosea 12:5–6, the prophet states specifically that Jacob “strove with a divine being (<i>elohim</i>); he strove with an angel <i>(malach)</i> and prevailed.” However, here the mysterious being that appears suddenly as Jacob’s adversary is described only as an <i>ish,</i> translated here as “a man,” as is conventional. However, given the flexibility in biblical Hebrew of the term <i>ish,</i> it can mean a challenging figure that need not be human but could be divine.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="32:27"><b>“I will not let you go unless you bless me!”</b> Jacob insists that the struggle lead to blessing.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="32:29"><b>“Israel.”</b> The original meaning of this twopart name cannot be stated definitively. In most cases, <i>el</i> is a noun meaning “God,” but sometimes it has a more general sense of “divine” or “superlative.” Also unclear is whether <i>el</i> is subject or object of the name’s verbal portion, which itself is ambiguous. Thus this name can be construed as “he struggles with God,” or “God struggles,” or “God rules,” or “his struggle is mighty,” and more. The present story turns on the first of those possible meanings.<br></br>A name change often signifies a change in character. Jacob is no longer simply the “deceiver/supplanter” (27:36). Abraham and Sarah have their names changed permanently and consistently (Genesis 17); Jacob, on the other hand, will be called both Jacob and Israel after this name change.<br></br><i><b>“struggled with God.”</b></i> Or “…with divine beings” (compare Judges 13:22). It is not clear whether this statement is intended literally to describe the recent wrestling match, or figuratively in reference to Jacob’s general life circumstances.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="32:31"><b>Peniel—“For I have seen God face-to-face.”</b> Explaining the place name as if it meant “face of God” (<i>p’nei-el</i>), suggesting that Jacob understands his overnight struggle as a direct encounter with God. [Because the Bible—as in the ancient Near East generally—considers the actions of messengers to be largely inseparable from the principal who sent them, Jacob may perhaps be referring to an encounter with a divine messenger as agent. —<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="32:32"><b></b> Jacob leaves the encounter with a serious injury. He thus sets out to meet his brother while physically limping and vulnerable, but with new internal strength.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="32:33"><b>the people of Israel do not eat the thigh muscle.</b> This dietary restriction is not mentioned in the laws of <i>kashrut</i> in either Leviticus 11 or Deuteronomy 14:3-21. It is presented as a matter of ethnic identification rather than of ritual purity.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="33:1–2" ref="33:1"><div class="head2" id="ge_33.1-20">THE BROTHERS RECONCILE (33:1–20)
</div><b></b> After his encounter with God, Jacob turns back to the confrontation with his brother, Esau. He divides the women and children, situating the women most likely according to personal preference: maids and their children first, then Leah and her children, and then, Rachel and Joseph—his favorites—in back. The status of Jacob’s sons depends apparently upon their mothers’ favor with Jacob, not their birth order or even their personalities. Joseph is the only child specifically cited. These spatial and narrative details spotlight Jacob’s preference of Rachel, an attitude that later proves to undermine harmony within the household.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="33:5"><b></b> The narrator pointedly relates that Esau asks, “Who are these with you?” only after he has noticed “the women and the children.” Yet Jacob’s reply mentions only “the children,” not the women.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="33:11"><b>“Please accept my gift of blessing.”</b> Literally, “please take my blessing,” which suggests that Jacob is attempting to compensate for having appropriated Esau’s blessing twenty years earlier.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="33:14–15" ref="33:14"><b></b> Jacob wants reconciliation, but not closeness. He tells Esau that he will meet him in one place—but travels to another.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:1"><div class="head"><i>Dinah and Shechem</i>
</div><div class="head1">SEX AND SOCIAL STATUS (34:1-31)
</div><div class="tab-en">Dinah, acting independently and of her own initiative, goes out to visit “the women of the locality.” In the span of just two verses, the local Hivite prince, Shechem, spots Dinah, has sex with her, falls in love with her, and wants to marry her. Her brothers react violently and destroy Shechem and his city.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Dinah’s status and her standing in society steadily decline as the story progresses. She moves from fulfilling the proper role in the proper place (virgin-daughter in father’s house) to a socially ambiguous role with no proper corresponding physical place. Her story serves as a warning in the larger—and probably overriding—issue of the political and ethnic identity of the Israelites in relation to the other people in the land.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Throughout the story, Dinah’s location corresponds directly to her perceived position in society and illustrates the precarious state of the daughter in biblical Israel. Though she seems free to move about, she is not secure anywhere. One need only consider the plight of Jephthah’s daughter in Judges 11, the concubine in Judges 19, and the daughters of Shiloh in Judges 21, to get the message that women, or at least daughters, are vulnerable to calamity when they “go out.”
</div><div class="head2" id="ge_vv.1-4">RAPE? (34:1–4)
</div><div class="tab-en1">A crucial question for modern interpreters is whether or not Dinah was raped. When considering the modern concept of rape—characterized by an aggressive act and lack of mutual consent—there is little question as to what happens to Dinah; the author tells us that Shechem saw her, took her, lay with her, and humiliated her. To us, this string of verbs screams “rape” (and is in fact even translated that way in v. 2). The assumption made by most interpreters is that Dinah did not consent to the sexual act. However, the question of consent, so central to the modern notion of rape and of women’s rights in general, is entirely ignored in this text. Dinah’s consent is not the issue. The ambiguity of the Hebrew verbs describing Shechem’s actions toward Dinah compounds the difficulty of interpretation.
</div><div class="tab-en1">If we contemporary interpreters are sensitive to the ancient context in which the story was recorded, we need to entertain the possibility that there is a fundamental difference between our modern concept of rape and what may represent rape in the biblical text. In our society, forcing a woman to have sex against her will is seen as terrible both for its emotional and psychological consequences, and for the humiliation and debasement suffered by the woman as an individual. The Bible, even in its rape laws, was primarily concerned with the juridical and social-status consequences of the tort involved in sleeping with a virgin without either marrying her or compensating her father. As with adultery, the problem was not treated as an emotional or psychological one. When Amnon rapes Tamar in II Samuel 13, the violation that has taken place is made clear when Tamar begs Amnon not to reject her but to request her for his wife. It is his rejection subsequent to the sexual act that damages Tamar’s life the most, because as an unmarried non-virgin princess, she has completely lost status in her society. In contrast to Tamar, Dinah is not granted a voice in the story; instead, her body and life form a site for settling issues between men.
</div><div class="tab-en1">If Shechem marries Dinah after having sex with her, she would have full status as a wife in his household. The story, however, aims at excluding such a union with the other peoples in the land. Thus Jacob ignores his obligation to protect the women of his household when he does not subsequently negotiate Dinah’s marriage to Shechem. (For a different perspective on this episode, see Another View.)
</div><b>Dinah, Leah’s daughter.</b> Dinah is introduced as the daughter of Leah, the wife that Jacob did not want. (On the status of offspring as a function of Jacob’s favoring Rachel, see at 33:1–2.)<br></br>Dinah is referred to as “daughter” seven times in this story. See also at v. 4, s.v. “girl.”<br></br><i><b>went out to see the women of the locality.</b></i> Dinah goes out of her father’s house to a public space, literally “to see the daughters of the land.” Dinah seems free to leave, but she does so at her own risk. She is going out to “see” her peers, but she is ultimately “seen”—with dramatic consequences. Nowhere in the text is she criticized for her action.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:2"><b>Shechem.</b> The name both of the prince and of the settlement (today’s Nablus). In the book of Joshua, this locale becomes the site of a special covenant ceremony for the Israelites (Joshua 24). Later it rivaled Jerusalem; this rivalry may account for the hostility with which the city is portrayed in the present story.<br></br><i><b>he took her and lay her down and raped her.</b></i> Interpretive debates about the story and its import revolve around the meaning of the word <i>innah,</i> here rendered as “rape.” The meaning of the other verbs as well is both affected by, and in turn influences, how one interprets the actions involved in this episode.<br></br>Deuteronomy 22 contains several laws about sexual offenses with terminology similar to what appears here. From the usage in Deuteronomy one can conclude that <i>innah</i> means “violate,” not “rape” (22:23–24). The expression “he took hold of her” <i>is</i> apparently the one used for rape in Deuteronomy (22:25) as well in the Tamar/Amnon story (II Samuel 13:14)—and it is not used here in the present verse. Consequently, the word <i>innah</i> should not be translated as rape, and what happened to Dinah certainly should not be understood as an act of rape in the modern sense of the word. Rather, the term demonstrates in this passage, as elsewhere, a downward movement in a social sense, meaning to “debase” or “humiliate” (Genesis 16:6). Though an affront to the woman’s family, the term does not carry with it the psychological and emotional implications for the woman that the contemporary notion of rape suggests. In this particular text, the woman has no voice, and the narrator has no interest in whether or not she consented to the sexual act. Bear in mind that according to ancient Near Eastern mores, Dinah would have been considered to have been disgraced even if she had consented.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:4"><b>“girl.”</b> Heb. <i>yaldah;</i> literally, “a (female) child,” which suggests that she is rather young. Similar terms such as <i>bat</i> (daughter) and <i>naara</i> (girl or young woman) appear repeatedly in this passage (see at v. 1). Taken together, these descriptors suggest that Dinah’s youth was relevant to the events that follow.<br></br><i><b>“girl…wife.”</b></i> Heb. <i>yaldah…ishah.</i> The transition from childhood to adulthood (for <i>ishah</i> can also mean “woman”) is brought on by a change in status involving sexual relations.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:5"><div class="head2" id="ge_vv.5-24">BROTHERS’ INTERPRETATION: AN OUTRAGE AGAINST ISRAEL (34:5–24)<br></br>Jacob hears what has happened to Dinah and, somewhat uncharacteristically, waits until the return of his sons. There is irony here in that on the Canaanite side the son (Shechem) goes to his father (Hamor) to negotiate on his behalf, while Jacob remains silent throughout the entire story until v. 30, when he chastises his sons for having made trouble for him in his new land.
</div><b>defiled.</b> Heb. <i>timei</i>, indicating that Dinah’s status has changed for the worse. Other forms of this word are used in Leviticus for “pollution” or “impure,” a condition that can be temporary (as in 11:44; 15:31; 18:20). Something defiled can often be rendered pure with proper ritual purification. In the case of Dinah, it appears that marriage to Shechem could potentially change her status from “defiled” to “pure.”</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:7"><b>an outrage against Israel.</b> The sons are angry because of the “outrage against Israel.” The only “Israel” in this story is Jacob himself; but he is not the one outraged. Rather, it is his sons, the <i>B’nei Yisrael,</i> who are affected and who take action in response.<br></br><i><b>lying with Jacob’s daughter—such things were not done.</b></i> The reason Jacob’s sons give for their rage is clearly expressed. The “thing not to be done” is to have sex with Jacob’s daughter.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="34:8–17 Hamor now spoke with them" ref="34:8"><b></b> The negotiation occurs only among men. They alone discuss the details involved in changing Dinah’s status from unmarried virgin in her father’s house to married wife and future mother in her husband’s house. The negotiations as stated do not convey Dinah’s consent or desire. It is Shechem’s wish that was expressed (v. 4), and it is his father’s negotiation that now takes place on his behalf.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:12"><b>‘‘girl.”</b> Shechem here refers to Dinah as a naara rather than as <i>yaldah</i> (child, girl); see at v. 4.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:13"><b>deceptively.</b> Heb. <i>b’mirmah;</i> here this word is applied to “Jacob’s sons,” a reminder that earlier it referred to Jacob himself (see at 27:35). On subterfuge as a recourse for both women and men who face abuses of authority, see at 27:1–28:9 (introduction).</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="34:14–24" ref="34:14"><b></b> Entering into a binding marriage requires both negotiation and sex (not necessarily in that order); so Dinah and Shechem are already halfway there. For their part of the negotiation, the brothers tell Shechem that they cannot give Dinah to him in marriage until he is circumcised. In a surprising move, Shechem is able to convince the males of the town to become circumcised in order to benefit from contact with Jacob’s family.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:26"><div class="head2" id="ge_vv.25-31">BROTHERS’ REVENGE (34:25–31)<br></br>Rather than framing their sister’s loss of virginity in the context of marriage, “Jacob’s sons” had arranged marriage deceptively (v. 13). Rather than following through with the terms they had negotiated, Simeon and Levi—now also identified as “Dinah’s brothers” (v. 25)—exact revenge.
</div><b>taking Dinah from Shechem’s house.</b> After her initial encounter with Shechem, Dinah does not return to her father’s house. But in Shechem’s house, her status is equally problematic as she is not officially his wife. An alien in a foreign household, lacking a negotiated marriage and children, Dinah is literally on the social fringe. Her removal from Shechem’s house at this point in the story does nothing to improve the situation. With a voided marriage but the sexual status of wife, there is no acceptable place for her in society.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="34:28–29" ref="34:28"><b></b> The brothers kill all the men but spare women and children, taking them captive instead.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:30"><b>“You have made trouble for me.”</b> Jacob chastises his sons for their violent response (compare 49:5–6), predicting the destruction of his own household as a result.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="34:31"><b>“Should he then have been allowed to treat our sister like a whore?”</b> The brothers choose to view the offer of money in compensation for Dinah’s virginity not as an elevation of her status, but rather as a statement about Dinah’s availability as a prostitute. Their explanation for their behavior makes clear that Dinah herself is not culpable. This position stands in stark contrast to tendencies in the ancient (and modern) world to blame the woman for the family’s shame.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-en1" ref="35:4"><div class="head"><i>Israel and B’nei Yisrael</i>

</div><b></b> Jacob’s household buries all the foreign gods and the earrings from their ears—presumably also the <i>t’rafim</i> (household gods) that Rachel stole from her father (31:19). The reason for specifying earrings is not clear. In Exodus 32 (the Golden Calf story) and Judges 8:24–27, earrings are used to fashion an idol.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="35:8"><b>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse.</b> See at 24:59. <b><i>died.</i></b> Rebekah’s own death is never mentioned, so it is strange that her nurse’s death is worth noting.<br></br><i><b>the Oak.</b></i> Presumably a tree near Beth El that served as a landmark. A more famous Deborah— the prophet—is also associated with a tree, for she would sit under a palm and render judgment (Judges 4:4–5).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="35:10"><b>“Jacob are you called no more, for Israel is your name!”</b> The story in vv. 9–15 is a doublet on the name change from Jacob to Israel (32:17–33), one of several episodes in the Torah that appear twice in similar form (see the sister/wife story of Abraham and Sarah in Genesis 12 and 20).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="35:17"><div class="head2" id="ge_35.16-21">RACHEL’S SECOND SON AND HER DEATH (35:16–21)<br></br>On the road from Beth El, Rachel dies in childbirth. Earlier, when Laban had charged Jacob with stealing the household gods (Genesis 31), Jacob had countered, “the one with whom you find your gods shall not live” (31:32). It is unclear whether according to the text’s composer(s) Rachel’s death is an unwitting result of Jacob’s rash curse (after all, Laban did not find his household gods). Deaths during childbirth were a widespread phenomenon in the ancient world. Rachel’s demise may implicitly be connected to her former barrenness and desperate attempts to have a child. Ironically, the woman who so longed for children dies in childbirth.<br></br>This is one of only two stories in the Bible about such deaths. In the other (I Samuel 4:18–22), a woman’s premature labor is triggered by the shock of Israel’s defeat in war and of the deaths of her father-in-law and husband; and she, like Rachel, dies after naming the child (but see at 30:3).
</div><b>“Don’t be afraid; this one, too, will be a son for you.”</b> Rachel—who embedded her longing for another son already in the name of her first son, Joseph (30:24)—is dying; but her midwife tries to comfort her with the knowledge that she is giving up her life for a living (male) child. A similar attempt at comfort is recorded in I Samuel 4:18.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="35:18"><b>Ben-oni,</b> An ambiguous name that can mean “son of my suffering” or “son of my strength.”<br></br><i><b>Benjamin.</b></i> That is, “son of the right [hand].” Perhaps Jacob is changing Rachel’s sense of the futility of her life into an affirmation of her importance to Jacob as his favorite wife.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="35:19"><b>buried on the road to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem.</b> According to I Samuel 10:2, the tomb of Rachel was in the territory of (or at the boundary of) Benjamin, as might be expected, and not near Bethlehem, which is in Judah. In Jeremiah 31:15, Rachel weeps for her children in Ramah, a city in Benjamin. The later status accorded to Bethlehem under David’s influence might account for the present note that Rachel’s tomb was near Bethlehem. According to the biblical accounts, Rachel is the only one of the four matriarchs not buried in the cave of Machpelah, purchased by Abraham for Sarah (Genesis 23)—which is also Jacob’s final resting place (50:13). Such perpetual separation is sadly ironic, given his intense love for Rachel.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="35:20"><b></b> Just as he had set up a pillar to commemorate his encounter with God (35:14), Jacob sets up one to mark Rachel’s grave. Although no emotions are expressed here, on his deathbed Jacob will poignantly recall this loss and burial (48:7).<br></br> <i><b>22. Reuben went and lay with his father’s concubine Bilhah.</b></i> Sleeping with one’s father’s wife was a great offense (Leviticus 18:8; 20:11). It is possible that this is why Bilhah is called a concubine <i>(pilegesh</i>) here, while she appears as “wife” in other instances (see Genesis 37:2). Intercourse with the father’s concubine, although a less severe offense than with his wife, is apparently tantamount to a declaration of rebellion against the father. When Adonijah asks for Abishag, the woman who shared David’s bed when he was old (I Kings 1:1–4), Solomon takes this as a bid for the throne, and has Adonijah executed for treason (I Kings 2:13–25). Note also Absalom’s sleeping with David’s concubines as a sign of displacing his father, David (II Samuel 16:22–23).<br></br><i><b>and Israel heard.</b></i> As with Dinah in Genesis 34, Jacob takes no immediate action. However, he will bypass Reuben for the birthright in his deathbed blessing (Genesis 49:3–4).</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="36:40–43" ref="36:40"><div class="head2" id="ge_35.22-26">JACOB’S WIVES AND CHILDREN (35:22–26)<br></br>The summary list of Jacob’s twelve sons is given according to their mothers. Dinah, and any other possible daughters, are omitted. The mothers’ mention presumably indicates the relative status of the sons. The mothers are listed in a different order than seen previously. In 33:2, fearing Esau’s wrath, Jacob had placed the maids Bilhah and Zilpah and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and her son closest to the rear. That order reflects their importance to Jacob, from the most to the least expendable. Here, the women’s order corresponds to the order in which Jacob married them: Leah; Rachel; Rachel’s maid, Bilhah; and Leah’s maid, Zilpah.
</div><div class="head2" id="ge_35.27-29">ISAAC’S DEATH (35:27–29)<br></br>Jacob returns to see his father Isaac (who may have been on his deathbed for two decades; 27:1–2, 31:41). Nothing is said about his mother Rebekah, whose death is never reported. Isaac dies and is buried by both Esau and Jacob. This brief report recalls that of Abraham’s death and burial (25:8–10). In both cases estranged brothers come together to bury their father. Nothing is recorded as to whether they also bury their differences.
</div><div class="head2" id="ge_36.1-43">THE LINE OF ESAU (36:1–43)<br></br>This section provides the genealogy of Esau’s line. Esau’s Canaanite wives figure prominently. While the women in Jacob’s list above are mentioned only in connection with their sons, Esau’s wives are identified by the name and ethnicity of their fathers. Esau acquires power by establishing a series of marriage alliances corresponding to the later relationship of the nation Edom with these other nations. Here the movement of women from the house of their father to the house of their husband serves to establish political and social relations between two groups of previously unrelated men.<br></br>The passage’s inconsistent genealogies must have been compiled from a variety of sources. The names of Esau’s wives in vv. 2–3 do not correspond to the names of his wives given earlier (26:34, 28:9). Prominent in this list are wives Adah, Basemath, Timna, Oholibamah, and Zibeon.<br></br> <i><b>39. Mehetabel.</b></i> [The mention of this woman’s mother and her maternal grandparent is unusual, especially since nothing further is known about her— and even less is known about her husband. —<i>Ed</i>.]
</div><b></b> The concluding list of clans in Esau’s line, here identified as Edom, Israel’s neighbor, includes women—Timna and Oholibamah—each as the head of a clan.<br></br><i>—Shawna Dolansky</i><br/><i>Risa Levitt Kohn</i><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div class="right1"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="chap" id="ano8-1"><div class="tab-en">V<small>AYISHLACH BEGINS AND ENDS</small> with references to Esau, Jacob’s twin brother. At the beginning of this parashah, it is to Esau whom Jacob sends messengers (32:4), who return with a report that he is on the move, coming to meet his brother (32:7). The parashah concludes with Esau going to another region “because of his brother Jacob” (36:6–8) and with Esau’s genealogical line, the Edomite people (36:9–42).
</div><div class="tab-en1">Esau is thus highlighted in this parashah by being the subject of the beginning and ending units. Even so, Jacob is clearly the more important character—a fate Esau has had to endure from early on. Esau is a touching figure because no matter how hard he tries, he cannot measure up to his younger brother who—though not always honest and fair in his dealings—outmaneuvers him.
</div><div class="tab-en1">What distinguishes the two brothers? How to account for Jacob’s prominence over Esau? The difference between the two begins with their mother’s decision and continues with their choices of marriage partners. God informs Rebekah—not Isaac—about their yet-to-be-born twins that “the older shall serve the younger” (25:23). Rebekah acts on this information by supporting Jacob at the expense of her other son.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Then Esau marries two Hittite women, causing his parents distress (26:34–35), whereas Jacob is sent (at his mother’s instigation) to find a wife from her own people (27:46–28:5), which he does (29:21–30). Attempting to please his parents, Esau tries again by marrying Mahalath, also a cousin like Jacob’s wives; she is the daughter of Ishmael, his father’s brother (28:8–9).
</div><div class="tab-en1">The Dinah story occurs in the middle, in between the references to Esau that frame this parashah. After Shechem—a Canaanite prince—rapes Jacob’s daughter, Jacob is indecisive about their marriage (34:5). Dinah’s two oldest full brothers, however, respond by killing all the Shechemites so that the marriage between Dinah and Shechem does not happen, thereby keeping their sister from marrying the people in the land.

</div><div class="tab-en1">Genesis 34 reaffirms the importance of marrying the right people within the family. Together these incidents illustrate the importance of mother and wife, and not only father, in determining a person’s destiny.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano8-2"><div class="tab-en"><i><b>his eleven children</b></i> (32:23). Benjamin was not yet born, but didn’t Jacob already have twelve children? Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 76.9 and 80.4 suggest that Jacob hid Dinah in a box so that Esau would not see her and seek to marry her. On that basis, Jacob is castigated for lack of compassion toward his brother; as Rashi explains, perhaps by such a marriage, Esau would have returned to a path of good (on 32:23).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>Dinah, Leah’s daughter…went out</b></i> (34:1). <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 80.1 (also 8.12, 18.2, 45.5) and JT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 2:6 (20d) are among numerous sources that judge both Dinah and Leah harshly based on this verse. Both are seen to act inappropriately for women simply by going out unattended—Dinah here, and Leah when she likewise “went out” to inform Jacob, “I am the one you will bed [tonight]” (30:16).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>to see the women of the locality</b></i> (34:1). <i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 38 claims that they were a ruse, sent by Shechem to play timbrels outside Dinah’s tent, in order to lure her outside—where he could lay hold of her.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>then, taking Dinah</b></i> (34:26). Dinah is mentioned only once more in Torah, among Jacob’s descendants in 46:15. What became of her? In <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 80.11, Rabbi Huna puts into Dinah’s mouth the words of Tamar—King David’s daughter who was raped by her half-brother Amnon: “Where will I carry my shame…?” (II Samuel 13:13); he suggests that Dinah agreed to leave Shechem’s house only after her brother Simeon promised to marry her himself. Thus—based on her involvement with Shechem—Dinah is identified as the otherwise unnamed “Canaanite woman” who was the mother of Simeon’s son Saul (46:10). It was also taught that when she died, Simeon buried her in Canaan.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">Another tradition found in <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 19.12 (also 57.4, 76.9, 80.4) and BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 15b, among other sources, is that Dinah became the wife of Job. Some versions of this tradition view Dinah’s subsequent marriage to a non-Israelite (namely, Job) as part of Jacob’s punishment for having withheld her from Esau (see the first entry, above). Alternatively, <i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer</i> 38 states that Dinah became pregnant when raped by Shechem, and she bore a daughter. Afraid of the shame that the presence of this child would bring on their community, Dinah’s brothers sought to kill the infant. Jacob, however, put an amulet with the name of God around the girl’s neck and sent her away; she was taken by the archangel Michael to Egypt, where she was adopted by a childless Egyptian priest and raised as his daughter. Dinah’s daughter, “Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On” (Genesis 41:45), later became Joseph’s wife. A further embellishment on this legend tells the story as follows: Joseph was exceedingly handsome, and when he went out, women would throw jewelry to attract his notice. Asenath tossed her amulet and when Joseph saw it, he realized their relationship and married her (<i>Chizz’kuni</i> to 41:45).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died…and was buried…under the…Oak of Weeping</b></i> (35:8). The word <i>bachut,</i> “weeping,” is similar to the plural term <i>b’chiyot,</i> “weepings,” suggesting to the Rabbis that <i>two</i> deaths were being mourned here: the death of Deborah, and the death of Rebekah—an event not otherwise mentioned in the Torah. According to <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 81.5, this is why the next verse (35:9) relates that <i>God appeared to Jacob…and blessed him</i>: God performed the kindness of visiting and comforting Jacob while he mourned his mother. But why is Rebekah’s death not related directly? Midrash <i>Tanchuma, Ki Teitzei</i> 4, explains that it was impossible to have an honorable funeral for her. Abraham was dead; Isaac, blind and weakened, could not leave his tent; and Jacob had gone abroad and could not return in time. Only Esau remained, and the continued ill feeling between him and his mother made it unlikely that he would come. Because Rebekah’s life ended in such a lonely way, the Torah hints at her passing only obliquely (see also the medieval commentator Ramban on 35:8).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>as her life was leaving her…she named him Benoni, but his father called him Benjamin</b></i> (35:18). Commentators generally agree that by the word <i>oni,</i> Rachel meant “my pain” or “my sorrow.” Rabbi Moses ben Nachman (1194–1270)—usually known as “Nachmanides” or by his initials as “Ramban”— notes here that another meaning of <i>on</i> is “strength,” as in 49:3, in which Jacob blesses Reuben as “first fruit of my vigor (<i>reishit oni).”</i> So too <i>y’min,</i> the right hand, stands for strength in the biblical world. Thus, Jacob does not actually change the name given by Rachel—for all Jacob’s children bear names given to them by their mothers—but rather “translates” it to its most positive interpretation.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano8-3"><div class="tab-en">A<small>FTER TWENTY YEARS</small>, Jacob is coming home. Anticipating that the reunion with the brother he cheated all those years ago will be disastrous, he sends messengers laden with presents ahead to his brother. But just to be on the safe side, he divides his camp in order to minimize the losses should he come under attack. The story continues: “That same night, he got up, took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven children, and crossed at a ford of the Jabbok [river].…Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him” (32:23–25). The nocturnal wrestler wounds and blesses him and gives him a new name—our name: Yisrael, one who wrestles with God.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Jacob’s wrestling with God is a powerful image and legacy. We never know with whom Jacob is wrestling: is it himself, his conscience, his brother, God, or all of these parts of himself and of his life? Jacob names the place Peniel, meaning “Face of God,” for, as he states, “I have seen God face-to-face” (32:31). Somehow, alone, separated from his “two wives” and his “eleven children,” Jacob discovers the face of God in his adversary—and Jacob is blessed.
</div><div class="tab-en1" style="margin-top:1em;">Eleven children cross the river? But Jacob already at this point has twelve children. What about Dinah, his daughter? What happened to her? Rashi, quoting a midrash, explains: “He placed her in a chest and locked her in.” While many commentaries understand that by locking Dinah in a box Jacob intends to protect her from marrying his brother Esau, we know the truth of the story. Hiding Dinah—locking her up—is a powerful image about silencing a woman. And that silence echoes loudly through the rest of the Torah.
</div><div class="tab-en1">What happens next? Dinah gets raped (Genesis 34). In an ultimate act of silencing, the commentaries understand Dinah’s rape as Jacob’s punishment for withholding her from Esau. Dinah’s rape is <i>Jacob’s</i> punishment? What about Dinah? What has she done? How does she feel? Our text is silent. We only know what her brothers and father think: that she has been defiled (34:5–7), that she must not be treated as a whore (34:31). No one in the Torah or the midrashic accounts asks her what she wants, what she needs, or how she can be comforted.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">Her silence is loud enough to reverberate through the generations. We hear it in the reports of other fathers who perceive their daughter’s rape as their dishonor, their punishment. Fortunately for Dinah, in Genesis the blame and punishment fall entirely on the perpetrator and his people, not on her. Other women are not as lucky. In 1998, in Pakistan, Arbab Khatoon was raped by three men in a village in Jacobabad district. She was murdered seven hours later. According to local residents, she was killed by her relatives for bringing dishonour to the family by going to the police. In 1999, Lal Jamilla Mandokhel, a 16-year-old mentally retarded girl, was reportedly raped several times by a junior clerk of the local government department of agriculture in a hotel in Parachinar, Pakistan. The girl’s uncle filed a complaint about the incident with police—who took the accused into protective custody but then handed over the girl to her tribe. The elders decided that she had brought shame to her tribe and that the honor could only be restored by her death; she was killed in front of a tribal gathering.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Similar stories are reported not only in Pakistan but also in Bangladesh, Great Britain, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Pakistan, Morocco, Sweden, Turkey, Uganda—as well as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. No wonder women are silent!
</div><div class="tab-en1">This outrage is only part of a much larger problem of violence against women. For example, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund <small>(UNICEF),</small> more than five thousand brides die annually in India because their dowries are considered insufficient. Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, says that “in countries where Islam is practiced, they’re called honor killings, but dowry deaths and so-called crimes of passion have a similar dynamic in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable.” The practice, she said, “goes across cultures and across religions.” In the few cases when public outcry around the world and international pressure were used, a woman’s life was spared. But stories that capture the headlines do not begin to address the scope and range of the problem.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Another form that violence takes is sexual slavery and human trafficking, which even happens in Israel. According to a recent Knesset report, thousands of women are illegally smuggled into Israel and sold into sexual slavery. These young women—typically in their early twenties—are raped, abused, incarcerated and threatened, “servicing” 15–25 clients over 14–18 hours a day, 7 days a week. The women become indentured slaves with an ever-growing debt to their owners. Israeli men from all walks of life pay approximately a million visits to brothels per month and the profits from this illicit activity are estimated at $750 million annually. Sexual slavery and human trafficking remain a global problem, taking place in nearly every corner of the world. It is estimated that 600,000–800,000 people—mostly women and children—are trafficked across borders worldwide every year. (For ways to get information—and to get involved in this issue—please contact the Task Force on Human Trafficking through its Web site.)
</div><div class="tab-en1">We hear Dinah’s silence as well in the challenges to reproductive rights happening right now in the United States. If Dinah were raped and became pregnant while living in South Dakota in 2007, she might not be able to get an abortion.
</div><div class="tab-en1">What happens to Dinah in the aftermath of her ordeal? We do not know. We never hear from her, just as we may never hear from the women and girls in our generation who are victims of violence and whose voices are not heard. But the legacy of Jacob as Israel, the one who wrestles, demands that we confront the shadowy parts of ourselves and our world—and not passively ignore these facts. The feminist educator Nelle Morton urged women to hear each other “into speech.” Dinah’s story challenges us to go even further and be also the voices for all of our sisters.
