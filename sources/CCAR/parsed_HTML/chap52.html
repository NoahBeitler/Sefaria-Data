<div class="chap1"><small>DEUTERONOMY 31:1–30
</small><i>The Oral and the Written: Words of Encouragement and Warning
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYEILECH</small> (“[he] went”) is the shortest portion in the Torah, consisting of only thirty verses. It begins with Moses standing before the Israelites in the plains of Moab, just across the Jordan River from the Promised Land. He delivers an encouraging message to Israel (31:1–13), in which he assures the people that although he is about to die, God will lead them into the Land, wiping out any obstacles in their path. To reinforce Joshua’s legitimacy as their new leader, Moses appoints him in front of all Israel.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses then writes down the Teaching (<i>torah</i>) and instructs the priests and elders regarding future public readings of the written text. As in 29:9–10, the text makes the inclusive nature of the covenant explicit, specifying that men, women, children, and strangers are to listen to and learn from God’s Teaching (31:12).
</div><div class="tab-enin">In the second part of the parashah (vv. 14–23), God begins to speak, delivering a darkly pessimistic message. God anticipates that immediately after Moses’ death, the people will go astray by worshiping other gods. As a result, Moses must write down the words of a poem as witness against the people.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Finally, Moses again speaks to the people (vv. 24–30); but now, as if infected by God’s disappointment, Moses too predicts misfortune in Israel’s future. In addition, repeatedly the parashah emphasizes the transmission of God’s teaching as a written text.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Regarding the treatment of women in this parashah, they are mentioned explicitly only once (v. 12), although they are included implicitly as part of the “people.” Nevertheless, readers might consider a number of questions sparked by the parashah:
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="blist">•What are the repercussions of having the tale narrated by a single dominant male voice, that of Moses? The story as told is shaped by the teller and his particular interests; and, in turn, this story will shape the type of community that Israel will become. What if, instead, the story were to be told from the perspective of a female figure, such as Miriam? What might a female narrator have considered crucial if she were asked to retell the events of the wilderness journey? What vision of community might she propose?
</div><div class="blist">•Moses passes the reins of communal leadership from himself to Joshua. Who would have been a fitting successor to his sister, Miriam—the prophet and leader who died not long beforehand (Numbers 20:1)?
</div><div class="blist">•The depiction of Moses writing down the <i>torah</i> (which in this context refers to the teachings in Deuteronomy) prompts speculation: Could a female author have written a biblical book? While answers to these questions remain largely conjectural, the parashah makes one thing quite clear: women as well as men must hear and study the Torah and apply it to their lives.

</div><div class="tab-en">Moses reminds the people of God’s plans to take them across the Jordan into the Promised Land, accompanied by Joshua. Once there, the people are to gather and read the <i>torah</i> aloud every seventh year during the festival of Sukkot.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.1-5">MOSES PREPARES THE PEOPLE FOR GOD AND JOSHUA TO TAKE OVER (31:1–5)
</div><div class="tab-enin">Unable to enter the Promised Land, Moses reassures the people of success and appoints Joshua to take the lead.
</div><b>Moses went.</b> The verse suggests that Moses seeks out the people in order to deliver his message; time is of the essence since he knows that he is about to die.<br></br><i><b>spoke…things.</b></i> Heb. <i>va-ydaber…d’varim,</i> where both the verb and its object derive from the same root (<i>d-b-r</i>). This language echoes the opening verse of Deuteronomy, where the two forms of this root also appear together: “These are the words (<i>d’varim</i>) that Moses addressed (<i>dibber</i>) to all Israel” (1:1). Soon, at the end of his long series of speeches, Moses will write down these precious words as his legacy to Israel (v. 9). At Deuteronomy’s end, the oral and the written become inextricably linked.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:2"><b>I can no longer be active.</b> The Hebrew idiom for a lack of physical motion in an aged Moses is more suggestive—literally “I am no longer able to go out or come in.” The image of movement is reinforced by God’s next words, reminding Moses that he cannot cross over the Jordan and enter the land.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:3"><b>your God יהוה who will cross over before you.</b> Moses turns from his own fate to the people’s, who shortly will leave him behind. Poignantly he speaks of “your God,” not including himself in the address. Since Moses will not cross the Jordan (v. 2), God and Joshua will cross before the Israelites (v. 3) to ensure victory as they settle the land.<br></br><b>Joshua is the one who shall cross before you, as יהוה has spoken.</b> The syntax of this phrase is odd, forcing the English translation to add dashes to make sense of the sentence. The prior sentence states that God’s destruction of the nations will end with Israel’s dispossessing them. Then, almost as an afterthought, Joshua is introduced. This clearly tacked-on phrase suggests an editorial insertion to draw attention to the role that Joshua will assume. The verse reflects a tension between God’s actions on our behalf and the human means by which those actions are accomplished.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:4"> About to die, Moses retells what happened in the past. As in <i>parashat D’varim,</i> he shapes Israel’s memories of the wilderness journey in order to teach lessons pertinent to the present moment. (For speculation on how a female narrator might have reshaped the story, see the introduction to this parashah.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:6"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.6-8">MOSES ENCOURAGES THE PEOPLE AND JOSHUA: “BE STRONG AND RESOLUTE” (31:6–8)<br></br>These three verses present the reader with an identifiable section that shows signs of careful editing through the use of repetition and inversion to make a highly political point to the Israelite audience. Verse 6 contains four clauses that claim a cause-and-effect relationship, stressing that the people Israel can be strong and free of fear because God is with them and will not let them down. Verses 7–8 include language nearly identical to that of Moses when he commissions Joshua. One noteworthy difference between vv. 7–8 and v. 6 is the insertion of Joshua’s name as the one who will lead the people along with God. Because he assumes this role, Israel should accept his equally important function as the one who divides the land among the tribes. The politics of succession as well as the necessary persuasion to secure Joshua’s legitimacy are in play here. The deft weaving together of similar language in each passage signals that God approves the arrangement.
</div><b>Be strong and resolute.</b> This expression of encouragement, particularly used in the context of war, appears three times in this parashah (also vv. 7 and 23) and four times in Joshua 1 as the people prepare to enter the land (vv. 6, 7, 9, 18).<br></br><i><b>forsake you.</b></i> Here and in v. 8, Moses assures the people and Joshua that God will not forsake or abandon them. The same verbal root <i>(e-z-b)</i> is used later when God foreshadows that Israel will forsake God (v. 16), which in turn will result in God forsaking them (v. 17). In Isaiah 49:14–15, the identical verb is used when the people in exile express their anxiety that God has deserted them. In response, the prophet reassures them by means of a rhetorical question that compares God to a mother: “Can a mother forget her babe, or stop loving the child of her womb? Even these could forget, but I could not forget you.”</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:7"><b>Then Moses called Joshua.</b> Just as Joshua prepares to take the lead after Moses’ death, his brother Aaron also has a successor, Eleazar (Numbers 20:26). While no one is designated to succeed their sister Miriam, Deborah would be a fitting choice. Deborah, like Miriam (Exodus 15:20), is called a prophet (Judges 4:4); and she is praised as “Mother in Israel” (Judges 5:7), a title that most likely indicates her role as a leader during the period of the Judges. Also, just as Miriam sings a song of victory and praise after crossing the Sea of Reeds (Exodus 15:20–21), so too does Deborah sing a song of praise after the defeat of Sisera (Judges 5). It is intriguing that both of these two poems, which are thought to be among the oldest compositions in the Bible, are associated with women. (On women as singers of victory songs and other poetic compositions, see at Exodus 15:1–19 and Deuteronomy 32:1–43.)<br></br><i><b>in the sight of all Israel.</b></i> That is, Joshua must be seen and accepted as the legitimate successor to Moses.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:9"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.9-13">MOSES GIVES INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PUBLIC READING OF THE TORAH (31:9–13)<br></br>The text now shifts to a description of how Moses wrote down the Teaching and ensured its annual public reading.
</div><b>Moses wrote down this Teaching.</b> Here and in v. 24, we have explicit mention of Moses writing the Teaching (<i>torah</i>). Elsewhere in Deuteronomy, the written <i>torah</i> is discussed without attributing its writing to Moses (see 17:18; 27:8). Thus the later tradition that Moses wrote the entire Torah may begin with this parashah.<br></br>In certain passages in Exodus, the word <i>torah</i> refers to divine precepts authoritative for the community (for instance, see <i>torat YHVH</i> in Exodus 13:9). In Leviticus and Numbers, the term typically refers to priestly instructions, either oral or written on separate scrolls that priests keep to themselves; in such cases, the word often is translated as “ritual” (see at Leviticus 6:2). In Deuteronomy, <i>torah</i> generally refers to “this Teaching,” meaning the book of Deuteronomy or perhaps its legal parts (see at 1:5; 17:18; 27:3); it designates a written text that becomes central to Israel’s life as a community, for it contains God’s rules for all of Israel. As many scholars note, Deuteronomy lays the foundation for Judaism’s becoming a religion of the book.<br></br>Later biblical books speak of the <i>torah</i> of Moses (for instance, Joshua 8:31; 23:6; I Kings 2:3; II Kings 14:6; 23:25; Ezra 7:6; Nehemiah 8:1). These references to the Teaching of Moses appear in times of instability or crisis, including a transition in rule, a moment of religious or political reform, or the return of the exiles from Babylon. Thus the Teaching <i>(torah)</i> of Moses provides guidance and an anchor for Israel.<br></br>No such explicit association exists between a woman and a work of the Hebrew Bible. One possible comparison is Song of Songs. Although attributed to Solomon, this biblical book reproduces the voice of a woman as its chief speaker or singer. In addition, the book of Ruth could have been written by a woman, given the central relationship of the daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law and the dominance of female economic concerns.<br></br><i><b>and gave it to the priests, sons of Levi.</b></i> According to Deuteronomy, levitical priests are in charge of teaching the <i>torah</i> to the people.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:10"><b>at the Feast of Booths.</b> Jeffrey Tigay suggests a practical reason for reading the Teaching at this time. Since Sukkot marks the end of the agricultural cycle, the people have some leisure and, depending on the harvest’s success, a sense of security and gratitude. As a consequence, Sukkot in Jerusalem would have been the best-attended of the festivals, giving the Jerusalem priests both a large audience and ample time to read the Teaching publicly. He estimates that all of Deuteronomy could be read in three or four hours (<i>Deuteronomy</i>, 1996, pp. 291–92). Note the specific mention of women in 16:13–14 among those instructed to celebrate Sukkot.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:11"><b>in the place that [God] will choose.</b> Deuteronomy is a book of religious vision and reform. An unnamed central site (presumably the Temple in Jerusalem) is to replace the many high places and cultic sites found in Judah at that time (see at 12:2–14). The public reading of the scroll would reinforce the centrality of the Temple in Jerusalem as God’s Chosen Place.<br></br><i><b>read this Teaching aloud.</b></i> The <i>torah</i> is preserved and written down, but it is read aloud to the many who either do not have a copy or would not be able to read it. In narratives about the later periods in Israel’s history, such a public reading is said to have occurred during the period of intense religious reform under Josiah (II Kings 23) and after the return from exile, when Ezra reads the Torah aloud (Nehemiah 8). Nehemiah 8:2 emphasizes that the audience is composed of “men and women and all who could listen with understanding” (also v. 3).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:12"><b>men, women, children, and the strangers.</b> The list suggests as inclusive a group as possible; knowledge of God’s teachings is open to everyone and expected of everyone.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:14"><div class="head2a"><i>God Rebukes Israel</i> (31:14–23)
</div><div class="tab-en">In comparison to the foreboding message we are about to read, Deuteronomy 30 (in the prior parashah) exhibited a more compassionate tone and a more forgiving God. The contrast suggests the purposeful preservation of two different traditions concerning Moses’ last speeches, the first offering a vision of God in harmony with Israel and the second presenting a warning of estrangement and disaster caused by the people’s behavior.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.14-15">MOSES AND JOSHUA MEET GOD IN THE TENT OF MEETING (31:14–15)
</div><div class="tab-enin">God repeats what Moses announced to the people in v. 2, the fact of his impending death. In preparation for the change of leadership, God summons Moses and Joshua to the Tent of Meeting.
</div><b>Tent of Meeting.</b> Heb. <i>ohel mo’ed,</i> which refers to the tent located outside of the camp where God earlier appeared as a pillar of cloud in order to speak to Moses “face to face” and to Joshua as his attendant (see at Exodus 33:7–11). This is the same tent where God spoke directly to Miriam and to her brother Aaron (Numbers 12:4–9).<br></br><i><b>that I may instruct him.</b></i> God now speaks directly to Joshua; Moses is not included.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:15"><b>in a pillar of cloud.</b> God often appears to Moses, and at times to the people, behind a veil of some kind, shielding the observer from a direct view of God’s manifestation.

Just as earlier repentance and reconciliation are depicted as reciprocal (see at 30:1–10), so here are rebellion and rejection. The core message of this section is that since the people will abandon God, God will abandon the people (vv. 16–17; see at v. 6).
</div><b>go astray after.</b> Literally, “go whoring after.” Here and in several prophetic books (see Hosea 2; Jeremiah 3:1; Ezekiel 16, 23), prostitution is used as a metaphor for adultery and apostasy. The betrayal involved in adultery forms the basis of an analogy to vividly express God’s sense of betrayal when Israel worships other gods. This comparison fits with the broader conception of the relationship between God and Israel as a marriage, a metaphor that conveys both the love that binds the metaphoric husband and wife, as well as God’s deep disappointment when Israel turns to “alien gods” (see also at 5:9).<br></br><i><b>alien gods.</b></i> This expression refers to Canaanite gods. Yet in v. 3, Moses announces that God will destroy the nations (and presumably their idols) once they cross into the land of Canaan. This contradiction anticipates the tension found in the books of Joshua and Judges between the claim to have wiped out the local inhabitants and the fact that Israel repeatedly interacts with those already in the land. The contradiction seems to suggest that a widespread destruction of other peoples did not in fact occur (see also at 2:34; 7:1–5; 7:24; 12:29–31). Rather, Israel came into being in the midst of other cultures and widely and creatively adapted some of their practices and ideas into Israelite religious life.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:17"><b>hide My countenance from them.</b> Here and in v. 18, this common biblical image (see, for instance, Isaiah 54:8; Psalm 30:8) depicts the remoteness of God’s presence (literally “face”). The expression here suggests profound divine alienation from the people.<br></br><i><b>“Surely it is because our God is not in our midst.”</b></i> The people will blame their troubles on God’s absence, equated here with the denial of divine protection and sustenance.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:19"><b>Therefore, write down this poem.</b> God’s response to Moses’ impending absence is to demand a written text. Some interpreters understand the poem to serve as an accusation against the people in the generations to come, preventing them from misconstruing the past. In other words, the poem will testify to the fact that God abandoned them for just cause (Jeffrey Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, p. 295). Others have reinterpreted this verse to understand the poem not as a witness <i>against</i> Israel, but as a witness <i>on behalf of</i> Israel, reminding God “not to judge the people Israel harshly in the future, for God was aware of their nature (v. 27) and chose them nonetheless” (attributed to Rabbi Meir “Malbim” in David Lieber, ed., <i>Etz Hayim,</i> 2001, p. 1177).</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="31:20–21" ref="31:20"> These verses reiterate God’s charge in vv. 16–19, but with an added accusation against Israel.

</div><div class="tab-en">Deuteronomy vacillates between the visionary rhetoric of promise-and-fulfillment and of its opposite, reproach-and-despair. So, too, does Moses. After his death, the people will remember him through his words and the written text.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.24-27">MOSES INSTRUCTS THE LEVITES TO PLACE THE TEACHING IN THE ARK (31:24–27)
</div><div class="tab-enin">In v. 19, God instructs Moses to write down the poem, a task completed in v. 22. Now the focus reverts to the writing of the Teaching <i>(torah).</i> Verses 24–25 appear to be a resumption and repetition of v. 9, which describes how Moses finished writing the <i>torah</i> and gave it to the Levites. This section mentions only the Teaching—not the poem—which strongly suggests that vv. 16–22 (God’s angry speech and the anticipation of the poem as a witness against Israel) were inserted into the account of Moses’ completion of the writing of the Teaching. What links the two episodes is the importance and use of the written text. What separates them are their respective tones: optimistically hopeful versus starkly pessimistic.
</div><b>Take this book of Teaching and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant.</b> In contrast to the priestly description of the magnificent ark overlaid with gold found in Exodus and Leviticus (see at Exodus 25:10–22), Deuteronomy 31 values something else: an ark next to which is placed the written Teaching. Ancient Near Eastern political treaties were stored in containers and deposited in temples (see also at 10:5).<br></br><i><b>let it remain there as a witness against you.</b></i> This clause forms another linkage between the two disparate passages of Deuteronomy 31. Just as the poem serves as a witness, so too does the Teaching.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:27"><b>Well I know how defiant and stiffnecked you are…you have been defiant.</b> Moses now joins his wrathful voice to God’s, seemingly on the point of despair.

In v. 28, Moses gathers together the elders of the tribes and the officials; but v. 30 stresses that all of Israel must hear the words of the poem. While the writing down of texts is central to this parashah, it begins and ends with Moses speaking. Only after his death will the written word speak on his behalf.<br></br><i>—Adriane Leveen</i><br></br> </div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="right1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="chap" id="ano52-1"><div class="tab-en"> P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYEILECH DESCRIBES</small> Moses’ final preparations before taking leave of Israel. On the verge of his death, Moses appoints Joshua as military commander. He also sets the date on which the Torah should be read publicly; and, in an attempt to protect the people from God’s wrath, he teaches the poem <i>Haazinu</i> (the content of Deuteronomy 32, in the next parashah). Knowing that he cannot enter the Promised Land and that he is about to die does not make Moses less committed to the nation. On the contrary, he carries out these preparations with great care and attention to detail, demonstrating his love and devotion to Israel.
</div><div class="tab-enin">One way that the parashah communicates this message is through the repetition of the word “all” <i>(kol).</i> Deuteronomy 31 begins with the statement that Moses addresses “all Israel” (31:1), and that “in the sight of all Israel” (31:7) he appoints Joshua as commander. The expression “all Israel” (<i>kol Yisrael)</i> is used frequently in Deuteronomy, reflecting the continued insistence that no individual should be left out. When Moses charges the priests and “all the elders of Israel” to impart God’s Teaching (31:9), he repeats the command that this must be done when “all Israel” appears before God (31:11). Moses specifies that “men, women, children, and the strangers” must be gathered to learn “every word” of the Teaching <i>(kol divrei hatorah)</i> (31:12).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses demonstrates his concern and conscientiousness in other ways, too. In particular, he makes sure that women are included. Just as 29:10 makes it clear that women are part of the covenant ceremony, 31:12 states explicitly that women must study and faithfully observe the terms of the covenant. Similarly, Moses writes down the words of this Teaching “to the very end” (31:24), and he also recites the words of the poem “to the very end” (31:30).
</div><div class="tab-enin">The word <i>kol</i> also appears in an earlier passage, one that shows Moses at a rather different point in his life. During the course of the wilderness wanderings, Moses uses a striking maternal metaphor when, exasperated, he tries to distance himself from the people: “Did I produce [or: conceive] all this people <i>(kol haam</i>), did I engender [or: give birth to] them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom as a caretaker carries an infant,’ to the land that You have promised on oath to their fathers?” (Numbers 11:12). Now, at the end of the journey, Moses contemplates death, not birth. Like a loving parent, he conscientiously prepares to bid his “children” farewell as they enter the Promised Land without him.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano52-2"><div class="tab-en"> <i><b>He said to them: I am now one hundred and twenty years old, I can no longer be active</b></i> (31:2). Some commentators could not imagine that Moses was deficient in any way. Ibn Ezra suggested that “I can no longer be active” meant that Moses could no longer wage war. A sage in BT <i>Sotah</i> 13b asserted that in his old age the “sources of wisdom” were stopped up for Moses to prevent his being troubled by the transfer of leadership to Joshua.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Gather the people—men, women, children, and the strangers in your communities</b></i> (31:12). While the Rabbis apparently took for granted that the entire community of Israel was required to hear the divine “Teaching,” medieval interpreters (not usually known for their egalitarianism) wondered why the women were included. Rashi emphasized the distinction between the men and women: whereas the men were there to learn, the women were capable only of listening. <i>Tanna D’Vei Eliyahu,</i> a book of midrashim collected in the 10th century <small>C. E.</small>, uses this verse to prove that it is the man’s responsibility to ensure that every member of his household follows the law faithfully (p. 112). The medieval commentator Nachmanides disagreed, emphasizing in his comments on this verse that the women who were present also learned to fear God.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>When Moses had put down in writing the words of this Teaching to the very end</b></i> (31:24). What does this “Teaching” constitute? Most of the Rabbis understood it to refer to the entire Torah, although they debated whether Moses actually wrote the last eight verses of Deuteronomy that recount his death (see BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 14b–15a). This understanding of Mosaic authorship is present in the Dead Sea Scrolls, where quotations from the Torah are often introduced by “Moses said,” or “as written in the Book of Moses.” However, <i>Tanna D’Vei Eliyahu</i> specifically designates God as the author, maintaining that the Torah was composed before the creation of the world (p. 160) (see Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 1.1). According to this midrash, the divinely revealed words are only called the “Torah of Moses” on account of God’s great mercy toward Israel’s greatest prophet. Several early interpretations of the Bible, such as the pseudepigraphical book of Jubilees, note that the purpose of the writing down of the Law was to remind future generations of the terms of the covenant and of Israel’s obligations to fulfill it. The <i>Testament of Moses</i> 10:11, another pseudepigraphical book, emphasizes that it was now Joshua’s responsibility to keep the words and the book.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Take this book of Teaching and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant…. Then Moses recited the words of the following poem to the very end</b></i> (31:26, 30). Rabbinic and medieval commentators wondered about the relationship between the “Teaching” <i>(torah;</i> 31:9, 11–12, 24, 26) and the “poem” <i>(shirah,</i> often translated by others as “Song”; 31:19, 21–22, 30). According to Midrash <i>Sifrei D’varim,</i> this <i>shirah</i> (Deuteronomy 32), in which Moses calls upon heaven and earth as witnesses, is known as the “Song of Moses.” Since 31:26 designates the Torah as witness against Israel, some of the Rabbis smoothed out the relationship between the “Teaching” and the “Song” by equating the two (see BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 21b and BT <i>Chulin</i> 133a).

</div><div class="tab-enin">Although some commentaries interpret the poem as testimony by Moses <i>against</i> Israel, following the literal reading of 31:26, other rabbinic texts demonstrate that Moses frequently defended Israel to God. Thus, BT <i>B’rachot</i> 32a recalls that following the episode of the Golden Calf, God said, “Let Me alone and I will destroy them” (9:14); but Moses immediately “stood up, prayed vigorously, and begged for mercy” on Israel’s behalf. According to Midrash <i>D’varim Rabbah</i> 3.11, “Moses left no corner in heaven upon which he did not prostrate himself in prayer” on Israel’s behalf (also Midrash <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 42.9). BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 111a–b teaches that Moses continued to advocate for Israel, even after his death.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Then Moses recited the words of the following poem</b></i> (31:30). The Rabbis speak of ten sublime “poems” (or “songs”; Heb. <i>shirah)</i> in the Hebrew Bible that mark central events in the history of the people of Israel; although they differ on the exact listing of the ten, they all include this poem (Midrash <i>M’chilta, B’shalach, Shirta</i> 1). Several of the other songs mentioned are specifically associated with women, including the Song of Miriam, in which she sang and led the women in dance (Exodus 15:20–21), and the Song of Deborah (Judges 5). Both celebrate Israel’s victories over its enemies. According to the <i>M’chilta, B’shalach, Shirta</i> 1, the tenth song will be recited in the messianic era: “Sing a new song to יהוה; / sing God’s praise, all the earth” (Isaiah 42:10).

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano52-3"><div class="tab-en"> I<small>T WAS THE MOMENT</small> for which Moses had prepared nearly all his life. Reared in Egyptian luxury, mothered by a princess, Moses might have lived out his 120 years in careless splendor, unconcerned with the fate of hordes of Israelite slaves who labored outside his palace. Yet, from the moment that Moses—still a young man—slays the Egyptian taskmaster, he chooses to cast his lot with the slaves. For their sake—and their God’s—Moses spends forty years traversing the wilderness, leading a complaining and defiant people, interceding with an inscrutable and demanding Sovereign, and somehow transforming the despised and oppressed into witnesses of miracles and keepers of revelation. The work is almost finished. God and Moses have brought the people to the edge of the Promised Land, a place Moses will not reach. He will gaze upon it from the heights of Mount Nebo, but he will die before he enters it.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Why will Moses forgo the glorious completion of the task into which he has poured his very life? In <i>parashat Vayeilech,</i> Moses himself explains: “I am now one hundred and twenty years old, I can no longer be active” (31:2). Translated more literally, Moses says, “I can no longer go out and come in.” Either way, the message seems clear: Moses is tired out; he is no longer feeling strong or vigorous. So he will remain on this side of the Jordan River, take a peek at the Promised Land, and then die a peaceful and contented death. It may seem strange that he is willing to miss this crowning achievement; but this appears to be his choice.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Except, of course, that he has not made such a choice. As the verse continues, Moses adds what might seem to be a secondary explanation, an after-thought—yet it contains some crucial information: “Moreover, יהוה has said to me, ‘You shall not go across yonder Jordan’” (31:2).
</div><div class="tab-enin">After all, isn’t this the real reason that Moses will not enter the Promised Land? The Torah itself is quite clear that what Moses had done at a certain point prompted God to forbid him from crossing the Jordan. We read the unequivocal divine decree first in Numbers 20:12. After devoting his life to serving God’s chosen nation, Moses shall not set foot in God’s chosen land.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses’ fate is painful, even tragic. Standing before the people he has so steadfastly led, he prepares not to shepherd them triumphantly into the Promised Land, but to install a new leader who will bring them to their destiny. It is, for Moses, a moment of enormous loss. He may speak as if he has a choice—as if he could lead the Israelites into the Land if only he were a little younger, a little stronger—but truly there is no choice at all. He may act as if he has freely decided to stay behind, but it is clear that the choice was made for him.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Today, we like to make our own choices. We live in a time when almost every institution, every career, every level of leadership beckons us. We swell with pride and optimism as we see women serving in the highest echelons of government, in our universities and in our armed forces, as respected doctors, artists, scientists, teachers, philanthropists. We prepare ourselves and our daughters for lives in which every possibility is open to us. We can choose the life we want to live—except when we cannot.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Except when a 14-year-old girl falls prey to our society’s unspoken message to young women—“You are not pretty enough. You are not popular enough. You are not thin enough”—and spends her adolescence battling hateful voices in her head. She may tell you that she chose to watch her weight and eat very little. But in many ways, that choice has been made for her.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Except when a wife endures an abusive relationship, convinced that she is worthless and unable to make her own way in the world. When her husband begins to threaten their children, she finally gathers her courage and flees. Without money or marketable skills, she earns only substandard wages. She may tell you that she chose to go it alone, to work for low pay because she needs a job, to do without health care for herself so that she could provide for her family. But in many ways, that choice has been made for her.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Except when a woman devotes countless eighty-hour workweeks to her career and so is only a year or two away from a prestigious promotion when she and her spouse have a baby. When she returns to the office, her appeals for flexible hours, the chance occasionally to work from home, even a private place to express breast milk, are refused. She may tell you that she chose to quit her job and not work in an unsupportive environment, chose the rewards of at-home motherhood over the rewards of professional life. But in many ways, that choice has been made for her.
</div><div class="tab-enin">We find women all around us submitting to pressures and expectations that undercut our right to choose the life we want to live. And yet, the pressures and the expectations that we encounter are not God’s will. Whereas Moses’ ability to choose his destiny ended when God made known the heavenly decree, our choices should not—must not—be bound by earthly decrees that dishonor and punish women, that teach young girls they are not good enough, that refuse to assist a persecuted victim in need, that force a mother to decide between her career and her child. Acknowledging the injustice of the choices women often face is surely the first step toward changing the pattern.
