<div class="chap"><b>בראשית ✦ <i>B’reishit</i></b></div><div class="chap1a"><small>GENESIS</small><div class="tab-en">G<small>ENESIS IS A BOOK OF</small> beginnings, birthings, and blessings. It depicts the origin of humankind as a family, and then it follows the development of one particular family. Genesis serves as the “prequel” to the Exodus story that the Bible repeatedly presents as Israel’s founding event. Tracing the people’s origin back to its beginning, Genesis identifies who the Israelites are and how they came to be in Egypt.</div><div class="tab-en1">After a brief yet crucial description of how God creates an orderly world and its inhabitants (1:1–2:3), the book persistently focuses on families. The first part (Genesis 1–11) provides an overview of the human family as a whole, establishing the unity of all people while also accounting for diversity and dispersion. These early chapters depict human development as a series of transgressions and transformations in which both God and humankind discover and develop their relationship. The rest of the book focuses on Israel’s ancestors: Abraham, Sarah and Hagar (Genesis 12–23); Rebekah and Isaac (Genesis 24–26); Jacob, Leah, and Rachel (Genesis 27–35, with a genealogy of Esau in 36); Joseph, Judah, and their brothers (Genesis 37–50)—each generation with its trials, tribulations, and triumphs. In these accounts, women play an active and integral role.</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-en1">Although many traditional interpreters (both Jewish and non-Jewish) believe that these stories depict the actual lives of our ancestors, most contemporary scholars consider the historical information in Genesis to be more oblique. Such scholars consider Genesis to be a tapestry woven from several sources, sometimes labeled as J, E, and P (see Women and Interpretation of the Torah); they suppose that the book is the work of later generations who retroject into the past the tensions and circumstances of their own time. Thus, a careful reading of Genesis offers insights into how ancient Israel constructed its identity at different points in its history. For example, Jacob’s sons apparently represent clans that at some point banded together and then sought to account for this later unity by constructing a shared genealogy. Likewise, stories such as the tale about Lot’s daughters (Genesis 19) try to account for both affinity and tension with surrounding cultures.</div><div class="tab-en1">Considering Genesis in its broader ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean context—where stories of origin feature violent creation and heroic and semi-divine figures—highlights Genesis’ distinctive worldview. Genesis begins with a peaceful creation and then concentrates on an ordinary, aged couple (Sarah and Abraham, who become extraordinary as their story unfolds), with whom God enters into a covenant, and on their somewhat fumbling offspring. Far from promoting fame and fortune through great feats of might, Genesis illustrates how persons walk with God (17:1) dialogue with God (Genesis 18), and also wrestle with God (Genesis 32) in the pursuit of blessings.</div><div class="tab-en1">The theme of sibling rivalry runs through Genesis from beginning to end (in contrast with Greek mythology, in which intergenerational conflict often occupies center stage). Beginning with the first murder (Abel by Cain; Genesis 4), competition between siblings plagues every generation. Eventually, the persistent, murderous impulse is channeled into repentance and reconciliation when Joseph unites tearfully with his brothers (see 45:1–15 and 50:18–22). Sibling rivalry and competition also characterize the story of the book’s two prominent sisters, Leah and Rachel (Genesis 29–30 and 35:16–20). Remarkably, however, their competition results in producing children, jointly building the “House of Israel” (as the community affirms in Ruth 4:11).</div><div class="tab-en1">Beginning with daring Eve, resourceful women are central to the book of Genesis. Women are key, not merely because they give birth, but because they shape their family’s destiny; there would be no “Israel” without the matriarchs. Their stories belie any claim that Genesis privileges males at the expense of females. Rather, the book privileges the ones who secure the continuity of the family and perpetuate God’s blessings. In addition to Eve (Genesis 1–4), Sarah (Genesis 12–23), Hagar (Genesis 16 and 21), Rebekah (Genesis 24–28), Leah, Rachel, and their handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah (Genesis 29–31), Genesis devotes attention to the dilemma of Lot’s daughters (Genesis 19), the tragic fate of Dinah (Genesis 34), the triumph of Tamar (Genesis 38), and the seductive Potiphar’s wife (Genesis 39). Together, these women represent the biblical understanding of humans as God’s partners in maintaining God’s good world.</div><div class="pre-right"><i><b>—Tamara Cohn Eskenazi</b></i></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"> </div></div><div class="chap" id="ano"><b>בראשית ✦<i>B’reishit</i></b></div><div class="chap1"><small>GENESIS 1:1–6:8</small><i>Creation and Transformation</i><div class="tab-en">W<small>HO ARE WE</small>? The question is answered in the first portion of Genesis as follows: We are God’s prized creation, inhabiting a good world that God has made. We are a constellation of four relationships: with the earth from whence we came and whither we return (Genesis 2), with each other as women and men equally blessed and jointly commissioned to care for the world (Genesis 1), with the animal world toward which we have responsibility (Genesis 1 and 2), and with God in whose image we are made (Genesis 1) and whose breath animates us (Genesis 2). Human disobedience complicates these relationships but does not destroy them.</div><div class="tab-en1">Genesis 1 emphasizes the power of language and the reality of goodness. Humankind is embedded in a larger world over which God reigns supreme, but within which human beings can and do play a unique, decisive role.</div><div class="tab-en1">A wide-angle lens that encompasses the whole world in Genesis 1 is augmented in Genesis 2–3 with a zoom lens that discloses an “up close and personal” relationship with God. This split-screen view characterizes the Torah as a whole and introduces a biblical practice of offering more than one perspective on important events.</div><div class="tab-en1">The subsequent narratives, through Genesis 11, continue to respond to universal human questions about origins. They account for human suffering and inequality while affirming the sovereignty of a God who deeply cares for the world and its creatures.</div><div class="tab-en1">Genesis 1–11 depicts God as still discovering the qualities of the material at hand (humankind) and (re)assessing its potential. Despite repeated disappointments, God remains faithful and hopeful, adjusting expectations and offering humankind new tools and guidance.</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-en1">The parashah concludes at a nadir, with God’s disappointment in humankind when violence corrupts goodness (6:6). However, the text also makes clear the possibility of renewal despite decline (a theme throughout the Bible). Goodness and connectedness persist.</div><div class="tab-en1">No biblical story has had more influence on women’s lives and identity—and none has been more often reinterpreted through later cultural biases—than the creation of woman in Genesis 2 and the expulsion from the Garden in Genesis 3. The version of creation of humankind in 1:26–28, which portrays equality between the sexes and their shared reflection of God’s image, is typically overlooked in favor the more ambiguous one in Genesis 2, which is typically read as one in which man precedes woman in time. Consequently, the first woman has been cast by later interpreters as an afterthought: second and therefore secondary in value, not essential to God’s plan. She has also been held solely or at least primarily responsible for human suffering.</div><div class="tab-en1">However, a close reading of Genesis 1–3 indicates that such (mis)readings overlook the context and nuances of the depiction of woman. Suffice it to say here that the first woman is depicted as a discerning, responsible person who despite transgression (Genesis 3) maintains a creative partnership with both God and the first man. She is rightly recognized by her man as a source of life (3:20).</div><div class="tab-en1">Other named women make cameo appearances: Ada, Zillah, and Naamah (4:19–23). The parashah concludes with a mysterious account about the illegitimate seizing of women, a prelude to the flood story that will follow (see at 6:1–8).</div><div class="right1">—<i>Tamara Cohn Eskenazi</i></div><div class="lefta" id="out">

Genesis does not offer a scientific account of creation but an interpretation and a systerm of values that encodes from the start three essential ideas: the power of language, especially God’s word; the goodness of God’s world; and the orderly nature of the world. Creating the world begins with a series of separations—from chaos to differentiated bodies—that, with one exception (day 2), are pronounced as “good.” In the first three days God creates a context for life. In the last three God creates heavenly and earthly bodies to inhabit the space. The movement of each day, from evening to morning, replicates a journey from darkness to light.</div><b>When God was about to create.</b> The more familiar expression “In the beginning” has been replaced by the more accurate translation. As Rashi noted, the opening verses do not claim creation out of nothing.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:2"><b>chaotic waters’.</b> The feminine noun <i>t’hom</i>, often translated as “the deep,” echoes the name of the Mesopotamian goddess Tiamat. According to the Babylonian creation myth, Tiamat was brutally killed by her rebellious offspring in the process of creating the world. See also at 7:11, “great deep.”</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:3"><b>God said.</b> God’s use of language contrasts with some other ancient Near East creation stories that emphasize battles among the gods. By privileging language as a source of creative power, the Torah identifies tools for renewal in times of military defeat.<br></br><b><i>“Let there be light!”</i></b> As the first of God’s creative acts, light becomes not only a physical phenomenon but also a symbol of clarity and illumination that extend beyond the physical.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:4"><b>God saw how good.</b> This phrase repeats in similar form six times in this passage, expressing the basic goodness of God’s creation.<br></br><b><i>God divided</i></b> God brings order out of chaos by separating the swirling mass into coherent bodies (land, contained water, sky), which will provide a habitat and sustenance for life.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:10"><b>collected</b> The noun <i>mikveh</i> is rendered here as an adjective to suit English idiom. It is the usual word for a reservoir or other bodies of water (Exodus 7:19, Leviticus 11:36), including eventually a ritual bath. On the <i>mikveh</i> as ritual bath, see <i>Tazria</i>, Contemporary Reflection.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="1:26–30" ref="1:26"><b></b> Day six, the most complex and detailed, first describes the emergence of land creatures from the earth (vv. 24–25). Thus far, each species has been endowed with the capacity of reproduction and renewal (vv. 12, 21, 25). The narration now dwells the most on the creation of humankind (vv. 26–27), indicating its importance in the created realm.<br></br><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:26"><b>“Let us make.”</b> God is speaking to the divine entourage; compare Genesis 6:4 and Job 1:6, which envision <i>b’nei Elohim</i> (literally “sons of God”) as divine beings subordinate to God.<br></br><b><i>“human beings.</i></b>” Heb. <i>adam</i>, a singular noun, stands here for a collective, like the English words “fish” or “fowl.” It refers to humankind as a whole, including both females and males (compare 5:1–2). Older translations render it as “man,” often meant in its gender-neutral sense—a usage that is sometimes misunderstood and thereby misleading. In fact, the noun <i>adam</i> is almost always a generic term, employed when gender is not germane. Apart from the thirty references to the particular <i>adam</i> of the Eden story (who gives rise to the name “Adam”) and one to the progenitor of a lineage (Joshua 14:15), none of the Bible’s 530 other occurrences of <i>adam</i> refers to a particular individual (David Stein, “What Does It Mean to Be a ‘Man’?” 2006–7, § VI:B; <i>“adam,” Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew</i>, 2007; Alison Grant, <i>“’adam</i> and <i>’ish:</i> Man in the OT,” 1977, pp. 5, 11).<br></br>Here, the preceding verses have narrated the generic creation of other earthly creatures, a context that now evokes the correspondingly generic sense of <i>adam.</i> Thus, the Hebrew text unambiguously presents female and male as co-created and equal.<br></br><b><i>“our image, after our likeness.”</i></b> These tantalizing attributes are uniquely bestowed upon human-kind as a whole. They introduce a new way for the divine to be manifested in the world through every human being. The notion that all humans are in the divine image is in sharp contrast to ancient Near East traditions where only kings represent the divine. This radical idea from the Hebrew Bible proved to be a fundamental notion in Western history.<br></br><b><i>“hold sway.”</i></b> See at 1:28 and 9:1–7.</div></div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:27"><b>human beings.</b> This translation resorts to the plural to avoid using misleading masculine pronouns later in the verse. Literally the Hebrew has: “And God created the <i>adam.</i> In the image of God he created <u>him/it</u>; male and female he created <u>them</u>” (shifting the object pronoun from singular to plural). By referring to <i>adam,</i> the text is not describing an individual but a new class of beings that comprises female and male from the start, both of them in God’s image. This idea is repeated more clearly in 5:1-2. The shift from singular to plural does not convey that man was created before woman. (That the singular pronoun is masculine can be explained as necessary for grammatical gender agreement in the Hebrew language.) Rather, it seems to say that our humanity, as <i>adam,</i> precedes our division into sexual categories. Our humanity comes first; our sexual identity next.<br></br><b><i>male and female.</i></b> This passage explicitly proclaims the co-creation of female and male, both in God’s image. It establishes the goodness and gender balance as the foundation for all that follows. The terms male (<i>zachar</i>) and female (<i>n’kevah</i>) designate biological categories, thus relevant to fertility, a major theme in this passage. The word <i>zachar</i> evokes the Hebrew word for “remembering,” and <i>n’kevah</i> evokes the word for being pierced.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="1:28"><b>God then blessed them.</b> Female and male receive the same blessings.<br></br><b><i>“Be fruitful and multiply.”</i></b> The harsh conditions and the fragility of life in the ancient world make fertility a most valued gift and necessity. The plain sense of the text is that this “first commandment” is issued to both female and male.<br></br><b><i>“hold sway.”</i></b> This promise surely brought comfort to early readers who lived at the mercy of the natural world, who were vulnerable to its unpredictability, and who had reason to fear becoming prey to wild beasts. It is not a mandate to exploit nature.

Only the seventh day, not yet designated as Shabbat, is holy. Time, not space, is thus consecrated, which (as A. J. Heschel notes) becomes a hallmark of Judaism.

Genesis is unique in ancient Near Eastern literature in giving special attention to the formation of woman. In Greece, however, Hesiod (8th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) claimed that the first woman, Pandora, was created to ensnare men to their death. In contrast, Genesis 2 envisions the creation of woman and man for mutual benefit: “It is not good for the <i>adam</i> to be alone” (2:18). In contrast to Genesis 1, here the gender identity of the first <i>adam</i> is ambiguous (see at “the man,” v. 7); therefore, the status of woman in Genesis 2 remains open to different interpretations.</div><div class="tab-en1">Many Jews and Christians over the centuries have interpreted the early portions of Genesis to mean that woman was secondary and thus subordinate, created merely for man’s benefit. Three factors argue against such interpretations. (<i>1</i>) The term <i>adam</i> is generic, not specifically “a man,” complicating the notion of the gender identity of the first person. (<i>2</i>) Even if one interprets this particular <i>adam</i> as male, last does not mean least. (Indeed, in Genesis 1 human beings are created last, a sequence that some interpreters consider a sign of superiority.) (<i>3</i>) God creates human partnership, not hierarchy, in Genesis 2. (For a different interpretation, see Contemporary Reflection.)</div><div class="head2">THE FIRST HUMAN (2:4–7)<br></br></div><b></b>. This verse bridges the text’s first two units. (The present translation places it with the second one.) Its first clause concludes the first story of Creation, and its second begins the story that follows.<br></br>.יהוה The first time in the Bible that God’s name—<i>YHVH,</i> liturgically read as <i>Adonai</i>—appears. Later traditions consider this name to represent specific qualities of God, such as compassion (in contrast to the term “God,” which emphasizes justice). Most translations use “the L<small>ORD</small>” (so the New JPS) or “the Eternal” (<i>The Torah: A Modern Commentary,</i> revised edition). Some translations have used “Jehovah” or “Yahweh” in an attempt to capture the sound of the name. Like <i>The Contemporary Torah</i> (2006), we have chosen to retain the original Hebrew name. In the post-biblical period, Jews came to believe that God’s name is too sacred to be pronounced. This has led to substituting the reverential euphemism <i>Adonai</i> (a grander form of the word for “my Lord”) for God’s actual name. The name itself shows no marks of gender. Some scholars have understood it as a form of the verb “to be,” although this explanation is now disputed and far from certain. An abbreviated form of the name appears as “Yah” in names (Jeremiah) or words such as “Hallelujah.” (See also at Exodus 3:15.)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:5"><b>there was not a soul.</b> Literally, “no <i>adam</i>” —no human being.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:7"><b>man…from the soil</b>. Or, “soul…from the soil,” to express the word play between <i>adamah</i> (soil; earth) and <i>adam</i> (a human being, an “earthling”). In contrast to Genesis 1, <i>adam</i> is created before the animals and set in a fertile place to care for it.<br></br><i><b>God…breathed</b></i>. The human being is infused with divine breath (literally “in-spired”).<br></br><i><b>breath.</b></i> Heb. <i>n’shamah,</i> often translated as “soul,” is the life force that comes from God.<br></br><i><b>man.</b></i> Heb. <i>adam,</i> which can be rendered as “human beings,” as it is translated in Genesis 1:26–27 and 5:1–2. In those verses and elsewhere in the Bible, <i>adam</i> designates a generic human being or a collective noun but sometimes refers also to an individual person, as here.<br></br>However, in the present case <i>adam</i> is ambiguous with respect to gender. On the one hand, <i>adam</i> may continue to convey an inclusive sense of the term (as in 1:26–27); this would imply that this second story of creation views the first human as either neuter or androgynous until the division into man and woman, at which point specific words for man <i>(ish)</i> and woman (<i>ishah</i>) appear for the first time (2:23–24). Such a gender-neutral or non-gendered progenitor of humankind was familiar to the ancient world. It appears, for example, in Plato’s <i>Symposium,</i> which describes humans as not gendered initially but divided later into three types of pairs: man and woman; man and man; woman and woman. The myth thus accounts for different sexual affinities as persons seek their specific “other half.”<br></br>On the other hand, <i>ha-adam</i> (“the adam”) in 2:7–3:30 designates a particular individual whom the early readers may have understood as male. David Stein suggests that <i>ha-adam</i> in this story functions as an etiology “not of human biology but rather of lineage” (<i>The Contemporary Torah,</i> 2006, p. 394). This presumption works well with the narrative flow—in which even after the creation of woman, the term <i>ha-adam</i> continues to be used to refer to the man. On those grounds, he renders <i>ha-adam</i> as “the Human” while using male pronouns.<br></br>These gender ambiguities may express the writer’s attempt to express complex ideas about the position of male and female in God’s plan, and the tension perceived in cultural reality. Although the precise intention remains unclear, this story certainly presents—as Phyllis Bird notes—“a portrait of humankind in which the two sexes are essential to the action and are bound together in mutual dependence” (“Bone of My Bones and Flesh of My Flesh,” <i>Theology Today</i> 50/4 [1994], p. 524).<br></br>In this verse, the immediate emphasis falls on the person’s earthiness: the word <i>adam</i> is juxtaposed with <i>adamah,</i> which means “earth.”</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:8"><div class="head2" id="ge_2.8-17">HUMANKIND’S FIRST HOME:<br/>THE GARDEN OF EDEN (2:8–17)<br></br></div><b>a garden in Eden.</b> The place name <i>eden</i> (pleasure) evokes a moist, luxurious garden.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="2:9"><b>good for fruit.</b> The Hebrew words <i>maachal</i> (fruit, literally “food”) and <i>achal</i> (eat) together appear more than twenty times in the Eden narrative, evidence of an overriding concern among the text’s earliest audience with procuring food.<br></br><i><b>Tree of All Knowledge.</b></i> The familiar, literal translations “knowledge of good and evil” or “knowledge of good and bad” preserve an ambiguity that seems intentional. The phrase “good and bad” could stand for “everything,” but it also could imply intellectual comprehension (everything from <i>A</i> to <i>Z,</i> or from good to bad), moral judgment, or —perhaps best—experience, meaning a direct encounter with good and bad. It is the latter that seems to have befallen humankind as a result of eating.

And <i>negdo</i> (opposite him/it) suggests a spatial and metaphorical otherness, someone whom one confronts. Psalm 16:8 envisions God in this position, illustrating the positive sense of the word.<br></br>Some scholars who assume that God seeks a remedy for human loneliness conclude that God creates woman to comfort and ease man’s life. But God’s solution implies that what is not good about aloneness concerns the human need for a counterpart.

If one understands <i>ha-adam</i> (“the <i>adam”)</i> beforehand to refer to a non-gendered person, then this remark describes the division into two human categories: woman and man. Here <i>ish</i> designates “a (male) member of the human species,” and <i>ishah</i> “a (female) member of the human species.” Both are fully and equally human.

Yet she and her mate are equally held responsible.</div><div class="tab-en1">The story reflects two possible theologies about God and knowledge. God may be perceived as a protective parent, ambivalent about exposing vulnerable humans to the full range of experience that knowledge brings; but God could be understood also as a protector of divine prerogatives against the human desire to have more than is permitted. Either way, the story also cautions about the danger of “premature knowledge”—a message especially pertinent to our own day, where knowledge (as information) is easily separable from maturity.</div><div class="tab-en1">Although most later interpreters have made this story of transgression the turning point in human events, in Genesis this is but the first of several encounters between God and human beings in which both sides learn about the perils and possibilities of the human condition. There is no mention of an original sin, perpetually present in humankind. The word “sin” does not appear here at all in this episode. Nowhere does the writer imply that humanity is doomed to make bad choices. There is no “Fall of Man.” Nor does God curse humankind. Rather, the story makes clear that transgression, namely disobedience, carries consequences.</div><div class="head2" id="ge_3.1-6">TEMPTATION AND TRANSGRESSION (3:1–6)<br></br></div><b>serpent.</b> Its role here is perhaps a polemic against other traditions, where serpents—representing healing wisdom—become objects of idolatry. Compare the bronze serpent in Numbers 21:6–9 and its destruction in II Kings 18:4. (Note also the ancient roots of our modern medical symbol, the caduceus, with its intertwined serpents.)<br></br><i><b>cunning.</b></i> The word (in the singular here) is the same as the one for “naked” in 2:25, one of several puns that run through the narrative.<br></br><i><b>“Did God really say…?”</b></i> The Hebrew is ambiguous, but the intent is clear: a question to draw attention to the one prohibited tree.<br></br><i><b>“You may not.”</b></i> The “you” is plural, including the man who (according to 3:6) is with her. Why the man remains silent is left to the reader’s imagination.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:3"><b>“God said.”</b> The woman is the first human to speak of God and to engage in dialogue. She will invoke God in almost every one of her statements (also 4:1, 25). In contrast, the man does not mention God in his speeches.<br></br><i><b>“do not [even] touch it.”</b></i> God does not prohibit touching the tree in 2:17. If the woman adds this element herself, she anticipates the Rabbis whose rulings later create a “fence around the Torah,” meaning additional prohibitions to prevent an accidental violation of Torah laws.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:4"><b>“You…will not die!”</b> The woman and man live long after their transgression.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:5"><b>“God knows…you will be like gods.”</b> This new information will prove true—God confirms it in v. 22. Those who criticize the woman argue that the wish to be like God—a usurpation of divine power—prompts her to transgress God’s command. The next verse, however, debunks this claim by offering a rare biblical description of a person’s motive. Hers includes a desire for wisdom.<br></br><i><b>“all things.”</b></i> Literally, “good and bad.” See at 2:9.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:6"><b>the woman saw.</b> Genesis lists three reasons why the woman reaches for the fruit: it is good to eat (healthful); visually attractive; and a source for wisdom. (No motive is ascribed to the man. He will simply take and eat.) The desire for knowledge, rather than immortality, distinguishes this story from other ancient traditions such as Gilgamesh.<br></br><i><b>its fruit.</b></i> The type is not identified; the fig is the only kind of tree specified in the story (v. 7). Some later traditions championed the apple, which has since come to the fore in the popular imagination.<br></br><i><b>she gave…to her man who was with her.</b></i> Only now does the reader learn that the man was with the woman all along (note also “<i>her</i> man”). The silence concerning the man’s motive is all the more problematic if he (alone) was directly warned by God in 2:17. Most earlier translations unfortunately omit “with her,” letting readers assume that the man was ignorant of the exchange and thereby innocent. Genesis, however, portrays both woman and man as culpable. The woman takes the first step toward what modern interpreters call consciousness-raising. If the tree entails “knowing all things,” then woman is bringer of civilization, not death. As for giving the fruit to the man, Carol Meyers observes that this reflects Israelite agrarian families, where women doled out the food. Note the emphasis on eating in this etiological tale. (See <i>Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Woman in Context,</i> 1988.)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:7"><div class="head2" id="ge_3.7-21">THE TRANSFORMATION (3:7–21)<br></br>The four relationships that constitute the human being—with the land, the animals, each other, and God—suffer a severe blow but prove enduring nevertheless.<br></br></div><b>they were naked.</b> As the serpent promised, their eyes open, leading to a new awareness.<br></br><i><b>made themselves skirts.</b></i> Possibly modesty and shame resulted from eating the fruit. At any rate, knowledge discloses to them their vulnerability, exposing them to the precariousness of life and to consequent fear.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:9"><b>“Where are you?”</b> God’s first question is more than a mere request for location; it is an opportunity to accept responsibility.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:10"><b>“I was afraid because I was naked”</b> The fear could imply a moral awareness stemming from transgression, an awareness of vulnerability, or both.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:12"><b>“The woman whom You gave me.”</b> An opportunity for repentance (“I did so, and I am sorry”) is used instead for double blame: the man blames the woman and also God. As a result of his refusal to accept responsibility, his disobedience alienates him from both God and the woman.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:13"><b>“The serpent tricked me.”</b> The woman likewise shifts the blame, but not to God.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:14"><b>“you…are under a curse.</b>” While all three culprits pay a price for their transgression (and the humans’ unwillingness to own up to it), only the serpent is explicitly cursed. The narrator presents God as one who considers the serpent the most culpable. This emphasis is overlooked by later interpreters who focus on the woman as cause.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:15"><b>“between you and the woman.”</b> Enmity destroys a harmony between humankind and animals.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:16"><b></b> God’s words to the woman have been misinterpreted in ways that disadvantaged women dramatically. The pronouncements to the woman (v. 16) and to the man (v. 17) are largely parallel, which implies parallel consequences. But for several centuries the key term has been typically rendered one way regarding the woman and another regarding the man, in a manner that intensifies the punishment for the woman, prompting the claim that her culpability must have been greater than the man’s.<br></br><i><b>“your toil and your pregnancies.</b></i>” Older translations and some recent ones translate this pair of nouns differently. The New JPS version has “your pangs in childbirth,” and Chaim Stern’s translation of Genesis in <i>The Torah: A Modem Commentary,</i> revised edition, has “your pains of pregnancy.” (This verse and the next are the only places in this book where we have changed Stern’s translation.) The Hebrew noun <i>itzavon</i> (from <i>etzev</i>), is here translated as “toil.” In ancient Israel women regularly worked long hours—in food preparation and storage, in the manufacture of clothing, in farming alongside of men, and more. For the Torah’s original audience, this story would have brought such labors readily to mind. The word can also be rendered as either “sorrow,” “hardship,” or “anguish.” All these meanings appear elsewhere in Genesis (for example, “hard labor,” 5:29). Indeed, <i>itzavon</i> does not mean “pain” elsewhere in the Bible. For more details, see Another View.<br></br>The writer in vv. 16–17 is accounting for the hardships of human existence and especially the creative aspects of life: procreation and production of food. Earlier ease is now mingled with hardship: “good” comes with “bad.”<br></br><i><b>“anguish.</b></i>” The word here is <i>etzev,</i> a term related to <i>itzavon</i> in the previous line; it predominantly means “sorrow.” Those whose experience is conveyed by <i>etzev</i> include: God, when humankind does not meet expectations (Genesis 6:6); Jonathan, when his father humiliates him (I Samuel 20:34); and David, when his son dies (II Samuel 19:3). Most instances of this verb in narrative pertain to sorrow in connection with family members.<br></br>Our translation as “anguish” rather than “toil” (as for <i>itzavon</i>) aims at differentiating the nuances between two related Hebrew terms. (The King James Version of 1611, which has been authoritative for centuries in English-speaking countries, translates both <i>etzev</i> and <i>itzavon</i> as “sorrow.” Other translations, including Chaim Stern’s, substituted forms of “pain” for “sorrow,” presumably in recognition that childbirth is often painful.)<br></br>Genesis 3:16 neither imposes physical pain upon the woman nor condones it. The passage describes the hardship that often accompanies birthing and raising children. Unlike the pronouncements to the serpent, which speak of perpetual enmity, nothing suggests that this <i>etzev</i> is a continual condition. Thus along with her joy in being a parent (4:1), the first woman will herself experience—and express—sorrow and the need for comfort after her first-born kills his brother (4:25). On the etiological function of this pronouncement, see Another View.<br></br><i><b>“desire.”</b></i> Heb. <i>t’shukah</i>. The word appears only three times in the entire Bible—twice in Genesis (see also 4:7) and once in Song of Songs (7:11). Here it acknowledges woman’s desire or passion. It may seek to account for why women are able and willing to overcome (or overlook) the hardship of childbirth. It may also suggest that the woman’s desire is what places the woman under the man’s control; compare God’s warning in 4:7. (Song of Songs, which celebrates equality and mutuality between man and woman, reverses the relationship, describing in 7:11 the man’s desire for the woman.)<br></br><i><b>“he shall rule over you,”</b></i> God’s words should not be read (as they have in both Jewish and Christian traditions) as an unqualified mandate for males’ general control over females. In this verse, “ruling” is confined to situations in which desire is at work. The writer may be communicating the power of desire to make one person subservient to another.<br></br>Another view is that in the ancient context the writer acknowledges a husband’s responsibility for his wife’s sexuality.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:17"><b>“Because you hearkened to your wife.”</b> Literally, “…to your wife’s voice.” In 21:12 God will command Abraham to hearken to his wife’s voice; thus this notice is not meant as a blanket objection to obeying one’s wife. Oddly, there is no indication earlier that the woman said anything to the man.<br></br><i><b>“I commanded you,”</b></i> God accuses only the man of disobedience (the “you” is singular).<br></br><i><b>“the soil is now cursed”</b></i> The land has done nothing to deserve punishment. But for Israelite farmers the etiology explained why their land was not fertile. Again, neither the woman nor the man is cursed.<br></br><i><b>“toil”</b></i> Heb. <i>itzavon;</i> see at 3:16. Initially, working the land was presented as creative and satisfying labor, and now it also becomes a hardship.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:19"><b>to dust.</b> Presumably, eating from the Tree of Life would have enabled them to live forever.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:20"><b>The man called his wife’s name.</b> In the Bible names often disclose the hopes and reality of the naming person, not the named. The man, significantly, becomes aware of the woman as a source of life precisely when the prospect of death is made comprehensible. Faced with inevitable disintegration, he recognizes–and celebrates–her life-bearing ability.<br></br><i><b>Eve.</b></i> Heb. <i>Chavah</i>, a play on <i>chai</i> (life). The narrator explains the word-play and accounts for the woman’s role as child-bearer. The designation confirms the text’s positive depiction of the woman’s role in Eden and beyond.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="3:21"><b>God…clothed them.</b> Far from displaying anger, God appears as a concerned protector, re placing the couple’s flimsy covering with sturdy material.

But here, in fact, the Torah gives new, important lessons. The first couple turns back—not back to the garden, but to one another and to God. The man who earlier blamed the woman now enters into an intimate relationship with her, and the woman names their first child in honor of her partnership with God. With these halting steps, they begin to repair the damage of earlier acts.</div><b>The man now was intimate with his wife.</b> Literally, “the <i>adam</i> knew his woman/wife.” Here <i>adam</i> can only mean the man. In Hebrew “to know” includes sexual intercourse; fundamentally it expresses intimate knowledge of the other.<br></br><i><b>saying.</b></i> The woman is the one who names the children and records the history and meaning of the family’s life, both here and again after the death of Abel (see at 4:25).<br></br><b>“Both I and יהוה.”</b> Eve is the very first human being to use God’s personal name, just as she was the first human to mention God (3:3).<br></br><i><b>“made a man.”</b></i> Commentators consider this “man” a reference to the son—whose name, Cain (<i>kayin</i>), is a pun on “made” (<i>kaniti</i>). If so, then Eve acknowledges here that giving birth involves God and celebrates the mystery of female creativity. However, Eve could also be referring to her husband as one who became hers with God’s help. The verb <i>k-n-h</i> elsewhere often means “acquired” and typically refers to a man acquiring a wife (see Ruth 4:10). In a surprising reversal here, the woman is acquiring “a man.”</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="4:2"><b>his brother Abel.</b> The name Abel (<i>hevel</i>) means “mist” or “vapor,” hinting at transience.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="4:4–5" ref="4:4"><div class="head2" id="ge_4.3-24">THE FIRST SIN: CAIN AND ABEL (4:3–24)<br></br>In the Torah, the word “sin” only enters with sibling rivalry and the murder that follows (not with Eve and Adam). Murderous conflict among brothers runs throughout Genesis as a theme that finally finds its resolution with the reconciliation between Joseph and his brothers (Genesis 50). Sisterly conflicts result in births (see 30:1–24). | In an ancient Sumerian story about the goddess Inanna, a farmer and shepherd compete for her affection; and she chooses to marry the shepherd. Competition between two modes of life may also account for this story in Genesis. The emphasis on “brother,” which appears seven times in this narrative, may be a literary ploy, a way to say that all humans are “brothers” and thus all murder is “fratricide.”<br></br></div><b></b> No reason is given for God’s acceptance of Abel’s offering and not Cain’s.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="4:6"><b>“Would you not do well to lift it?”</b> The Hebrew is difficult.

Once again, the first man is intimate with (“knew”) his wife and she conceives. Nothing in these reports of life outside the garden suggests that the woman was subservient to the man. To the contrary: she is the one who speaks; she is the one who names; and she has the power to interpret and preserve the family’s history.<br></br></div><b>she…gave him the name.</b> As in 4:1, the woman names the child and interprets the significance of the experience.<br></br><i><b>“given.</b></i>” Heb. <i>shat,</i> a word play on the name <i>shet</i> (Seth).<br></br><i><b>“God has given me.</b></i>” Once again, the woman acknowledges God.

It reminds one of Greek mythology, which it indirectly opposes. Whereas Zeus’ marriage with women produces heroes such as the venerated Hercules, the Bible portrays such unions as a calamity to be eradicated. The penalty affects human beings alone. Far from gaining immortality, the marriage of heaven and earth reduces human life span. Tikva Frymer-Kensky notes that in the Mesopotamian tradition, the reverse takes place: “Goddesses choose powerful men, particularly kings, as lovers” (<i>Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 177).</div><b>daughters were born to them.</b> Only daughters are mentioned, not sons (who surely were born as well).

Traditional translations understand it to mandate painful pregnancies and the domination of women by men. However, that four-line poetic passage can be understood in a different way.</div><div class="tab-en1">In Hebrew the first line of the poetry has four words: <i>harbah arbeh itz’vonech v’heronech.</i> The first two words constitute a double verbal form that asserts that the following two words—subjects of the verb— will be more intense, more plentiful, or more numerous than would be expected. The present translation “I shall greatly increase” is a satisfactory rendering of the double verb.</div><div class="tab-en1">The usual translation of the two nouns <i>itz’vonech v’heronech</i>—“your pains in [or: of] pregnancy”—is problematic. First, as stated, both nouns are objects of the verb “increase.” That is, the Hebrew speaks about two distinct conditions that are subject to increase, joined by the Hebrew conjunction “and.” Second, the word “pain” is inaccurate. For one thing, it suggests that pregnancy itself is painful, which is not the case in most normal gestations (in contrast to giving birth, which is often painful). Furthermore, the uninflected noun <i>itzavon</i> otherwise often refers to the “hard work” of physical labor, which it almost certainly does in the next verse in reference to the agricultural work of men: “through <i>toil</i> shall you eat of it.”</div><div class="tab-en1">For these reasons, our translation for the first line of 3:16 is “I shall greatly increase your <i>toil</i> and your <i>pregnancies</i>.” Not only does this rendering better reflect the Hebrew wording, but also it reflects the agrarian life situation of the Israelites. The highlands of the Land of Israel were not very fertile or well watered. Therefore, the hard work of both women and men was required for households to survive. Moreover, children were needed for the family labor force. With as many as one in two children dying before the age of five, a woman needed to have up to eight pregnancies to provide the optimum family size of four offspring.</div><div class="tab-en1">The other three lines of the verse expand on the theme of procreation. The second line (“in anguish you shall bear children”) conveys the difficulty of childbirth itself, that is, the mental and also the physical anguish of giving birth. The third line (“to your man is your desire”) refers to the passion—emotional as much as sexual—that a woman feels for her husband. Such passion allows her to succumb to the dominance mentioned in the last line: “And he shall rule over you.” In keeping with the focus of this verse on childbearing, that line probably speaks about a husband’s ultimate responsibility for his wife’s sexuality and not for her entire person. Because of the risks of death in childbirth, many Israelite women would have been reluctant to have numerous pregnancies. Yet, passion toward their spouses serves to prompt women to respond to male sexual urges and thus accept the possibility of another pregnancy. Indeed, some medieval commentaries understood it this way.</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-en1">The translation as “rule”—though accurate in a limited way—remains inadequate because it implies general male dominance over women—and has usually been interpreted that way for millennia. Unfortunately, no single word in English precisely conveys the meaning of the Hebrew term in this context.</div><div class="tab-en1">Like many biblical passages, Genesis 3:16 is an etiology, helping people to accept the difficult realities of life by viewing them as having been mandated by God. For Israelite women this meant hard work and many children as well as enduring the risks of procreation. Although their sexuality may have belonged to their husbands, women in other ways were autonomous individuals who controlled important aspects of household life.</div><div class="right"><i>—Carol Meyers</i></div><div class="image1"><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot2.jpg"/></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"> </div></div><div class="chap" id="ano1"><i><b>Post-biblical Interpretations</b></i><div class="tab-en" id="ge_1.26"> <i><b>God now said, “Let us make human beings…”</b></i> (1:26). The rabbinic sages read the two quite different accounts of human beginnings in this parashah as one continuous text. They took for granted that the male and female creations of Genesis 1 were the Adam and Eve of Genesis 2–3. However, the Rabbis were skeptical that men and women were created simultaneously in the divine image as stated in 1:26; they generally insisted that the first woman was formed later, from the first human being, as in Genesis 2:4–25. In Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 8.1, Rabbi Jeremiah ben Leazar suggested the compromise position that initially God created one entity with both male and female sexual characteristics. Only afterward, as described in Genesis 2:22, did God separate the female “side” to form the first woman from an essentially male entity. This midrash makes the powerful point that man and woman were initially created as a united being to which they revert when they become <i>one flesh</i> (Genesis 2:24) in marriage.</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>“In our image, after our likeness”</b></i> (1:26). Parallel comments in <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 8. 9 and 22. 2 maintain the precedence of the man in human creation, while stressing the crucial role of marriage and procreation in human life: “In the past, Adam was created from the ground, and Eve from Adam; but henceforth [with the birth of offspring] it shall be <i>in our image, after our likeness.</i> Neither man without woman, nor woman without man, nor both of them without the <i>Shechinah.”</i> This invocation of the <i>Shechinah</i>—the indwelling nurturing aspect of the Divine, designated by a feminine noun—indicates that for the Rabbis, the female also shares in the divine image when she is joined to the male in a fruitful marriage.</div><div class="tab-en1"><b><i>God then blessed them</i></b> (1:28). Continuing the strong connection between Creation and marriage, <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 8.13 records the tradition that God “took up a cup of blessing and blessed them.” Then it adds: “Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon said: [The angels] Michael and Gabriel were Adam’s ‘best men.’ Rabbi Simlai said: We find that the Holy One blesses bridegrooms, adorns brides, visits the sick, buries the dead, and recites the blessing for mourners. God blesses bridegrooms, as it is written: <i>God then blessed them;</i> and adorns brides, as it is written: <i>Now God יהוה built up the rib taken from the man into a woman</i> (Genesis 2:22).”</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-en"><b><i>Then God</i> יהוה <i>considered “It is not good that the man be alone—I will make him a helpmate”</i></b> (2:18). <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 17.2 teaches: “A man without a wife lives without good, without help, without joy, without blessing, and without atonement.…Some even say he falls short of the divine image, since immediately following <i>For human beings were made in the image of God</i> (Genesis 9:6) it is written, <i>As for you, be fruitful and multiply</i> (9:7).” For the Rabbis, humankind is like God in its ability to create human beings, yet reproduction requires both females and males. According to BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 63a, women also help men in pragmatic ways; there the prophet Elijah meets Rabbi Yosi and asks him rhetorically: “If a man brings in wheat, does he chew on the wheat? If flax, does he put on the flax? [No, he must wait until his wife sees to the processing of the wheat into bread, and of the flax into clothing!] Does she not, then, bring light to his eyes and put him on his feet?”</div><div class="tab-en1"><b><i>and the man said, “This time</i>— / <i>bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh!”</i></b> (2:23). Prompted by <i>This time,</i> several rabbinic passages mention a previous time—a “first Eve,” who fled from Adam and was replaced with a second female creation (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 17.7, 18.4, 22. 7). This legend was later combined with ancient folk traditions about the night spirit Lilith. In the <i>Alphabet of Ben Sira</i> (possibly 8th century <small>C.E.</small>), Lilith’s rebelliousness is attributed to her equal creation with Adam. Refusing to be subservient in sexual intercourse or in any other way, she became a demon rather than endure Adam’s domination. Jewish folklore attributed nocturnal emissions to Lilith, who was said to set upon sleeping men. She was also blamed for maternal deaths in childbirth and for infant mortality. One popular remedy was amulets bearing the names of angels. Lilith is further demonized in Jewish mystical traditions where she and her satanic husband Samael become the evil counterparts of Adam and Eve. (On Lilith, see further Judith R. Baskin, <i>Midrashic Women,</i> 2002, pp. 58–60.)</div><div class="tab-en1" id="ge_3.16"><b><i>And to the woman, [God] said</i></b> (3:16). Some Rabbis blame Eve for the expulsion from the Garden of Eden and its consequences. While Adam was punished for his participation in divine disobedience, none of the pronouncements against him in Genesis 3:17–19 apply only to males. But Eve, and through her all women, received additional gender-specific punishments—and rabbinic literature discusses them frequently. The inventory found in <i>Avot D’Rabbi Nathan</i> B 42 includes: menstruation, “when she is driven from her house and banned from her husband”; childbirth; nursing her children; and being subject to her husband’s authority and his jealousy. Moreover, she ages quickly and ceases to give birth, while “men never cease being able to beget children.” Also, a woman stays indoors; and when she goes out, her head must be covered like a mourner: “That is why women precede the funeral bier, saying, ‘We have brought death upon all the inhabitants of the world.’” Such harsh views permeate rabbinic commentary on Eve’s creation and her role in the Garden of Eden, and they had a long and pernicious afterlife in shaping Jewish and Christian views of women.</div><div class="right"><i>—Judith R. Baskin</i></div><div class="image1"><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot2.jpg"/></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"> </div></div><div class="chap" id="ano2"><i><b>Contemporary Reflection</b></i><div class="tab-en"> T<small>HE ANCIENT</small> B<small>ABYLONIAN MYTH</small> (or foundational story) that strongly resembles Genesis 1 has one great dissimilarity from it: in that myth, creation begins with a murder. The goddess Tiamat—cognate to our word <i>t’hom</i> (watery chaos, 1:2)—is slain by the hero-god Marduk; and the universe is carved out of her body. Violence there is inextricable from the process of creation. In Genesis 1, however, creation entails no destruction. Even the primal watery abyss is not completely obliterated but lingers at the bottom of the sea to reappear in many a psalm or story. The drawing of distinctions and boundaries that marks both accounts is in Genesis 1 peaceful and harmonious.</div><div class="tab-en1">God distinguishes elements of the original watery chaos by drawing boundaries between them and naming them: light and darkness, day and night. Created elements are not simple oppositions. They are both distinct and akin. Juxtaposed verses emphasize the parallels between elements. There are waters above and waters below. Between them stretch a solid expanse of earth and a solid expanse of firmament. The earth brings forth grasses and trees. The sky is strewn with lights. The sea and the air bring forth swarms of living things, schools of fish, flocks of birds, clouds of insects. The earth births its many creatures, joyously productive, mirroring the water and the air.</div><div class="tab-en1">The creation of humankind continues these dual themes of distinction and similarity. Not one but two words underline the likeness between <i>adam</i> (the earthling) and its Maker. Humankind bears the <i>tzelem</i> (image) and <i>d’mut</i> (resemblance) of the divine Creator, although in contrast to God’s oneness, they are several. They are also distinguished from one another: <i>zachar</i> (which means “male” but is also a word related to “remember”), the bearer of the male member, and <i>n’kevah</i> (which means “female” but is also a word related to “piercing”), the pierced one. In Genesis 3 the two will become a hierarchy, but in Genesis 1, they are presented as equals. Both bear the divine image and semblance, both are adjured to “be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and tame it, and hold sway…over all the earth” (1:28).</div><div class="tab-en1"><i>Adam</i> is the only creature whose sexuality the text notes—that is, describes as male and female. This suggests a sexuality unlike that of the animals. Moreover in both 1:27 and a summary in 5:1–3, the mention of <i>adam</i>’s maleness and femaleness is immediately followed by the proclamation of its divine image, as if our diverse sexualities and our kinship with God were linked. Rather than our sexualities being <i>dissimilar</i> to God or excluded from the divine image, they seem to <i>point toward</i> some element in the divine nature, some divine attribute—creativity or delight, perhaps, or the longing for an Other—for which our embodied sexuality is the metaphor.</div><div class="tab-en1">Genesis 2 and 3 tell a darker tale. Here we learn why <i>adam</i> is called <i>adam.</i> Multiple puns are evoked by the name: kinship with <i>adamah</i> (earth or soil) out of which <i>adam</i> is fashioned, association with the color red (<i>adom)</i> like the ruddy sunburnt skin of the worker and the red earth he was created to till, and resonance with blood (<i>dam),</i> the red life-fluid. Unlike in Genesis 1, however, in 2:7–3:20 the term <i>adam</i> refers to the man. The woman is never called <i>adam</i> but only <i>ishah</i> (woman), “for this one is taken from man” (2:23). Together they are <i>ha-adam v’ishto,</i> “the human and his woman,” for the first man represents both the male particular and the generically human.</div><div class="tab-en1">As the verb “built” (2:22) attests, the creation of woman differs from other creations. The dual <i>adam</i> of Genesis 1 is created (<i>bara)</i> by divine word, and the <i>adam</i> of Genesis 2 is fashioned or molded (<i>yatzar)</i> by a divine potter. The woman is constructed <i>(banah)</i> out of part of an existing creation. An afterthought, created when <i>adam</i> finds the animals unsatisfactory for mating, she is meant to be <i>ezer k’negdo,</i> literally “a helper over against him,” that is, opposite him or corresponding to him. The ambiguity in the expression foreshadows an ambivalent relationship. Is she against him or for him? A challenger or an “other” who mirrors him and merges with him? Awakening, <i>adam</i> claims her as part of himself: “bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh” (2:23). He does not appear to recognize her otherness, nor does he address her. Her only recorded conversations are first with the serpent and then with God. Finally, at the end of the chapter, <i>adam</i> names her as he previously named the animals. It does not occur to him to ask her what she calls herself.</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-en1">Genesis 1 is an account of the Creation, whereas Genesis 2–3 is an account of the creation of patriarchy—a remarkably truthful account. The world brought about by Genesis 2–3 is one in which desire is no longer joyful but oppressive. Even before the disobedience, relations between man and woman and world are commodified and function-based. <i>Adam</i> is created to till the soil. Woman is created to help <i>Adam.</i> However lush, the garden is a workplace. Created things are good, not intrinsically as in Genesis 1, but because they are resources. The Garden is described as prime real estate, rich in water and in trees, and adjacent to lands rich in gold and gemstones. Everything is viewed extractively. The forbidden fruit is presented as the epitome of desire in terms not of intrinsic value but of what it is good <i>for:</i> “good to eat,” “alluring to the eyes,” “desirable for insight” (3:6).</div><div class="tab-en1">Woman’s desire for man ensures her subjugation and her anguish (3:16). Man’s desire is not even mentioned. He is exhausted by the effort to pull from the ground what can be consumed before descending into the ground and being consumed by it. Adam and Eve are alienated from each other, from the earth, from their labors, from the rest of creation.</div><div class="tab-en1">The world of patriarchy cries out for mending. A mending world would commit itself to equality and power-sharing, to working cooperatively in order to fill needs and solve problems. At one again with the rest of Creation, perhaps we would even learn not to resent our mortality so bitterly. Reunited also with the rest of creation, men and women could learn again to be “loving friends”—as the traditional rabbinic wedding blessing portrays them.</div><div class="right">—<i>Rachel Adler</i></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"> </div></div>
