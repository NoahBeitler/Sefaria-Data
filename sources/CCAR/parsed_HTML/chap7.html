<div class="chap2" id="ch-7"><i>The Journey Within
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>AYEITZEI</small> (“he went out”) is the Torah’s greatest love story. In it the lovers—Rachel and Jacob—figure as doubles. Their lives are in many ways parallel. Each of them works as a shepherd, flees from home, steals a father’s legacy, contends with sibling and God alike, tricks others and is in turn tricked, and bargains for the blessing of having children. The stories of Rachel and Jacob illustrate the distinct but intersecting male and female journey cycles that characterize Genesis 12–35. In the male journey cycle a hero departs from home, gains intimacy with God by wandering promised and unpromised lands, has visions while exposed in the outdoors, and struggles to fulfill God’s blessing by engendering children.
</div><div class="tab-en1">For their part, the matriarchal heroines also wander across external terrain. However, their journey toward intimacy with God takes place in the internal terrain of the body. Three of the four matriarchs experience a state of barrenness; two of them (Sarah and Rachel) reverse it by articulating their discontent or taking direct action in order to signal their intentions to create life. The often extreme measures they take in order to give birth alert God to their drive. This leads to a divine encounter that results in conception.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Genesis acknowledges that conception ensues from sexual relations. But the subtext of the female journey cycle indicates that its success requires intimacy not only between a man and a woman but also between a woman and God. Following the birth of a child, the mother encodes the memory of her specific path from barrenness to fertility in the name that she bestows as a legacy to her child. This paradigm is apparent as Rachel and her sister, Leah, compete for the love of both Jacob and God while simultaneously birthing the people of Israel. Their achievement is celebrated in the book of Ruth when the people praise “Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel” (Ruth 4:11).

</div></div><div class="note"><div class="head2a" ref="28:10"><i>Departure of the Hero Jacob</i> (28:10–22)<div class="tab-en">Jacob’s flight and return serve as the frame of this parashah, which recounts how the people of Israel were built up through the intersecting struggles and wills of Rachel, Leah, and Jacob. When Jacob departs from home with the intangible gifts of the blessing and the birthright, he exhibits his youthful adaptability by using a stone for a pillow and sleeping alone in the mountains blanketed in darkness. These mountains—which form the western boundary of the Jordan River Valley—serve as a threshold to the realm of the Divine that Jacob recognizes as he sleeps. As he awakes and speaks, the confidence and self-certainty of the young Jacob become apparent. This vision where Jacob sees the angels of God will be balanced and extended by his nocturnal wrestling with a divine being on the east side of the Jordan prior to his eventual return home (32:4–33). The transformation that he undergoes is evident in the change of tone in which he speaks to God on either side of the Jordan. The youthful Jacob stipulates a list of terms (28:20–21) while the older Jacob pleads to God to save his family despite his unworthiness (32:10–13). A parallel transformation is evident in Rachel and Leah, who initially employ language as the means of their competition, but ultimately speak with one voice when deciding to embark on a journey away from home.
</div></div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="28:10–11" ref="28:10"><b>28:10.</b> The journey begins. Previously, Jacob’s mother, Rebekah, had secured his father’s blessing for him through a stratagem; then she had ensured her son’s safe passage from home. In so doing, Rebekah had voiced two intentions for Jacob’s departure: safety and a wife (27:4–28:4). Thus he now journeys with the dual intent of finding safety in his uncle Laban’s house and finding a suitable wife. On his way from Beersheba to his uncle’s in Haran, Jacob stops at an unidentified place.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="28:12–15" ref="28:12"><b>28:12.</b> Scholars have noted that the ladder in Jacob’s dream is most likely a ziggurat, a tower known from the temples of Mesopotamia. This “ladder” serves as a bridge between heaven and earth upon which angels ascend and descend—thus indicating the dialogic nature of communication between the two realms. Thus Jacob has begun a double journey: a dream journey toward increasing proximity to God parallels his physical wanderings across the horizontal plane of space. Jacob encounters his angels while traveling. The stations between home and exile have a corollary in the rungs between heaven and earth.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="28:16–22" ref="28:16"><b>28:16.</b> Jacob’s deal with God follows his dream.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="28:19"><b>He named that place Beth El.</b> The vision results in a new perception of his environment as “the house of God” and “the gate of heaven.” Accordingly, Jacob names it <i>Beit El</i> (House of God). Beth El—as it is known in English—later became the national sanctuary of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, although one that some prophets maligned (Amos 3:14; 4:4; 5:5–6; Hosea 10:15). In ancient Israel the account of Jacob’s vision likely justified and sanctified the Beth El temple.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="28:20–21" ref="28:20"><b>28:20.</b> Jacob drives a hard bargain with God. Jacob wants real-life indicators that God will watch over him wherever he goes, and will return him to his native soil. He pledges that if he meets with success on his journey, then the God of his father’s household will be his God, his pillow will become the cornerstone of a temple, and he will sacrifice a tenth of his bounty.<br></br> <br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="head2a" ref="29:1"><i>Temporary Home for Jacob, Leah, and Rachel</i> (29:1–30)<div class="tab-en">It is one of the Torah’s great paradoxes that the divine imperative to engender descendants and produce a great nation reaches fruition first in the land of Aram (Syria) and later in Egypt. In this episode, Jacob finds refuge in his uncle’s home and meets his counterpart, Rachel, thereby satisfying the wishes of his mother. In a foreign land he also engenders a family and becomes wealthy, thereby bringing God’s promises into being.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="ge_vv.1-8" ref="29:1">JACOB AT THE WELL (29:1–8)<div class="tab-en1">The well is the Torah’s famed meeting place, a romantic topos. Here Abraham’s servant finds Isaac’s bride, Rachel and Jacob meet, and Moses first encounters his future wife, Zipporah. (On wells as symbols of fertility, see at 16:7 and 24:11.) It is also the place where Jacob goes to seek information about his relatives.
</div></div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:6"><b><i>29:6.</i></b> In the midst of Jacob’s inquiry, Rachel appears guiding the flock.</div><div class="head2" id="ge_vv.9-21" ref="29:9">MEETING RACHEL (29:9–21)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:9"><b>she was a shepherd.</b> The first description of Rachel does not emphasize her beauty—as is sometimes the case when a female character is introduced (Rebekah, Genesis 24:16; Abigail, I Samuel 25:3; Bathsheba, II Samuel 11:2). Rather, it declares her occupation. Rachel’s very name means “ewe.”</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:10"><b>rolled the stone off the well’s mouth.</b> In this occasion of biblical humor, Jacob is so overwhelmed when Rachel appears that—in superhero fashion—he single-handedly rolls the stone cover off the mouth of the well. The reader is particularly impressed with this, having just been informed that the act required the efforts of all Haran’s shepherds.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:11"><b><i>29:11.</i></b> One cannot help but wonder about Rachel’s response to the stranger who kisses her, weeps, and then declares that he is her cousin.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:12"><b>he was Rebekah’s son.</b> Jacob identifies himself only as Rebekah’s son, not Isaac’s. (On the place of women in the kinship ties of Israelite social structure, see at 10:1.)<br></br><b><i>she ran.</i></b> The text, tending toward silence about emotions, speaks only of her acts of running and announcing the arrival, as did Rebekah when Abraham’s servant revealed his identity at the same well (24:28). Rebekah, however, ran to her mother’s house.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:14"><b>“Truly, you are my bone and my flesh!”</b> Laban’s effusive statement of recognition and solidarity will soon become ironic as uncle and nephew prove equal in chicanery.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:16"><b>Now Laban had two daughters.</b> In the pasture Rachel had been identified as a shepherd, but at home she is marked as the younger of two sisters. When Leah is introduced, Rachel’s beauty becomes a cause for further distinction in the face of Leah’s “weak eyes” (v. 17). Jacob has fallen in love with Rachel and soon attests to his willingness to sustain the love for seven years (v. 18). In the ensuing scenes, the focus falls on Rachel and Leah; Laban’s sons are not mentioned until they voice their resentment at Jacob’s success (31:1).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:17"><b><i>29:17.</i></b> Leah and Rachel are described as different in appearance. Earlier, the text had contrasted Jacob and Esau also on the basis of their respective occupations (25:27, where <i>yoshev ohalim</i> seems to mean “raising livestock”; compare 4:20).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:18"><b>“seven years for your younger daughter.”</b> In the social world of the Bible, a bridegroom or his family needed to compensate his bride’s household. Apparently, part of this payment would normally accrue to the bride herself. (See <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Another View, and at 31:15.)<br></br>Two biblical motifs are evident here: of love directed to a younger child (Rachel), and of seven (years) as a number of wholeness.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:19"><b><i>29:19.</i></b> Laban speaks of Rachel as a gift that he will bestow on his nephew and says nothing about the work extracted from Jacob. Laban’s manipulation of Jacob begins with his appeal to familial bonds, asserting that it is within his power to “give” Rachel to whomever he desires.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:20"><b>a few days.</b> Heb. <i>ke-yamim achadim.</i> Jacob’s perception of his seven years of labor as “a few days” recalls the <i>yamim achadim</i> (“a while,” literally “a few days”) that his mother, Rebekah, had recommended that he spend with Laban (27:44).</div><div class="head2" id="ge_vv.22-30" ref="29:22">JACOB’S MARRIAGE TO LEAH AND RACHEL (29:22–30)<br></br>In Jacob’s mind the marital relationship with Rachel will be enacted by his initiation of the sexual act. Where Jacob imagines an act of intimacy, Laban plans a public feast.<br></br>Laban substitutes his older daughter for the younger. The provocative question that arises from this bed-trick is the same as that raised by Rebekah and Jacob’s earlier deception of Isaac: does human subterfuge disrupt the divine plan—or advance it? In this case Laban’s trick enables the building of the house of Israel through the combined efforts of the two sisters and their two maids. It is precisely the interfamilial competition that renders the household productive.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="29:26–29" ref="29:26"><b>29:26.</b> The unfolding scenario—in which Jacob weds two sisters—is an instance where a biblical law (the prohibition against marrying a woman’s sister during her lifetime, Leviticus 18:18) is contradicted by an episode in biblical narrative.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:30"><b>[Jacob] made love with Rachel, too.</b> Literally, “he also came into Rachel,” which is a biblical way of indicating a sexual intercourse. At long last Jacob is united with his beloved Rachel.<br></br><b><i>he loved Rachel…so much more than Leah.</i></b> The preference of one wife over the other reintroduces the theme of favoritism that begins with Cain and Abel (Genesis 4) and continues as sibling rivalry throughout Genesis. Such preference, while promoting strife within the family, leads in the sisters’ case to productivity and the realization of the divine blessing in the human realm.<br></br> <br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="head" ref="29:31"><i>From Barrenness to Fertility</i></div><div class="head1" ref="29:31">LEAH AND RACHEL BIRTH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL (29:31–30:24)<div class="tab-en">The narrative focuses on how each matriarch negotiates the terrain between barrenness and fertility, which offers cherished insight into the individual characters of these biblical women. Where the male heroes seek to conquer, claim, and sanctify land, the female heroes strive to inscribe their memory on the bodies of their heirs; the acts of birthing and naming function as the counterpart to those of inaugurating and settling territory. The matriarchs go to extreme lengths in order to initiate and improvise their own Covenant. The female journey spans the poles from barrenness to fertility and affords the matriarch the opportunity to wrestle with other persons, God, and social position. The steps of this journey are: barrenness, statement of protest, direct action, encounter with God, conception, birth, and naming.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="ge_29.31-30.13" ref="29:31">COMPETITION BETWEEN SISTERS (29:31–30:13)<div class="tab-en1">Whereas Jacob has split from his brother, Rachel must live alongside her sister as co-wife. Previously, the narrator has emphasized that Jacob “loves” Rachel by mentioning it three times (29:18, 20, 30). In this section, according to the narrator, God infers that Leah is in contrast “disfavored” (in Hebrew, literally “hated”; v. 31) and intervenes by making Leah fertile.
</div></div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:32"><b>bore.</b> As the translation reflects, the directness of the Hebrew root <i>y-l-d</i> points to the action of birthing. It thus emphasizes the agency and volition of the matriarchs. In contrast, the usual English idiom “to give birth” focuses more on the <i>outcome</i> of birthing, namely, the child.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="29:32"><b><i>29:32–35</i></b>. Rachel’s infertility becomes doubly bitter in the shadow of Leah’s celebrations of the births of her first four sons. Through the names, Leah exults that “יהוה saw my plight” (Reuben, a pun on “See, a son!”) and “יהוה <i>heard</i> that I am despised and has given me this one too” (Simeon, a pun on “hearing”); she speculates that “this time my husband will be <i>attached</i> to me” (Levi, a pun on “Accompany”), and resolves that “this time I <i>give thanks</i> to יהוה” (Judah, a pun on “thanks”). While marking her triumphs and articulating her desire for marital love in the names of her sons, Leah bequeaths them sibling rivalry, an inheritance that drives the story of Joseph and his brothers.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:1"><b>“me…I.”</b> <i>Heb. li…anochi</i>. Rachel emphasizes her personal need for children through first person pronouns (see also at v. 3); she is concerned with her vitality and her own lineage. Let Jacob have his sons with Leah, but he must—at the same time—preserve Rachel’s individual legacy.<br></br><b><i>“otherwise I am a dead woman!”</i></b> Rachel equates her inability to give birth with death, implying that her story will never be told if not condensed in the name of a child; ironically, she will eventually die giving birth to her second child (35:18). In effect she protests not only the state of barrenness, but also the limits that her society sets on female autonomy. In this case, Rachel speaks to the threat of her negation should she not reproduce. Perceiving the limits of her own authority, she turns to a person with immediate authority over her—her husband, Jacob.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:2"><b><i>30:2.</i></b> Jacob deflects responsibility and in fury directs Rachel’s protest toward God. However, had Rachel not spoken out, her journey would have had no beginning and no fulfillment.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:3"><b>But she said, “Here is my maid Bilhah.”</b> That is, her slave; see at 16:1. The space between barrenness and fertility is a gap in the relationship between Rachel and God that she must bridge through symbolic acts. By employing her slave, Bilhah, as a surrogate, Rachel performs a kind of imitative magic in which she plays the Deity— causing a woman to conceive in the hopes that the Creator will likewise fertilize her. Like Sarah (16:13) and Leah (below, v. 9), Rachel relies on surrogacy also to bypass the obstacles to conception more directly. She achieves her goal by claiming the body of another woman as an extension of her own. In biblical narrative, birth is a moment of female collaboration when the boundaries between distinct bodies collapse, an occasion in which multiple female bodies operate in tandem. All females on the narrative stage at the moment of birth function as a collective body absorbed in the process and implication of birthing. This is evident in the surrogacy scenes, as well as in the birth scenes of Rachel and of Tamar—in which midwives take part in the naming of the child (35:17–18; 38:29; see also I Samuel 4:19–22). It is also clear when the midwives defy Pharaoh in order to save the lives of Hebrew babies (Exodus 1). Birth as a collective female action even transcends ethnic difference, as in the book of Ruth. There, Ruth the Moabite pledges to bind her body and her fate to her Israelite mother-in-law, Naomi—who has declared herself “too old to be married” (Ruth 1:12). Following the birth of Ruth’s son, a chorus of women blesses Naomi with the pronouncement that “a son is born to Naomi” (4:17). (On surrogacy see also at Genesis 16:2.) | Viewed from a more individualistic perspective, it is deeply problematic that the matriarchs potentially force their servants into undesired sexual relations.<br></br><b><i>“my…I too.”</i></b> Heb. <i>gam anochi.</i> Rachel emphasizes her personal volition when spelling out the surrogacy procedure to Jacob, adding an extra firstperson singular pronoun.<br></br><b><i>“I…may have a son.”</i></b> Heb. <i>ibaneh,</i> the same term that Sarah had used (16:2); on its meaning, see there.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="30:6–8" ref="30:6"><b>30:6.</b> As Bilhah twice gives birth, Rachel has the opportunity to thrust her own jabs at her sister through the names of sons: Dan (a pun on “judge”) because “God has <i>judged</i> me and has also listened to my plea”; and Naphtali (a pun on “struggle”) because “a mighty <i>rivalry</i> have I waged with my sister.”</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:8"><b>“I have prevailed”</b> Heb. <i>yacholti.</i> As she engages in sibling rivalry, Rachel also struggles with God in order to win the ability to give birth. Her naming of Naphtali is verbally linked with God’s later renaming of Jacob as Israel: “for you have struggled with God and with human beings, and you have prevailed (<i>vatuchal</i>)” (32:29). Both Rachel and Jacob prevail in contests doubly waged with people and with God.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:9"><b>Leah saw that she was no longer bearing children.</b> Leah is never called barren, but she does experience a period of infertility.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="30:10–13" ref="30:10"><b>30:10.</b> Leah stresses her good fortune as she names the sons of Zilpah. <i>Gad</i> means literally “good fortune” and <i>Asher</i> is a name based on a verb form (“Fortunate is…”) that anticipates that other women will declare Leah fortunate.</div><div class="head2" id="ge_30.14-24" ref="30:14">EXCHANGE BETWEEN SISTERS (30:14–24)<br></br>The turning point in the sisters’ relationship comes with their readiness to enter into an exchange—to give each what the other lacks. Symbolically, Leah is willing to give fertility (via mandrakes) to her barren sister and, in turn, Rachel gives Jacob to Leah, who longs for his love. | Whereas Jacob will first draw a truce with God (32:25–31) and then negotiate an icy peace with his brother (33:1–17), Rachel first strikes a deal with her sister and then wins the ability to create from God.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:14"><b>mandrakes.</b> Or “love fruits,” known as an aphrodisiac as well as an aid to conception.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:15"><b><i>30:15.</i></b> Leah’s acerbic response exposes her pain. Rachel turns her sister’s complaint into terms of negotiation by giving Leah “back” her husband for one night in exchange for the mandrakes. In the meantime, she increases her request for a portion of the mandrakes to a demand for all of them.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:18"><b><i>30:18.</i></b> As she names her fifth biological son, Leah attests that she is rewarded by God: Issachar (a pun on “reward” or “hire”), saying, “God has given me my reward because I gave my maidservant to my husband” (30:18). The name also puns on Leah’s pre-coital statement to Jacob, “I have bought (or: hired) you with my son’s mandrakes” (30:16).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:20"><b><i>30:20.</i></b> In this naming ceremony, Leah utters a pious word of thanks, which hints at the name Zebed. But then she expresses her true wish. The name Zebulun reflects her focus on improving her marriage.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:21"><b><i>30:21.</i></b> The exchange (v. 15) results not only in the birth of Leah’s fifth and sixth sons but also in her first daughter, Dinah. The phrase “she conceived and she bore” associated with the birth of each son is absent here. Also absent is a naming declaration for Dinah, although her name means “judgment that leads to justice.”</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:22"><b><i>30:22.</i></b> The mandrakes (vv. 14–15) do not cure Rachel’s barrenness, but they do alert God to her desperation—and the lengths to which she will go in order to conceive. In other words, the actions that Rachel takes to reverse her situation function as self-initiation into a relationship with God. They also prove her to be an ambitious mother worthy of a heroic son. Rachel has followed a three-part course in protesting her infertility: articulation of discontent, surrogacy, and medicinal aid. God likewise responds with three actions: “God now remembered…listened…and opened her womb.” Her struggle results in a response from God—such that her memory is assured, her voice heeded, and the barrier to conception lifted.<br></br><b><i>God…remembered.</i></b> The same idea appeared (in different Hebrew terms) when God “remembered” Sarah and she became pregnant (21:1). In the biblical accounts of the nation of Israel’s loss or suffering, acts of memory (whether human or divine) are the first step toward redemption. In the stories of barren women, the occasion of divine remembrance signals that their actions have led to acknowledgment—and the reversal of their situation.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:24"><b><i>30:24.</i></b> The giving of a name affords the new mother an opportunity to tell her story of movement from barrenness to fertility, and to perpetuate her experience through the child’s ascribed identity. Although Rachel uses a pious statement that “God has removed (Heb. <i>asaf)</i> my disgrace,” she calls her son Joseph <i>(yosef</i>), meaning “may God add on <i>(yosef)</i> another child for me.” Celebrating her victory, Rachel already begins strategizing for another.<br></br> <br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="head" ref="30:25"><i>Leaving Laban</i></div><div class="head1" ref="30:25">JACOB, LEAH, AND RACHEL JOURNEY TOWARD A HOME IN CANAAN (30:25–31:42)</div><div class="head2" id="ge_30.25-31.3" ref="30:25">COMPETITION BETWEEN MEN (30:25–31:3)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="30:32"><b>“speckled and spotted goat.”</b> These animals are worth less than solid-colored goats.

Thus Rachel, like Jacob before her, deceives the father in order to gain tokens of power and authority. Once again, Rachel is a counterpart to Jacob (Ilana Pardes, <i>Countertraditions in the Bible,</i> 1992, p. 61). She may also have sought the <i>t’rafim</i> to serve as fertility gods, hoping for a second child (see Contemporary Reflection). | The Torah includes a number of trickster stories like this, showing how marginalized men and women outwit the powerful in order to survive or safeguard justice (for example, Genesis 12:10–20; 38:1–30).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="31:24"><b>God then came to Laban the Aramean in a dream.</b> This is the third in a series of dreams where God guides and protects Jacob.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="31:26"><b>“driving my daughters off like prisoners of war.”</b> After Rachel and Leah have voiced their desire to extricate themselves from their father and his manipulations (vv. 14–16), Laban’s claim of concern for his daughters’ well-being strikes the reader as hollow.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="31:28"><b>“sons and daughters.”</b> That is, his grand children and his daughters.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="31:32"><b>“the one with whom you find your gods shall not live.”</b> Through law and story alike, the Torah as well as later Jewish tradition warns against oathtaking.

If one reads the story through modern eyes, where love conquers all, then Rachel seems to be more important than Leah. However, if one reads this parashah with an eye toward its own biblical concerns, then Rachel and Leah look very different.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The love story begins with Jacob seeing Rachel (29:10). The text notes that Rachel is “beautiful of form and of face” (v. 17). To modern readers beauty is positive, but in the Hebrew Bible it is dangerous for women. Abram charges that Sarai’s beauty threatens his life (12:11–12), and Amnon rapes Tamar, supposedly because of her beauty (II Samuel 13). In other places in the Bible, when people make choices because of what they see, those choices prove to be misguided. For example, Lot chooses to live in the Jordan plain because it looks nicer than Canaan (Genesis 13:10–11). Samson marries a Philistine woman because of her appearance (Judges 14:1–3), and the results are disastrous. Clearly the Bible does not recommend judging a book by its cover.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The text notes that “seeing Leah was disfavored, יהוה opened her womb” (Genesis 29:31). This clearly means that the Deity sympathized with Leah. Leah names her first child Reuben because of a play on words that the Deity saw her plight, but she adds what she hopes it will bring her: the love of her husband (v. 32). The second child follows the same pattern; Simeon is so named because God “heard” of her plight (v. 33). The third son, Levi, is named in the hope that her husband will be attached to her (v. 34). All three names reflect not only thankfulness but also a need for more—namely, Jacob’s love. With her fourth son, something finally changes and she names him Judah because, “This time I give thanks to יהוה” (v. 35). Thus Judah, who becomes the forefather of most of the Jewish people, is so named because his mother was simply thankful to the Deity to have him.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano7-2"><div class="tab-en"><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg28.jpg"/><b><i>Now Laban had two daughters</i></b> (29:16). Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 70.15 portrays the sisters Rachel and Leah as equal partners in building the Jewish people: “Both produced chieftains and kings.…Both produced prophets and judges.” Leah was “greater in gifts,” in that her sons were the ancestors of the priests and the Davidic kings.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><b><i>Leah’s eyes were weak</i></b> (29:16). In <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 70.16, Rabbi Yohanan explains that Leah’s eyes had grown weak from weeping. It had been expected that Rebekah’s two sons would marry Laban’s two daughters—and Esau was intended for Leah. Hearing negative reports about Esau’s conduct, Leah had wept, praying that her destiny would change. Rabbi Huna observes that Leah’s prayer had been powerful enough to alter her fate, but in the process her eyes were permanently affected.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><b><i>In the morning</i></b> (29:25). The commentators are amazed that Leah fooled Jacob. After living in Laban’s house for seven years, surely Jacob could tell Rachel and Leah apart! Furthermore, how did Laban prevent Rachel from warning Jacob of the deception? Midrash <i>Eichah Rabbah,</i> proem 24, explains that Rachel was a willing—albeit unhappy—partner to Laban’s plan. In this midrash, Rachel recounts her version of the events of Genesis 29. Aware that her father was plotting to deceive Jacob, she warned her future husband of Laban’s plans. Jacob and Rachel agreed upon a sign to allow Jacob to distinguish between the sisters. But then, Rachel changed her mind, realizing that if Laban’s plan failed, Leah would be shamed. Instead of thwarting her father’s plot, Rachel aided her sister in the deception: “That evening, my sister took my place with Jacob and I taught her the signs I had given him so that he would think she was Rachel. I also hid under the bed upon which they lay, and when Jacob spoke to my sister, I responded while she was silent so that he would not recognize her voice. In this way, I showed kindness to my sister; I did not act on my jealousy and saved her from disgrace.”

</div><div class="tab-en1"><b><i>Laban then gave his maid Bilhah</i></b> (29:29). According to the 11th-century commentator Rashi, the slaves Bilhah and Zilpah were Laban’s daughters by his concubine, thus suitable mothers of four of the tribes of Israel (on 31:50). The childless Rachel’s use of Bilhah parallels Sarah’s earlier use of Hagar in 16:1–3 (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 71.7). Leah’s motives in giving Zilpah to Jacob are less clear; some commentators suggest that Leah acted to ensure that Jacob would father twelve sons. The Midrash <i>Tanna D’Vei Eliyahu Rabbah</i> 25 (Ish-Shalom edn., p. 138) counts Rachel’s and Leah’s willingness to offer their maidservants to Jacob as among the righteous acts of the matriarchs that led to Israel’s redemption from Egypt. Some traditions include Bilhah and Zilpah among the matriarchs (<i>B’midbar Rabbah</i> 12; <i>Shir HaShirim Rabbah</i> 6; <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 1.10).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><b><i>“Let me have children”</i></b> (30:1). Rachel’s demand is understood by rabbinic tradition as a complaint against Jacob. She expects him to pray on her behalf, as his father Isaac did for Rebekah. Jacob was criticized by some rabbis for his harsh reply (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 71.7). Isaac Arama, a 15th-century commentator in Spain, attributed Jacob’s frustration to Rachel’s insistence that a childless woman is worthless. He argues that women have two functions: like men, they can develop their intellectual and spiritual qualities, and they can also bear and raise children. Jacob wants Rachel to recognize that she can have a meaningful life even if she has no children <i>(Akedat Yitzchak</i> on Genesis 3:20).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><b><i>Afterwards she bore a daughter</i></b> (30:21). The power of Leah’s prayers is again emphasized in BT <i>B’rachot</i> 60a. Commenting on “afterwards,” Rav suggests that after she discovered she was pregnant, “Leah reasoned, ‘Jacob is destined to father twelve tribes. I have given birth to six sons, and the handmaidens have borne four. If this child is a son, my sister Rachel won’t be equal even to the handmaidens.’ Immediately, the child [in her womb] was transformed to a female.” In other versions of this miraculous demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, the handmaidens, Bilhah and Zilpah, join Leah in prayers on Rachel’s behalf (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 72.6).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><b><i>Reuben went and found mandrakes</i></b> (30:14). In <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 72.5, the sages explain that through these mandrakes two additional tribes came into being, Issachar and Zebulun. Leah’s willingness to barter with her sister allowed her to attain precedence as the mother of six tribes and to merit burial at Jacob’s side (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 72.3).

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano7-3"><div class="tab-en"><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg29.jpg"/>I<small>N</small> G<small>ENESIS</small> 31, Jacob calls his wives Rachel and Leah out to the field and confidentially expresses his desire to return to Canaan. <i>Vataan Rachel v’Leah</i> (31:14): Rachel and Leah respond in one voice—as indicated by the singular verb form—expressing a shared anger against their father and a willingness to leave Haran. Jacob then gets up, places his wives and sons on camels, carries off his cattle and other property, and departs.
</div><div class="tab-en1">At first, Jacob appears as the central actor in this narrative. Everything is said and done in relation to him, stated in masculine possessive terms. In 31:19, however, Rachel seizes the opportunity afforded by Laban’s going off to shear his sheep to steal her father’s <i>t’rafim.</i> Until this point, Rachel and Leah have followed a course initiated by Jacob and his concerns. Here, however, Rachel initiates and plots her own destiny. So much so that in the next verse Jacob is seen as following Rachel’s lead: Rachel stole the <i>t’rafim</i> (v. 19) and Jacob “stole the mind (literally: heart) of Laban the Aramean” (v. 20).
</div><div class="tab-en1">Jacob re-assumes center stage in the narrative when Laban overtakes him on his journey and the two men begin to air their respective grievances. But from the moment Rachel steals the <i>t’rafim,</i> Jacob ceases to control the action or facts. It is in a condition of ironic ignorance that Jacob makes his rash pronouncement (v. 32): “But the one with whom you find your gods shall not live.” (Compare Jephthah’s vow in Judges 11:30 to sacrifice the first to come out to meet him, a vow that leads him to sacrifice his daughter.)
</div><div class="tab-en1">Several midrashic sources contend that Jacob’s death sentence for the theft of Laban’s <i>t’rafim</i> is borne out in Rachel’s tragic death after giving birth to Benjamin (for example, <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 74.32). According to a plain reading of Genesis 31, however, Rachel emerges from the episode victorious and unscathed. After all, Jacob’s curse is conditioned upon Laban actually finding the <i>t’rafim</i> in someone’s possession— something that Laban never accomplishes.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Laban conducts a thorough search of Jacob’s camp: Jacob’s tent, Leah’s, the two maidservants’, and Rachel’s—<i>v’lo matza</i> (and he finds nothing), a verb construction that appears three times (31:33, 34, 35). What has Rachel done to elude her father? She has placed the <i>t’rafim</i> in a camel’s saddle (echoing how Jacob put his wives and sons onto camels in v. 17) and conceals them by sitting on this same saddle. She then shrewdly apologizes to her father for not obeying usual custom and rising before him as he searches her tent. “The way of women is upon me” (31:35), Rachel claims, cunningly manipulating the (male) menstruation taboo to her own advantage.

</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">What are these <i>t’rafim</i> that Rachel risks so much to steal? What did they stand for in Rachel’s time, and what do they mean for us today?
</div><div class="tab-en1">According to Rashi, the 11th-century commentator, the <i>t’rafim</i> were household idols that Rachel steals from her father for pious, monotheistic reasons: “in order to distance him from the practice of idol worship.” This interpretation clearly stems from rabbinic discomfort with the idea of Rachel as idol worshipper. But if Rachel were so angry with her father as to be willing to leave his house forever without so much as a goodbye, would she really care about his spiritual fate?
</div><div class="tab-en1">Based on other instances in the Bible where the same word appears, other traditional exegetes identify the <i>t’rafim</i> with the practice of divination. Thus, Rachel steals the <i>t’rafim,</i> which were used by ancient magicians as a means of telling the future, in order to prevent Laban from knowing Jacob’s plans or whereabouts. If that were the case, however, Rachel should have simply broken them. Why does she go to the trouble of stealing them, hiding them in a saddle, and tricking her father?
</div><div class="tab-en1">Several contemporary biblical scholars have argued that possession of the “household gods” was related to issues of clan leadership or inheritance. Accordingly, the <i>t’rafim</i> are symbolic tokens that indicate Rachel’s right to take her children and possessions away from her father and hand them over to her husband. And yet, Rachel’s decision not to inform Jacob of her theft of the <i>t’rafim</i> suggests that she acts for her own sake, not Jacob’s.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Along these lines, feminist biblical scholar J. E. Lapsley argues that Rachel steals the <i>t’rafim</i> because her status as a woman in a patriarchal household prevents her from confronting her father with her own grievances about her rightful inheritance. “Therefore, she goes about getting justice from her father through devious and extra-legal means” (“The Voice of Rachel,” <i>Genesis: A Feminist Companion to the Bible (Second Series),</i> ed. Athalya Brenner, 1998, p. 238). In telling her father that she cannot “rise before” him because the “way of women is upon her,” Rachel is “speaking two languages simultaneously.” Laban hears Rachel as saying that she cannot honor him by standing because she is menstruating. But Rachel’s speech also reads as a complaint that she has no forum for rising before her father and pleading her case for inheritance; the social “way of women” constrains her possibilities for speech, advocacy, and direct action. According to Lapsley, Rachel’s “subversive action in stealing the <i>t’rafim</i> is matched by her equally subversive undermining of male definitions of women and her creation of new meanings out of male-generated language” (p. 242). According to this interpretation, Rachel steals not only the <i>t’rafim</i> but also the <i>language</i> that has been used by this patriarchy to define her as woman and limit her access to culture and law.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Rachel thus emerges from this story as an archetypal feminist writer, who dares to steal across the border of masculine culture, seize control of her cultural inheritance, and make it her own. Understood this way, the theft of the <i>t’rafim</i> becomes a story about women’s potential to use and craft language, both holy and mundane, in all of its many meanings, to speak potently—and cause others to listen.
