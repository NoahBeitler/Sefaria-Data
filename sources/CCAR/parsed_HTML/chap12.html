<div class="chap2" id="ch-12"><i>Intimations of the Exodus: the Death of Jacob, the Birth of Israel
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>A-Y’CHI</small> (“he lived,” referring to Jacob’s residing in Egypt) serves as a transition between the stories in Genesis about the patriarchs and Joseph, and the narrative in Exodus of the Egyptian slavery and exodus. It is both a conclusion and a foreshadowing. As the end of Jacob’s life draws near, he wants to ensure the continuity of the family. Consequently, in this parashah the present points to both the past and the future. The past is represented by the patriarchal blessing, which features the divine promises of progeny made to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; the future, by Jacob’s blessings for his own and for Joseph’s sons.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Along with the concern for the family is the concern for the land, since both are part of the patriarchal blessing. In making arrangements for his own burial, Jacob insists that he must be laid to rest in the family plot established by Abraham in Canaan, in the cave of Machpelah purchased from Ephron the Hittite (see Genesis 23). Although the entire family now resides in Egypt, this will not be their final resting-place. The parashah foreshadows the Exodus: Jacob’s burial procession from Egypt to Canaan anticipates the Israelites’ march out of Egypt. But the family’s return to Egypt, and Joseph’s temporary burial there, show that the real exodus is yet to come.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Joseph plays the leading role among the brothers. He has matured, and he now takes responsibility for his family. He is the one first charged with Jacob’s burial instructions, and he is the one who makes sure they are carried out. He also assures his brothers that he bears them no enmity for past deeds. With the death of their father, the brothers are now a reunited family.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The matriarchs are the only women mentioned in this parashah, and only in reference to their place of burial. Jacob recalls Rachel’s death on the way to Canaan (48:7). While instructing that he be buried in the cave of Machpelah, Jacob mentions that Sarah (along with Abraham), Rebekah (along with Isaac), and Leah are already buried there (49:29–32). Rebekah’s and Leah’s deaths have not been mentioned previously, whereas Sarah’s death received close attention (Genesis 23).

</div><div class="tab-en1">In death and burial, the matriarchs and patriarchs represent the uniting of the family in the Promised Land. Eventually, all Israel will reside in the land. But it will remain for the book of Exodus—where women once again will be very much in the foreground—to continue the story.

</div><div class="tab-en">The patriarch turns his attention to his legacy. Jacob’s first concern is his final resting-place (47:28–31); he insists that it be in the location that his grandfather Abraham had dedicated. Jacob’s second concern for legacy involves assigning heirs, which prompts him to make special provisions for Joseph’s two sons (48:1–20). His third concern, combining elements of the first two, is that his descendants return to their ancestral land and live there (48:21–22).
</div><div class="tab-en1">One aspect of the desires that Jacob expresses has since been echoed by pious Jews through the ages and in our own day: to be buried in the Land of Israel. On the ancient norm of burial in a family plot or cave, rather than in a communal cemetery, see Another View.
</div><div class="head2" id="ge_47.28-31">JACOB PREPARES FOR DEATH AND BURIAL (47:28–31)
</div><b>Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years.</b> The period is noted as if to say that it formed a separate chapter in his life.<br></br><i><b>Jacob’s days—the years of his life—were 147.</b></i> The narration begins a formulaic summary of Jacob’s lifetime, but it will not actually relate his demise until much later (49:33; compare 25:7–8; 35:28–29). This parashah thus zooms in on the relatively brief moment in Jacob’s existence that lies in between.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="47:29–31" ref="47:29"> These burial instructions mention neither the locale of the ancestral resting-place nor even the country where it is located. What Jacob emphasizes is that burial must not be in Egypt (stated twice), and that Joseph must swear to carry out these instructions. Compare the reiterations at 49:29–32 and 50:5; see the comments there.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="47:29"> It is the duty of sons to bury their father: Isaac and Ishmael buried Abraham (25:9), and Esau and Jacob buried Isaac (35:29). But Jacob does not summon all his sons; he summons only Joseph— child of his beloved Rachel—his favorite son and the one of highest status in Egypt.<br></br>Later, when Joseph himself is about to die, he will utter a similar statement: “I am dying, but God will surely take care of you and bring you up out of this land to the land that [God] promised to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob” (50:24).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="47:29"><b>“put your hand under my thigh.”</b> This act and the accompanying verbal oath (v. 31) comprise the swearing that Jacob requires; compare Abraham’s procedure when he sent his slave to secure a wife for Isaac (24:2–3, 9).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="47:30"><b>“ancestors.”</b> [Heb. <i>avot,</i> often translated as “fathers.” See at 25:8. —<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="48:3–4" ref="48:3"><div class="head2" id="ge_48.1-20">JACOB BLESSES EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH (48:1–20)
</div> Jacob repeats God’s promise to the patriarchs of progeny and land. Both are in play here. Jacob’s insistence on being buried in Canaan foreshadows the permanent settlement in the Promised Land. His “adoption” of Joseph’s two sons points to progeny and family continuity.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="48:5"><b>“your two sons…they are mine.”</b> Another grandparent (or substitute grandparent) who is considered to be like a parent is Naomi in Ruth 4:17, where the women declare of the son of Ruth and Boaz: “A son is born to Naomi.” In our verse, Jacob equates Ephraim and Manasseh with Reuben and Simeon, his own first- and second-born sons.<br></br>Jacob has lifted Ephraim and Manasseh from the genealogy of Joseph and placed them in his own genealogical list. He does so in memory, as it were, of Rachel, Joseph’s mother. This is a strong statement of family continuity—from Jacob to Joseph to Joseph’s sons, a male genealogy inspired by a woman. In later biblical tradition Rachel is the mother of the northern tribes, symbolized by the “Joseph” tribes. Thus we read: “A voice is heard in Ramah / <i>…</i> Rachel is weeping for her children, / refusing to be comforted” (Jeremiah 31:14); the passage concludes with a promise that her children will be restored (“your children shall return to their own borders,” v. 16).<br></br>If we view Genesis 48 as a late retrojection, reflecting the tribes that settled in Canaan, then this is an etiology for how Ephraim and Manasseh—who were not sons of Jacob like the rest of the tribes’ eponyms—came to be tribes. Jacob’s bestowal on Ephraim of the birthright reflects the later reality: Ephraim the tribe became the largest and most influential in the northern kingdom.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="48:6"><b>“progeny…after them.”</b> No further progeny is known. If Joseph were to have subsequent sons, they would not form separate tribes bearing their names but would be included in the twelve tribes.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="48:7" ref="48:7"><b>48:7. “And I—.”</b> In thinking about his own death and burial, Jacob suddenly recalls the death and burial of his beloved wife.<br></br><i><b>“Rachel died in the land of Canaan.”</b></i> Joseph’s mother was not buried in the ancestral cave of Machpelah. (On its purchase and Sarah’s burial there, see Genesis 23.) Her passing, first recounted in 35:16–20, is repeated here with the addition of this notice. This mention of Canaan re-emphasizes the idea of burial in Canaan that marked Jacob’s earlier instructions.<br></br><i><b>“Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem.”</b></i> See Ruth 4:11, which mentions both Rachel and Leah as it links Ruth with Ephrathah, which is Bethlehem.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="48:8–20" ref="48:8"> The bestowing of a blessing and a birthright, and bestowing it upon the “wrong” son, recalls Jacob’s bargain to obtain the birthright from Esau (Genesis 25:29–34), his deception to obtain the blessing from his father, and the compensatory blessing granted to Esau (Genesis 27). The blessing here reiterates the patriarchal promise and again—as in the preceding passage—emphasizes the continuity from Abraham through Joseph’s sons.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="48:8–10" ref="48:8"> Jacob appears confused here, as if forgetting that he had just seen Joseph’s sons and spoken about them at length. Modern critical scholars smooth the rough edges of this narrative sequence by suggesting that verse 8 is the continuation of verse 2, and that verses 3-7 are an insertion from a different source, interpreting the original scene.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="48:15"><b>He then blessed Joseph.</b> He does so through his blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh (v. 16, “bless these lads”).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="48:16"><b>“let them greatly multiply within the land.”</b> Jacob passes on the patriarchal blessing to the next generations: he recalls the names of Abraham and Isaac, and God’s promises of land and progeny.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="48:19"> Jacob refuses Joseph’s attempt to correct the order of precedence of the children. The same Jacob who supplanted his own older brother once again puts the younger before the older. The switching of places of Ephraim and Manasseh also invokes the common theme in Genesis of the younger sibling taking precedence over the older: Isaac over Ishmael (Genesis 21); Jacob over Esau (Genesis 27); Rachel over Leah (31:4); Tamar’s son Perez over Zerah (38:27–30). (The theme is also a popular one elsewhere in the Bible. But in the story of Leah and Rachel, Laban reverses the theme, using the priority of Leah to trick Jacob; 29:26.)</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="48:22" ref="48:22"><div class="head2" id="ge_48.21-22">JACOB RESUMES HIS PREPARATIONS FOR DEATH (48:21–22)
</div><b>48:22. “Shechem mountain-ridge.”</b> Heb. <i>sh’chem echad</i>, a difficult phrase. Many commentators understand it to mean “one portion,” or the double portion assigned to the first-born (Deuteronomy 21:17). Others, including our translator, read it in terms of the walled town of Shechem, in the vicinity of which Jacob had once settled and even purchased land (Genesis 33:18–19). It is the locale where Jacob had sent Joseph when his brothers were pasturing flocks there (37:13), and where Joseph would eventually be buried (Joshua 24:32). According to the Bible’s allotment of Canaan by tribe, Shechem sits in the territory of Manasseh—one of Joseph’s sons—which would later become part of the northern kingdom of Israel. It is the same town where the story of Dinah takes place, and the name of the prince who lies with her (see at Genesis 34).<br></br><i><b>“which I won…with my sword and my bow.”</b></i> This clause strengthens the argument that the previous phrase refers to a location. There is, however, no record of Jacob’s having fought to obtain land.<br></br><i><b>“Amorites.”</b></i> Another name for the indigenous inhabitants of Canaan.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:4"><div class="head2a"><i>Jacob’s Deathbed Blessing</i> (49:1–27)
</div><div class="tab-en">This is a laconic and therefore difficult poem; a number of verses remain poorly understood. In it, Jacob sets the future course of his sons—the eponyms of the tribes of Israel. It reflects a later time, after the tribes have settled in the land, but here its panoramic view is retrojected into a last will and testament of the patriarch. It has political overtones, putting some tribes in a more favorable light than others. Yet the overall effect—like so much in this parashah—is to foreshadow the fulfillment of the patriarchal promise: it depicts Israel settled in its land.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Such a testament is a well-known literary trope. A counterpart is found in Deuteronomy 33, in Moses’ farewell blessing of Israel, in which the tribes are blessed as if they are his own sons. Ancient post-biblical literature elaborated on this genre, composing testaments for the Twelve Patriarchs—the twelve sons of Jacob—as well as for other biblical figures like Moses, Solomon, and Job.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The sons are listed roughly by the mothers who bore them. Leah’s children appear first (Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar) followed by Zilpah’s and Bilhah’s sons (Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali), and culminating in Rachel’s sons (Joseph, Benjamin). But the order does not follow exactly the birth order in the stories in Genesis 29, 30, and 35. Despite the adoption of Ephraim and Manasseh in the foregoing section, they are not mentioned in this poem.
</div><div class="tab-en1">In some cases, the blessing includes the tribal totem or symbol. For example, Judah is a lion; Zebulun is associated with ships; Dan is a serpent; Benjamin is a wolf. (Through the ages, these symbols have been used by various artists, such as Chagall in his famous Hadassah Hospital windows in Jerusalem.) The poem often invokes wordplay on the sons’ names.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Taken as a whole, this poem privileges Judah and Joseph—symbols of the later southern and northern Israelite kingdoms, respectively. It thereby looks beyond the tribal land allotments to the time of the divided monarchy, when the individual tribes had little significance, having been replaced by the two more centralized polities. Some scholars read the poem as promoting Judah over Joseph, implying an even later perspective when the northern kingdom had been destroyed and Judah alone was left (D. Carr, <i>Reading the Fractures of Genesis,</i> 1996, p. 250).
</div><b>“you mounted your father’s bed.”</b> An allusion to when Reuben slept with his father’s concubine (35:22). Such an act is taken elsewhere as a sign of wishing to supplant the father (II Samuel 16:20–22; I Kings 2:20–22). This verse might be an attempt to explain why Reuben, although the first-born of Jacob, was not to become a historically important tribe.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="49:5–7" ref="49:5"> The allusion is to Genesis 34, the Dinah story, in which Simeon and Levi arrange for the massacre of the men of Shechem. Here, as in the earlier account, Jacob’s assessment differs from that of these two brothers.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:7"><b>“I will disperse them in Jacob, / scatter them in Israel.”</b> They would not remain distinct tribes. Simeon was absorbed into the tribe of Judah; and Levi—the tribe from which the Levites and priests would come—did not have landholdings.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="49:9–10" ref="49:9"> The blessings of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi disqualify those three oldest sons, leaving Judah to serve as the leading tribe—securing the birthright, as it were.<br></br><i><b>“lion’s cub…lion…lioness.”</b></i> The “king of beasts” is an appropriate emblem for Judah, the tribe linked with the Davidic kingship—an eternal dynasty.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:10"><b>“until he comes to Shiloh.”</b> This last part of the verse is obscure; it has been interpreted as having messianic meaning.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="49:11–12" ref="49:11"> This blessing’s emphasis on wine suggests agricultural fertility, as well as luxury and festive banqueting.

It is not clear whether it is positive or negative.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:18"> This verse breaks away from the main poem and has been explained as an interpolation from elsewhere (see Psalm 119:166). In its present location, it might be seen as an aside by Jacob, calling on God’s help.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:19"> This verse features repeated wordplay on the name of Gad, built on the root letters <i>g-w-d.</i></div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="49:22" ref="49:22"><b>49:22. “wild she-ass’s son.”</b> Or, “a fruitful bough.” Both interpretations have been offered for this difficult phrase. In either case, the image is one of vigor.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:23"> The poetry now transmutes the animal or floral image of the preceding verse into a human archer-warrior who, although having been set upon by enemies, was able to remain steady. We have no inkling of the referent of this image; the Bible nowhere else mentions Joseph as a warrior or archer. It may refer to the later history of the northern kingdom, given that the “Joseph” tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh settled in the central part of the country and dominated it politically.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="49:24–26" ref="49:24"> Jacob heaps the greatest blessing upon Joseph.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:24"><b>“Mighty One of Jacob…Shepherd…Rock.”</b> The poetry invokes several ancient divine epithets.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:25"><b>“Shaddai.”</b> One of God’s names, often associated with fertility.<br></br><i><b>“heaven above…deep…below.”</b></i> The entire cosmos, from the heavens above to the primeval waters below, participates in the blessing.<br></br><i><b>“blessings of breasts and womb.”</b></i> This unusual reference signals fertility.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:26"><b>“my parents’ blessings.”</b> The blessing on Joseph, says Jacob, will surpass the blessing he received from his own parents; that is to say, the blessing of Joseph will surpass the promise to the patriarchs. Interestingly, Jacob does not use the Hebrew word <i>avot</i> (“ancestors”) but <i>horai</i>—here translated as “parents”—a term related to pregnancy.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:28"><div class="head2a"><i>Jacob Imparts Instructions for His Burial</i> (49:28–33)
</div><div class="tab-en">The narrative returns to the issue of Jacob’s instructions for his burial that has occupied so much of this parashah. Here, as opposed to 47:30, Jacob addresses all his sons—not Joseph alone—and he details the location of the burial place and the family members who have already been laid to rest in it. The deceased matriarchs figure as prominently as the patriarchs. Indeed, it was the death of Sarah that had necessitated acquiring this family plot. (Genesis 23:3–15 recounts the purchase of this site—the first land acquisition in the Promised Land, and the first step in the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham.) In death, as in life, the matriarchs are the cement that provides family continuity.
</div><b>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel.</b> This summation acknowledges that the poem refers not to Jacob’s sons themselves but to the future of the tribes. By putting the future of the tribes in the form of this testament, it suggests that what befell the tribes was fitting to the character of each; it was their destiny. The Bible often explains and justifies a current situation as if it had been predicted prophetically.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="49:29–32" ref="49:29"> Jacob’s words are not meant simply to provide instructions on how to find the burial plot. By retelling the story of the site, Jacob appeals for family continuity—for the preservation of this burial tradition. (How often thoughts of family continuity and traditional practice come at the moment of death, when an important link in the chain is about to be lost!)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:29"><b>“my people.”</b> See at 25:8.<br></br><i><b>“ancestors.”</b></i> [Heb. <i>avot,</i> often translated as “fathers.” See at 25:8. —<i>Ed</i>.]</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="49:33"><b>he drew his feet into the bed.</b> This action complements that of 48:2, when Jacob “sat up in the bed.” His instructions are now complete; he can die in peace knowing that he has conveyed his wishes to his sons.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-en1" ref="50:2"><div class="head2a"><i>Jacob’s Funeral and Burial</i> (50:1–13)
</div><div class="tab-en">The narrative spotlight now shifts from Jacob to Joseph. He takes the lead in mourning for Jacob and in making arrangements to carry out his father’s last wishes.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Some of the confusion in this unit—especially in reference to Joseph’s acting alone versus all the brothers—is explained by modern critical scholars as the result of the combination of different sources, Priestly and non-Priestly accounts.
</div><b>his servants the physicians.</b> Apparently Joseph had his own staff of physicians. Knowledge of anatomy is necessary for embalming, during which the internal organs are removed.<br></br><i><b>to embalm his father.</b></i> An Egyptian practice that conforms to Egyptian religious thought about the afterworld. This is one of several features in the Joseph story that reflects its Egyptian setting. Except for Jacob and Joseph, no other Israelites in the Bible are embalmed. Later Jewish law forbade attempts to preserve a corpse (except in extreme circumstances), since normally Jews are to be buried quickly.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="50:3"> The forty days of embalming were followed by thirty (or, per the present translation, seventy) days of public mourning: Jacob, because of his relation to Joseph, was treated as a quasi-royal figure.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="50:4–6" ref="50:4"> Only after concluding the period of mourning does Joseph begin arrangements for the burial. Here Egyptian custom ends and Jacob’s instructions begin to be carried out. Yet the Egyptian setting of the story is still in evidence in Joseph’s carefully crafted words, seeking permission to bury his father in Canaan. Here—as often in the Bible—the narrative repeats a character’s speech with changes that adjust it to its changing audience. Three times the text relates Jacob’s burial instructions (47:29–30; 49:29–32; and here), and each time the wording is different, because both the purpose of the speech and the recipients of the information have changed. Joseph must obtain permission from Pharaoh, so he uses a strategy and language that will accomplish his goal.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="50:4"><b>Pharaoh’s household.</b> Joseph does not approach Pharaoh directly but through his official court, whom he asks to convey his request to Pharaoh. (This seems strange, given Joseph’s high status as second only to Pharaoh.)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="50:5"><b>“My father adjured me, saying…”</b> Joseph does not repeat the exact wording of the oath he swore to his father. He changes it so as to make it sound more positive: “bury me in Canaan” rather than “don’t bury me in Egypt.” It is not as if Jacob specifically rejected Egypt, but that he preferred Canaan. Joseph speaks here as a loyal Egyptian merely doing his filial duty.<br></br><i><b>“‘acquired’”</b></i> Heb. <i>kariti,</i> literally “dug” or perhaps “prepared.” There is no prior notice that Jacob had prepared his grave in any way. This suggests that, as this translation reflects, it was the location that was important to Jacob himself—not the structure of the grave. (On the burial details, see Another View.) But Joseph has designed <i>his</i> words to appeal to a pharaoh. High-ranking Egyptians had elaborate tombs prepared for themselves many years before their death. Therefore, we should take the word <i>kariti</i> literally: Joseph is making it sound as if his father, too, followed Egyptian custom, but with an Israelite twist—burial in the ground rather than in a pyramid. Pharaoh could predictably relate to this request of Joseph’s, to honor his father by burying him in the “tomb” specially prepared for him.<br></br><i><b>“then I will come back.”</b></i> Joseph’s loyalty is again evident in these words. After the burial Joseph will resume his place in Egypt. Indeed, he and his brothers do return (v. 14), for although the funeral procession foreshadows the Exodus, it is, as it were, only a rehearsal for it (see below on vv. 8, 10).</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="50:7–9" ref="50:7"> Like the period of mourning, the funeral and burial involve a large entourage, including Egyptians. This is a state funeral. In fact, the Canaanites perceive it as “a solemn mourning for Egypt” (v. 11).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="50:8"><b>They left in Goshen only their little ones, their flocks, and their cattle.</b> While this is not yet the Exodus, the language foreshadows the struggle to take the children and livestock in Exodus 10:9–11, 24. As for women, it seems likely that most remained with the children, while at least a few of them featured in the funeral and burial ceremonies (see at v. 10, “lamentation”).</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="50:10" ref="50:10"><b>50:10. Goren ha-Atad.</b> A place name not otherwise known.<br></br><i><b>on the other side of the Jordan.</b></i> The route through Transjordan is not a direct route from Egypt to the cave of Machpelah. This route foreshadows that of the Israelite exodus, which also wound its way through Transjordan.<br></br><i><b>they.</b></i> Presumably referring to the brothers and the Egyptians, or perhaps only the Egyptians.<br></br><i><b>lamentation.</b></i> A specialty of women; the public voice of mourning in the ancient Near East was both female and male (see <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Contemporary Reflection, and at Leviticus 10:6).<br></br><i><b>mourning ceremony.</b></i> The translation “ceremony” suggests that the mourning period observed by Joseph included still more lamentation. Alternatively, Joseph observed “a seven-day period of mourning” of an unspecified type.<br></br><i><b>seven days.</b></i> A mourning period of seven days is known from the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh, and in the Bible also from the mourning for Saul (I Samuel 31:13) and from Job’s friends (Job 2:13). It became shivah, the traditional period for Jewish mourning that begins after the burial. Here, however, Jacob has not yet been buried (see v. 13). Alternatively, this verse reflects an alternate tradition which has Jacob buried at Goren ha-Atad, followed by the period of mourning.

</div><div class="head2" id="ge_vv.14-21">BROTHERLY RECONCILIATION (50:14–21)
</div><div class="tab-en1">Just as at the beginning of the story the brothers plotted against Joseph and fabricate a speech (Genesis 37), so they do at the end, although much more benignly. Worried now that after Jacob’s death, Joseph will take revenge on them for all the trouble they caused him, they introduce a hitherto unacknowledged deathbed speech of Jacob. The brothers claim that Jacob told them to tell Joseph that he should forgive his brothers.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The brothers’ claim is implausible; why did Jacob not tell this directly to Joseph? It is better to conclude that Jacob never said this and that the brothers made it up. (Compare Bathsheba’s making up a speech that her husband, King David, was supposed to have said, designating Solomon as heir; I Kings 1.) The language is overly formal, and one can imagine how stiffly and nervously the words were delivered.
</div><div class="tab-en1">But this lie is in essence true. The brothers have repented—and Joseph knows it. He cries when they say this. He will not hold their past actions against them.

Here Jacob insists on being buried in the cave of Machpelah, near Hebron, where his ancestors and his wife Leah are already buried (49:29–32).
</div><div class="tab-en1">To flesh out the role of the dead in Israelite society, biblical testimony can be combined with archeological evidence. According to Jacob’s statement, his family buried its members together: all the matriarchs and patriarchs were interred in the Cave of Machpelah, with the exception of Rachel. That tomb both substantiated the inheritance claim and served as a boundary marker; through his purchase of the field and cave, Abraham had established Israelite claim to territory near Hebron (Genesis 23).
</div><div class="tab-en1">Burial in a cave conforms to actual interment practices in the Hebron region from pre-Israelite times to the fall of the Davidic kingdom (ca. 1800–586 <small>B.C.E.).</small> The local residents indeed buried their family members—including children—together in either natural caves or roughly hewn chambers. Alongside their deceased, they placed ceramic vessels for food and drink, lamps, tools, and personal items. In the 8th and 7th centuries <small>B.C.E.,</small> they occasionally provided also a clay female figurine—crudely formed, with little distinguished besides a head (sometimes schematic) and prominent breasts.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Grave goods suggest that the dead were considered to continue some form of existence. Many scholars—but by no means all—identify the female figurines with the fertility goddess Asherah, speculating that perhaps a figurine conveyed the wishes of the living for the dead to intercede on their behalf with God (and Asherah) to promote lactation for children’s welfare. Biblical passages likewise attribute ongoing benevolent powers to the deceased. Repeated admonitions not to consult the dead—rather than God—on behalf of the living (Deuteronomy 18:11), the woman of En-dor conjuring up the deceased Samuel to foretell the future (I Samuel 28), and the Israelite house-holder’s annual declaration that no tithed food had been given to the dead (Deuteronomy 26:14) are just three examples of belief in the continuing powers of the dead and the practices of reaching out to them.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano12-2"><div class="tab-en"><i><b>“treat me with faithful kindness”</b></i> (47:29). In giving his burial instructions, Jacob asks to be treated with <i>chesed v’emet</i>. The Midrash asks why Jacob uses this expression—is there really such a thing as <i>unfaithful</i> kindness? Rather, Jacob’s words come to teach that truly faithful kindness is that which the living show the dead (<i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 96.5). Consider that when a person shows kindness to someone living, no one knows for certain what that person’s motivation is; perhaps there is a hope for a favor in return. Furthermore, the outcome of that action is uncertain; while intended to be kind, it may result in harm or pain. But the kindness shown to a dead person—in the form of burial and a eulogy—is always true kindness. In addition, it is disinterested; one expects no favors from the dead (<i>Itturei Torah</i>).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>“Rachel died…on the road”</b></i> (48:7). Jacob had once before pressed Joseph to bury him in his ancestral burial plot (47:28–30). The commentators ask why Jacob only now—and not in that earlier scene—discusses his decision to bury Rachel at the roadside (rather than in the cave of Machpelah). One commentator argues that there was room in the cave of Machpelah only for Jacob and one of his wives. Up until now, Joseph had accepted the fact that Leah—as Jacob’s senior wife and the mother of his oldest sons—was entitled to that place. However, Jacob has since adopted Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, saying that they “will be to me as Reuben and Simeon” (48:5). With his sons recognized as the equals of his father’s oldest sons, Joseph then must have inquired why his mother should not henceforth be viewed as Jacob’s senior wife—and so be entitled to burial by his side. Therefore, Jacob now explains his decision to bury Rachel near Ephrath <i>(Itturei Torah).</i>
</div><div class="tab-en1">In defending his decision, Jacob explains that Rachel is destined to be an intercessor for her descendants (and, in fact, for all Israel). When the Israelites are conquered by the Babylonians, they will pass Rachel’s tomb on their way into exile. Rachel will then mediate on their behalf, beseeching God to have compassion on her children (a rabbinic understanding of Jeremiah 31:15–17). Rachel, rather than any other matriarch, is chosen as Israel’s intercessor because of her compassion for her sister, and her willingness to overcome her jealousy, when Leah married Jacob by subterfuge <i>(Itturei Torah,</i> citing Rashi and <i>Eichah Rabbah,</i> proem 24; see parashat Vayeitzei at 29:25).
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>“Rachel died.”</b></i> Heb. <i>metah alai Rachel,</i> literally “Rachel died on me” or “…upon me.” According to <i>Rut Rabbah</i> 2, the preposition indicates that Jacob sees Rachel’s death as a “greater grief than all his other misfortunes.” Another rabbinic tradition construes the preposition as a reminder that a woman’s death is painful especially to her husband (BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 22b). The same teaching meanwhile derives the parallel lesson—that a man’s death pains his wife more than anyone else—from Ruth 1:3, “And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died…” because that verse identifies him in terms of her.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>“By you”</b></i> (48:20). In his commentary on this parashah, Rashi cites this verse as the source for the custom of blessing sons with the words “May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.”
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>blessing each one</b></i> (49:28). How could Jacob have “blessed” Simeon and Levi, given the harsh words he directed toward them (49:5–7)? One interpreter of this verse suggests that Jacob’s rebuke of his sons was, in fact, a blessing. In cursing their anger specifically—rather than his sons—Jacob sought to temper it, and to encourage them to distance themselves from their inappropriate behaviors. In this sense, his criticism was intended as a blessing, offering his sons a chance to renounce their past actions and become better people <i>(Itturei Torah).</i>
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>“Please…forgive…your brothers”</b></i> (50:17). Given that the narrative did not mention Jacob’s having dispatched this exact message, Rabbi Eleazar son of Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai sees this verse as proof that one may alter another person’s words for the sake of peace (BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 65b); the brothers’ claim made it easier for them to approach Joseph and easier for him to respond positively.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>“I will provide”</b></i> (50:21). Commentators wonder why Joseph promised to care for his brothers’ children. The brothers believed that the compassion Joseph had shown them since their arrival in Egypt reflected his duty to them as his older brothers. They feared that when they died, Joseph’s anger at them for selling him into slavery would emerge and be directed at their children. Joseph reassures them; not only does he have no intention of harming them, but he plans to care for their children even after their death (<i>Itturei Torah).</i>

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano12-3"><div class="tab-en">V<small>A-Y’CHI SPEAKS OF BLESSINGS</small>, of a grandfather blessing his grandsons, a father blessing his sons. Imagine the scene at the end of the Torah portion: Jacob, whose name has been changed to Israel, calls his twelve sons to his deathbed and blesses each one of them. But his real concern, according to our rabbis, is that his sons will abandon his God after he has died. In the Midrash, his sons respond to this unstated fear with words that have become familiar to us: “<i>Sh’ma Yisrael</i> (Listen, [Dad—whose name is] Israel!): יהוה is our God, only יהוה.” Hearing this, the dying patriarch sighs quietly: “<i>Baruch shem k’vod malchuto l’olam va’ed</i> (Blessed is the glorious Name whose kingdom is forever and ever)!” (Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 98.4). Each time we say the <i>Sh’ma</i>, we are rehearsing this moment. We are the children acknowledging the God of our own father, and we are pledging our own loyalty to the tradition of ancestors.
</div><div class="tab-en1">This farewell scene cannot fail to move us. But it is also confusing. Jacob also has daughters, and the one named Dinah is no longer in the story. Is she not worthy of blessing?
</div><div class="tab-en1">The question of blessing our daughters emerges by way of omission. Jacob and the rest of his family have been reunited with Joseph after many years (Genesis 46). The beloved child Joseph, whom Jacob thought was dead, is not only still alive, but he is a father, with children of his own!
</div><div class="tab-en1">Now, facing death, Jacob says: “I never thought I’d see your face again, and look, God has enabled me to see the face of your children!” (48:8–12). Joseph brings his sons close to his father, with Manasseh, the elder, first. Jacob crosses his arms, putting his right hand on Ephraim’s head, and his left on Manasseh’s. Joseph intervenes, “Not that way, Father! This is my first-born; put your right hand on his head.” But Jacob wants to put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. Then Jacob blesses them both together with these words: “By you shall the people of Israel give their blessing, saying, ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh’” (48:18–20).
</div><div class="tab-en1">Why does Jacob bless his younger grandson first? It is hard to imagine this blessing without recalling the earlier moment when Jacob himself stole the blessing that his father Isaac meant for his older brother Esau. In blessing his grandsons, is Jacob repairing his own history, doing intentionally what Isaac did by accident? Is Jacob asserting through his act of blessing that birth order no longer determines one’s destiny—and that blessing is an act of will as opposed to an accident of chance?
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">The story raises other questions. Jacob’s blessing of his grandsons has become over the centuries the blessing bestowed regularly upon boys; but what is it about Ephraim and Manasseh that merits our blessing our sons in their name? And what about our daughters?
</div><div class="tab-en1">We do not know much about these two young men. We meet them first when they are born (41:51–53), and we encounter them again at this moment of blessing. They are children of an Egyptian mother and a father who is one of the most powerful men in Egypt. They are children born in the Diaspora, not only Egyptian but also Israelite—children living in two worlds.
</div><div class="tab-en1">So why do we bless our sons in their name? Could it be because, like so many Jews throughout history, they grew up in the Diaspora and still remained Jews? Could it be because we imagine that they followed in their father’s footsteps—being part of Egyptian culture and politics—and yet still connected to their grandfather, part of Israel’s community?
</div><div class="tab-en1">Or perhaps we invoke Ephraim and Manasseh because these are the first two siblings in the Bible who do not fight. With Ephraim and Manasseh, the family pathology that unfolds in the book of Genesis, in which siblings struggle with each other, finally comes to an end. They teach us that we do not have to fight over blessings: there are enough of them to go around.
</div><div class="tab-en1">In the Middle Ages, the customary blessing of children took place before Kol Nidrei—the time when we are most aware of our mortality—a time reminiscent of Jacob’s deathbed blessings. In recent centuries, the tradition expanded to include blessing the children every Shabbat evening and on the evening of holidays. Whereas we continue to bless sons by reference to Ephraim and Manasseh (“May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh”), the tradition for our daughters is different; we bless them with these words: “May God make you like Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.”
</div><div class="tab-en1">Why are the blessings so different? Rabbi Richard Levy suggests the following contemporary reason for interpreting the difference:
</div><div class="tab-en1">“Just as Ephraim and Manasseh received their merit not through any acts of their own but only because they were alive and were descendants of Jacob (as are we all), so Jewish boys need not feel that their parents’ love is dependent on their accomplishments; they are beloved just because they are children. For Jewish girls, however, who might be inclined by society’s prejudices to think that because they are girls they need not set their sights very high, the blessing holds them up to the highest models: May God make you like the greatest women the Torah knows—Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah” (“Parashat Vayechi,” in <i>Learn Torah With…,</i> 1996, Vol. 2, No. 12).
</div><div class="tab-en1">As our community mores continue to evolve, one might claim that we now expect <i>both</i> our daughters and our sons to set their sights high. We also hope to create an environment where <i>both</i> daughters and sons feel valued simply because they are alive—and are our children. So perhaps there is yet another way to interpret these blessings, one that accounts for changes we value in our contemporary world.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Maybe we can understand Jacob’s blessing of his grandchildren this way: “Ephraim, may God help you become the best that Ephraim can be; Manasseh, may God help you become the best that Manasseh can be!” Maybe we should fill in the names of our own children as we bless them. So I would say to my daughter: “Elana, may you be fully Elana!” And to my son I would say: “Joshua, may you be fully Joshua!” Or, in the words of the modern Jewish poet Marcia Falk: “Be who you are…and may you be blessed in all that you are” (<i>The Book of Blessings,</i> 1996).
