</small><i>The Song of Moses: A Foretelling of Future Events
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> H<small>AAZINU</small> (“give ear”) tells of a relationship gone awry. According to the poem at the heart of this parashah, God had established a special relationship with the people Israel and then lovingly watched over and cared for them, yet they rejected God and turned to other deities. Enraged at their betrayal, God resolves to decimate Israel. But God relents when realizing that the other nations might foolishly misinterpret Israel’s demise as a result of their own power, not as a divinely inflicted punishment. Thus, with a change of heart, God decides instead to avenge the Israelites against their enemies.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In the prior parashah (<i>Vayeilech</i>), God predicted that after Moses’ death, the people would go astray by worshiping other deities, which would prompt God to punish them (31:16–18). To prevent any misunderstanding of these future events, God instructed Moses to write down a particular poem and teach it to the people so that it would serve as a “witness,” testifying to God’s justice in the face of Israel’s wayward behavior (31:19). That poem, which constitutes most of <i>parashat Haazinu</i> (32:1–43), is followed by a confirmation that Moses recites the poem to the people (32:44–47); then, the parashah looks ahead to Moses’ imminent death (32:48–52).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Although the poem is not titled in the biblical text, people refer to it as “the Song of Moses” or <i>“Shirat Haazinu</i>” (“the Song [that begins with the word] <i>Haazinu</i>”). In light of various linguistic and grammatical features, most scholars agree that the Song originated earlier than the rest of the book, as an independent composition. While a precise date remains uncertain, scholars assume that the poem was written in response to some tragedy, in an attempt to make sense of the event and provide hope for the future. Later, Deuteronomy’s creators appended this preexistent poem to the book in order to reinforce the consequences of breaking the Covenant, a central theme in Moses’ parting words to the people.

</div><div class="tab-enin">While the name “Song of Moses” implies that Moses wrote this poem, authorship of the Song cannot be determined. Note, however, that a number of biblical passages indicate that women were responsible for crafting and reciting similar sorts of poetic compositions. Various women in the Bible perform songs to celebrate military victories (Miriam in Exodus 15:20–21; Deborah in Judges 5; Jephthah’s daughter in Judges 11:34; and the women welcoming the heroes in I Samuel 18:6–7). Combining this textual evidence with other data, some scholars have concluded that another poem attributed to Moses, the Song at the Sea (Exodus 15:1–19), may have been authored by a woman (see pp. 386–87, 392). Other biblical texts indicate that women composed and chanted laments in times of national crisis or personal loss. For instance, God instructs the prophet Jeremiah to summon the “wailing women…the skillful ones” (Jeremiah 9:16). Jeremiah then calls all the women, not just the professional female mourners, to listen to God’s word and then teach their daughters and friends a dirge (9:19).
</div><div class="tab-enin">As <i>Shirat Haazinu</i> recounts the troubled relationship between God and Israel, it specifies that both women and men alike will inflame God’s anger (v. 19) and suffer God’s wrath (v. 25).
</div><div class="tab-enin">The Song employs diverse metaphors to describe the Divine. In addition to the genderneutral representations of God as a Rock (vv. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37) and as an eagle (v. 11), God appears as a father (v. 6), warrior (vv. 23, 41–42), and, most remarkably, a mother who gave birth to and nursed her child, Israel (vv. 13, 18).

</div><div class="head1">SHIRAT HAAZINU (32:1–43)
</div><div class="tab-en">S<i>hirat Haazinu</i> exhibits the defining features of biblical poetry, such as poetic parallelism, terseness, elevated diction, and various forms of repetition and patterning. Biblical poetry typically contains two, sometimes three, lines (called a “bicolon” or “tricolon” in the singular, and “bicola” and “tricola” in the plural) that relate to one another in a variety of ways. Parallel lines often appear to mirror one another, with one colon seeming to echo the general sentiment of the other, as in v. 2: “Like showers on young growth, / Like droplets on the grass.”
</div><div class="tab-enin">In other cases, while the lines as a whole may seem to be fairly synonymous, the individual word pairs within the parallel lines differ grammatically or semantically. For example, the two cola in v. 1 seem to be rather equivalent in terms of their overall meaning: “Give ear, O heavens, let me speak; / Let the earth hear the words I utter.” However, “heaven” and “earth” represent two distinct and complementary entities asked to listen the poet’s words. Plus, the end of the lines display a marked grammatical variance, for “let me speak” is a verbal phrase, whereas “the words I utter” (literally “the sayings of my mouth”) is a nominal (noun) phrase.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Elsewhere, the lines may not echo one another with any degree of grammatical or semantic equivalence or variation, but together may express a continuous idea, as in v. 8: “[God] fixed the boundaries of peoples / In relation to Israel’s numbers.” Being attentive to the dynamics of poetic parallelism can help the reader better understand this challenging text.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.1-3">INTRODUCTORY INVOCATION (32:1–13)
</div><div class="tab-enin">Previously in Deuteronomy, Moses summoned heaven and earth as witnesses to the terms of the covenant (4:26; 30:19; 31:28), similar to the convention found in ancient Near Eastern political treaties. Here, the poet invites heaven and earth to listen to the words that follow. These two terms form a merism, which is an expression that uses two extremes to indicate a totality (see also at Exodus 10:9 and 11:5). By invoking these two contrasting realms, the poet may also seek to call upon everything in between them, namely, the entire world. Four similes in v. 2 compare Moses’ words to water. Just as water is essential for sustaining life, so Moses hopes that the recitation of this message will enable Israel to “long endure on the land” that they prepare to enter (32:47).
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.4-14">RECOLLECTION OF GOD’S EARLY RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL (32:4–14)
</div><div class="tab-enin">The first part of this section (vv. 4–6) establishes a stark contrast between God and Israel: God is “upright” (v. 4), but Israel is “crooked” (v. 5); God’s deeds are “perfect” (v. 4), but Israel is “blemished” (rendered here as “unworthy,” v. 5); God is Israel’s “Father” (v. 6), but Israel is God’s “nonchildren” (see at v. 5 below). The second part of the section (vv. 7–14) utilizes various metaphors to recount the beneficent acts God performed on Israel’s behalf.
</div><b>The Rock!</b> The word “rock” <i>(tzur)</i> stands out as a key word in the Song, recurring eight times: once to designate a literal stone (v. 13), twice as an ironic reference to foreign gods (vv. 31, 37), and five times to depict the God of Israel (vv. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31).<br></br>The Bible portrays God metaphorically more than thirty times using the term <i>tzur,</i> which in such contexts conveys the image of a large rock formation or mountain. In the Psalms, <i>tzur</i> appears frequently as a divine name or epithet, as when a psalmist cries out to “my rock and my redeemer” (Psalm 19:15) or praises “my strength…my fortress, my rescuer, my God, my rock in whom I seek refuge” (Psalm 18:23). In the present verse, however, “the Rock” appears in conjunction with other words that highlight God’s steadfast loyalty and righteousness.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:5"><b></b> Various proposals have been suggested for reconstructing this obscure verse, which literally reads: “He has dealt corruptly with him not his children their blemish.” (For proposed solutions, see Jeffrey Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, p. 301.) The language in this verse reviles Israel by describing the people as having the opposite qualities as their God.<br></br><i><b>children.</b></i> The reference to Israel as God’s children anticipates the subsequent metaphors of God as Father (see below at v. 6) and Mother (see at vv. 13, 18). Elsewhere in the Song, the people are envisioned as young eagles (v. 11), unruly animals (v. 15), and servants (v. 43).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:6"><b>Father.</b> Far fewer biblical passages (about twelve) refer to God as a father <i>(av)</i> than speak of God metaphorically as a rock (see at v. 4). Here the paternal analogy focuses on God’s role as creator (see also Malachi 2:10). Other passages speak of God as a father in order to portray God’s love and compassion (Psalm 103:13; Isaiah 63:16) or God’s disciplinary role (Proverbs 3:12). Elsewhere, the metaphor highlights the special bond between God and Israel, a relationship that brings with it often unmet expectations (see Jeremiah 3:4, 19; 31:9).<br></br>A number of texts speak of Israel metaphorically as God’s child without identifying the gender of the parent (see Exodus 4:22; Deuteronomy 1:31; Isaiah 1:2; Jeremiah 31:20; Hosea 11:1–4). Tikva Frymer-Kensky observes that in contrast to metaphors of God as shepherd, king, or master that “emphasize the great gulf in power and wisdom between humans and [the] divine,” the metaphor of God as parent in such passages “emphasizes the emotional aspect of the commitment between the partners.” She notes that metaphors of God as both father and mother (see at vv. 13, 18) express God’s “dependable love” and compassion, as well as the way God nurtures, teaches, punishes, and redeems Israel. Reflecting on how the parental analogy functions in the Song, Frymer-Kensky writes: “It offers hope for the people of Israel in the time of their greatest suffering, for it carries with it a sense of anticipatory forgiveness and the end of suffering, the promises of an eternal bond that remains unbroken even through difficult times” <i>(In the Wake of the Goddesses,</i> 1992, pp. 162–63).<br></br><i><b>created you.</b></i> This verb (from the root <i>k-n-h)</i> introduces a string of three verbs used to describe the way the divine Father begot Israel. Elsewhere, this verb is associated with the mother’s reproductive capacity. After Eve gives birth to Cain (<i>kayin</i>), she explains the significance of his name: “Both I and יהוה have made (<i>kaniti</i>) a man” (Genesis 4:1). In Psalm 139:13, the speaker describes being created (<i>kanita</i>) by God “in my mother’s womb.”</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:7"><b>your parent.</b> Heb. <i>av</i> is used literally here, referring to biological parents, but figuratively in v. 6.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="32:8–9" ref="32:8"><b></b> Tracing the relationship between God and Israel back to the “days of old,” the poem refers to when God separated the human races into distinct nations (Genesis 10, 11:1–9) and selected Israel as God’s “treasured people” (Deuteronomy 7:6).
<div class="tab-enin" ref="32:8"><b>In relation to Israel’s numbers.</b> As it stands, this verse implies that God divided all of humanity into a certain number of nations according to the number of Israelites. Many interpreters assume this means that God established 70 nations (Genesis 10) to match Jacob’s 70 offspring (Exodus 1:5). However, variant readings preserved in the Qumran (Dead Sea) Scrolls and the ancient Jewish translation into Greek (Septuagint) suggest that this phrase originally read: “in relation to the number of divine beings” (<i>b’nei elim</i> instead of <i>b’nei Yisrael).</i> In that case, the verse asserts that God allotted lesser deities (such as those mentioned in Psalm 82) to the other nations to worship but set aside Israel as God’s own people. As in Deuteronomy 4:19–20, such a reading would reflect a notion called monolatry, which refers to the allegiance to one God without denying the existence of other deities. Scholars assume that later scribes “corrected” the text (see also at v. 43) so that these words would conform to what became the monotheist standard: “I, I am the One; / There is no god beside Me” (v. 39).</div></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:10"><b>[God] found them.</b> By using this verb, the poet hints at several possible metaphors for the people Israel. What did God find in the wilderness? Hosea 9:10 employs the same verb when God reminisces: “Like grapes, in the wilderness I found Israel; like the first fig to ripen on a fig tree, I saw your ancestors.” Ezekiel imagines God finding something different when he narrates how God discovered Israel as an abandoned baby girl. According to Ezekiel 16:3–6, Israel was rejected on the day of her birth and left to die in an open field. God passed by, saw Israel wallowing in her blood, and resolved to save the baby girl: “In your blood, live!” Thus, perhaps the language in this passage evokes images of Israel as an abandoned girl or succulent fruit.<br></br><i><b>desert region.</b></i> As in this verse, several prophetic passages look back nostalgically at the journey through the wilderness following the exodus from Egypt. For example, Jeremiah speaks of the time when Israel followed God in the wilderness with the devotion of a young bride (Jeremiah 2:2–3; see also 31:2–3; Hosea 2:16–17). Such depictions differ drastically from the way other parts of the Torah depict this time period (compare, for instance, 9:7 or Numbers 16–17).<br></br><i><b>as the pupil of God’s eye.</b></i> This simile aims to illustrate how God guarded Israel in the wilderness like the blinking of the eyelid protects the vulnerable pupil. (Other translations employ an English idiom to render this expression as “the apple of His eye,” but the Hebrew text does not literally mention an apple.) Psalm 17:8 pairs this simile with an image of protection found in the following verse of the Song: “Guard me like the pupil of your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.”</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:11"><b>Like an eagle who rouses its nestlings.</b> Many interpreters explain that this simile compares the way God cared for Israel in the wilderness to the way eagles train their young to fly. They assume the verb translated here as “rouse” implies that the mother or father eagle pushes the baby bird out of the nest and then hovers near by as the young bird tries to fly, ready to catch it should the need arise. Some scholars have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that observations by ornithologists do not confirm this type of behavior and that the verb in question might mean “protects.” In that case, the simile would supplement the depiction of God’s watchful care in the prior verse.<br></br><i><b>spread wings.</b></i> Similarly, Exodus 19:4 envisions God carrying Israel “on eagles’ wings” (compare 1:31, which speaks of God carrying Israel through the wilderness as a parent). Several psalms speak of “the shadow of God’s wing” as a place of protection (see Psalms 17:8; 36:8; 57:2). Boaz blesses Ruth with the acknowledgment that she has sought to come under God’s sheltering wings (Ruth 2:12).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:13"><b>set them.</b> Or “caused them to ride,” which would continue the eagle imagery of v. 11.<br></br><i><b>To feast.</b></i> The poet introduces a new metaphor to enhance the argument that God showered Israel with the utmost kindness and generosity, which makes Israel’s subsequent defiance all the more astonishing. Carol Meyers argues that the general notion of God providing Israel with food likewise involves female divine imagery, for women prepared most of the food in ancient Israel (see the introduction to Exodus 15:22–17:16).<br></br><i><b>Nursing them.</b></i> In applying to God the Hebrew verb <i>y-n-k</i> (which can be also translated as “suckling”), the poet adds an analogy to a mother with her newborn baby, an unmistakable maternal image. Thus, in describing how God nourished and sustained Israel, the poet juxtaposes the earlier image of God as father (v. 6) with a metaphor of God as mother. Although such specific female imagery for God is not common in the Bible, we do find other examples in which maternal metaphors depict God’s love, devotion, and care for the people to whom God gave birth. For example, in Isaiah 49:15, best translated as “Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb?” the prophet’s rhetorical question reassures the people that God has not forgotten them (see also Isaiah 46:3–4 and at Numbers 11:12).<br></br>As Jeffrey Tigay observes, the verb <i>y-n-k</i> in this verse implies that “God fed Israel with virtually no effort on its part” by producing abundant food from unexpected sources: “honeycombs, found in the land’s countless caves and fissures, and oil-producing olive trees that flourish in its rocky lime-stone soils” (<i>Deuteronomy</i>, 1996, p. 305). Whereas other texts tell about God providing water from rocks (Exodus 17:6; Numbers 20:8–11), here the provisions are more lavish, thus emphasizing how God, like a mother, lovingly indulged Israel.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:14"><b>Curd…milk.</b> The foods listed in this verse represent the type of generous hospitality one would offer a special guest, as Sarah and Abraham do in Genesis 18:6–8. Jael uses these two dairy products to lure the enemy king Sisera to sleep before she kills him (Judges 5:25).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:15"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.15-18">ACCUSATION OF INSUBORDINATION AND IDOLATRY (32:15–18)<br></br>The tone of the poem changes sharply as God’s graciousness gives way to Israel’s ingratitude and worship of foreign deities.
</div><b>grew fat.</b> Four verbs in the first half of this verse emphasize how Israel became bloated and gorged in response to God’s sumptuous provisions. Moses repeatedly expresses the concern that once the people have settled in the land and “eaten their fill,” they foolishly will attribute their success to their own actions and not acknowledge God’s role in their success, which then will led them to forsake God and turn to other deities (6:10–13; 8:11–18; 11:15–16; 31:20). This sequence of events unfolds in the verses that follow.<br></br><i><b>kicked.</b></i> This verb seems to introduce a new metaphor for Israel, who is envisioned as a fat, willful animal.<br></br><i><b>who made them.</b></i> See at v. 18.<br></br><i><b>Rock of their support.</b></i> This phrase invokes the more familiar characteristics associated with the rock analogy, namely, security and salvation (see at v. 4). However, the poet uses the metaphor ironically: the people have rejected God and sought support from alien gods.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:16"><b>incensed…Vexed</b> See at v. 21.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:17"><b>demons.</b> Heb. <i>sheidim,</i> referring to protective spirits. Similar language appears in Psalm 106:37, which tells how the Israelites adopted the ways of their Canaanite neighbors and “sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons.”</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:18"><b>the Rock.</b> See at vv. 4, 15. This time, the metaphor calls attention to God as Israel’s creator.<br></br><i><b>begot you.</b></i> Heb. <i>y’lad’cha.</i> This verb can signal a comparison between God and either a mother or father (as in Proverbs 23:22). However, nearly ten times as often, this root describes the mother’s role in giving birth (as when Leah, Rachel, and their handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah give birth in Genesis 29–30). Given the ambiguity of the biological sex referred to by this verb, one also could translate this verb with a more gender-neutral locution like “gave birth to you.”<br></br><i><b>labored to bring you forth.</b></i> Whereas the previous verb in this verse (“begot”) can be used with men or, more often, with women, the parallel verb (from the root <i>h-y-l)</i> specifically applies to women. Unambiguously, the poet casts God in the role of the Mother who labored to give birth to Israel. The identical verb appears in Isaiah 51:2 when the prophet charges the people: “Look back to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who labored to bring you forth <i>(h-y-l).”</i> (This is the only reference to Sarah outside of Genesis.) Several biblical passages use this root when they compare the trembling of people facing some desperate, dire situation to the writhing of a woman in labor (Isaiah 13:8; Jeremiah 4:31; 6:24; 22:23; Micah 4:9–10; Psalm 48:7; see also Jeremiah 30:6; 49:24). Isaiah 42:14, best translated as “Like a woman in labor I will scream, I will pant and I will gasp,” dramatically transforms this simile when using it to describe the powerful way that God will bring about redemption. Reflecting on how this verb functions in <i>Shirat Haazinu</i>, Bernard Levinson observes: “That God had to suffer labor pains to bear Israel only increases the injustice of Israel’s forgetting the divine parent.” He adds that the maternal metaphors for God “provide an important alternative to the normal masculine imagery associated with God” (“Deuteronomy,” <i>Jewish Study Bible,</i> 2004, p. 442).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:19"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.19-25">PUNISHMENT PROPOSED (32:19–25)<br></br>After indicting the Israelites with forsaking their God and worshipping beings whose divinity is denied, God announces the consequences: decimation of the population, famine, and other deadly scourges. The One whose “ways are just” (v. 4) ensures that the punishment fits the crime (see at v. 21).
</div><b>sons and daughters.</b> Several prior passages in Deuteronomy recognize the possibility that either women or men might lure the people to worship what the Bible presents as foreign gods (17:2; 29:17); others emphasize the role of women in such acts (7:3–4; see also Numbers 25:1–18 and Jeremiah 7:18).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:20"><b>hide My countenance.</b> See at 31:17.<br></br><i><b>Children.</b></i> See at v. 5.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:21"><b>incensed…Vexed</b> The repetition of these two verbs in both halves of the verse emphasizes that God intends to respond to Israel’s apostasy with measure-for-measure punishment.

This image figures prominently in the Song at the Sea, the victory song that the Israelites recite after fleeing from Egypt (Exodus 15). Carol Meyers emphasizes that depicting God in masculine imagery “does not mean that the Torah’s composer(s) believed God to be a male being” (see at Exodus 14:14; 15:3); this observation also applies to the female divine imagery prominent in <i>Shirat Haazinu.</i> (For more on the warrior metaphor, see Another View.)</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:25"><b></b> The poet employs a double merism (see at vv. 1–3), setting up an opposition between female and male, and young and old, to indicate that no one will escape God’s punishing wrath. Commenting on the mention of women and men here and in v. 19, Marc Brettler writes: “The poem thus explicitly includes women within its intended audience; this fits the gender-inclusive tendency present elsewhere in Deuteronomy (for example, 31:12)” <i>(Women in Scripture,</i> 2000, p. 236).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:30"><div class="head2" id="deu_vv.26-42">PUNISHMENT RECONSIDERED (32:26–42)<br></br>Having asserted that God would be justified in penalizing the people for their transgressions, the Song now takes an unexpected turn. Expressing concern that the foreign nations whom God wielded to punish Israel will attribute their victory to their own power, not to God’s might, God resolves to defeat the enemies and deliver Israel.
</div><b>thousand…ten thousand.</b> This word pair illustrates the type of intensification often involved in poetic parallelism, with the second line heightening the language of the first. For example, much to King Saul’s chagrin, the women who come out singing and dancing to greet the victorious troops utter this same word pair, but they associate the higher number with the man who will soon become Saul’s rival: “Saul has slain his thousands; David, his tens of thousands!” (I Samuel 18:7).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:31"><b>their rock…our Rock.</b> Here and in v. 37, the poet returns to the rock metaphor, but this time as a way to ridicule those who rely on false deities. The so-called gods of the foreign nations do not exhibit the strength nor provide the refuge typically associated with the rock metaphor (see at v. 4). The meaning of the second half of the verse is uncertain.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="32:32–33" ref="32:32"><b></b> Whereas God nursed Israel on fine wine (v. 14), her enemies will drink poisonous wine and thus die like the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:39"><b>no god beside Me.</b> See at 4:35.<br></br><i><b>deal death and give life.</b></i> This verse encapsulates the seemingly contrasting facets of God’s nature, a point communicated by the Song’s diverse imagery.

Given various problems with the logic and structure of the current text, as well as alternative readings preserved in the Qumran (Dead Sea) Scrolls and the ancient Jewish translation into Greek (Septuagint), many scholars have concluded that the original version of this verse was markedly different. The first colon likely summoned the heavens, not the nations, to rejoice with God, which would mirror the poem’s introduction (v. 1). The current reference to God’s servants likely spoke of God’s children, which would recall v. 5 and the depictions of God as Father and Mother. More significantly, the first colon likely contained a parallel line that read: “Bow to [God] all divinities” (<i>elohim</i>), which would resemble the reconstructed reading of “divine beings” in v. 8. Later scribes then removed this line so that it would not conflict with what became the monotheistic norm. (For further details, see Jeffrey Tigay, <i>Deuteronomy,</i> 1996, pp. 516–18; see also at v. 8 and 6:4.)<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:44"><div class="head2a"><i>Final Instructions</i> (32:44–52)

The second (vv. 45–47) implores Israel to diligently follow the <i>torah</i> (see at 31:9), for their very existence in the land that they prepare to enter is said to hinge on their adherence to the laws and precepts preserved in the book of Deuteronomy.

As a concession, God instructed him to climb to the summit of Pisgah and survey the territory across the Jordan. This passage repeats those general instructions, but here God commands Moses to ascend “these heights of Abarim to Mount Nebo.” Shortly, 34:1 will harmonize these two traditions by stating that Moses went up “to Mount Nebo, to the summit of Pisgah.”

The images of God afflicting “the suckling as well as the aged” and firing arrows “drunk with blood” is disturbing at best. Where does this imagery come from, and how can it be reconciled with images of God as a tender caretaker?
</div><div class="tab-enin">Biblical portrayals of God as a warrior have deep roots in the traditions of the ancient Near East. As soon as warfare entered ancient Near Eastern culture (probably around 3000 <small>B.C.E.</small>), warrior gods rose to prominence throughout the region. Even a deity like Ishtar (sometimes referred to as Inanna), an ancient Mesopotamian goddess of love and fertility, took on a secondary role as a warrior. Likewise, epic poems related how Anat, the Canaanite goddess of love and war, rescues her brother Baal by killing the god Mot. According to the ancients, female and male warrior gods served as patrons to kings, who in turn carried out their warfare in the name of, and with assistance from, their patron deity. And Israel, by worshiping God as its divine ruler as well as the patron deity of its kings, affirmed that God was both willing and able to engage in bloody combat against all enemies.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses’ Song in <i>Haazinu</i> demonstrates the violence that, in an ancient context, formed part of the image of God as warrior and king: when Israel rebelled against its divine ruler, honor demanded that the people be punished. God, however, carries out Israel’s punishment by bringing foreign armies against the land—an event that could easily be interpreted as God’s defeat at the hands of a foreign monarch and his deity. Therefore, God acts “for fear of the taunts of the foe” (v. 27) and destroys the foreign army as well.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">The biblical model of divine kingship affirms God’s care, guidance, justice, and certainly God’s power. But ancient kings were also expected to demonstrate their military prowess (hence God’s title <i>Adonai Tz’vaot,</i> God of Armies). In <i>Shirat Haazinu,</i> this view of God as a warrior-king is tempered by images of the same God giving birth to and nurturing the people.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano53-2"><div class="tab-en"> <i><b>Give ear, O heavens, let me speak</b></i> (32:1). Midrash <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 306 imagines that in the future, Israel—personified as a woman—will implore God to listen to her confession of sins. She will say, “Master of the universe, I now see the places that I corrupted, and I am ashamed”; but God will reply, “I shall cause them to pass away.” She will continue, “Master of the universe, my name is linked with the <i>baalim</i> [foreign gods]”; but God will reply, “I shall cause it to pass away.” Israel will then point out that if a man divorces a woman and she marries another man, he may never remarry her (24:1–4). However, the Almighty will respond, “Have you been divorced from Me, O house of Israel?” Thus, the Rabbis interpret the moment of divine judgment as a time of repentance <i>(t’shuvah)</i> and reconciliation, in which the unfaithful Israel confesses her misdeeds and a loving God forgives her offenses and reaffirms their intimate relationship.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Like an eagle who rouses its nestlings</b></i> (32:11). In <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 314, the Rabbis expand on this biblical simile, comparing God to an eagle: “Just as the mother eagle does not enter her nest without first shaking her chicks with her wings, as she flies between one tree and another, between one bush and another, in order to rouse them so that they will be strong enough to receive her,” so also when the Holy One revealed the divine Presence in order to give the Torah to Israel, God did so “not from only one direction but from all four directions,” from Sinai, from Seir, from Mount Paran, and from Teman, to alert the people to the seriousness of the moment. Here the Sages evoke the <i>Shechinah,</i> the nurturing female aspect of the Divine, which is often described as drawing both converts and the faithful of Israel under her wings.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In this same midrashic passage, the Rabbis declare that 32:11 also alludes to other divine redemptions of Israel. In the second half of this verse, “So did [God] spread wings and take them” refers to Israel’s emancipation from slavery, recalling “how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Me” (Exodus 19:4). Similarly, the end of our verse, “Bear them along on pinions,” speaks of the future redemption when the nations “shall cradle your sons in their arms, / and carry your daughters on their shoulders” (Isaiah 49:22).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>You neglected the Rock who begot you</b></i> / <i><b>Forgot the God who labored to bring you forth</b></i> (32:18). Rabbinic interpreters were struck by the image of God—whose actions are generally described in male terms—as a woman in labor. They interpreted this verse as follows, “The Holy One…said to them, ‘You caused Me to feel like a male trying to give birth.’ If a woman about to give birth is sitting on the birth-stool, is she not anxious…? If she is in labor and giving birth for the first time, would she not be concerned…? If there are twins in her womb, would she not be uneasy…?” How much more so, “if it is a male, who does not ordinarily give birth but is trying to give birth, would not the pain be doubled and redoubled…?” Yet this is the extent to which God was prepared to labor and suffer out of love for Israel (<i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 319).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>The grapes for them are poison,</b></i> / <i><b>A bitter growth their clusters</b></i> (32:32). In <i>P’sikta D’Rav Kahana</i> 20.6, this verse figures in a long debate over the correct identification of the forbidden fruit that Eve and Adam ate in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). According to one of the Rabbis, this verse proves that the fruit was grapes, since “those clusters that Adam ate brought bitterness into the world.”

</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>through it you shall long endure</b></i> (32:47). In its interpretation of this verse, <i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 336 observes that the study of Torah yields a double reward: one enjoys the fruit in this world and prolongs one’s days in the world-to-come. The midrash goes on to teach that this concept of a twofold recompense also applies to those who honor their fathers and mothers, as well as to people who devote themselves to establishing peace. The midrashic passage concludes with a consolatory prophecy for the days to come: “All your children shall be taught by יהוה, and great shall be the happiness of your children” (Isaiah 54:13).

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano53-3"><div class="tab-en"> P<small>ARASHAT</small> H<small>AAZINU TROUBLES US</small> with its extreme, opposing images of deity. Paradoxically, God is envisioned as comforting and frightening: the eternal guardian of Israel who eventually will redeem the people, and the jealous and judgmental deity who threatens to wreak vengeance on those who violate the covenant and turn to other gods. As Moses maintains, God is the giver of life and death, who heals as well as wounds (32:39–40). Thus, in his song to the Israelites contained in this parashah, Moses includes both a solemn warning that their lives as individuals and a people rest on their observing “faithfully all of the terms of this Teaching” (v. 46) and a final message of hope that God will one day deliver them from their enemies and they will “long endure on the land” given to them by God (v. 47).
</div><div class="tab-enin">As a contemporary reader I am prompted to ask numerous questions. For instance, why, in imagining God as comforter, does Moses use the image of an unmoving, unchanging rock (32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31)? Commentators view the metaphor of the rock as a vehicle for communicating the message that God’s righteousness and loyalty to Israel never waver, or for highlighting the superior, incomparable nature of Israel’s God. However, in spite of how the metaphor is used in the context of the Song, one could just as easily argue that this metaphor imagines God as a cold, unfeeling natural object, incapable of entering into a relationship with anyone or anything.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moreover, why does Moses describe God anthropomorphically as a warrior whose “flashing blade / And…hand lays holds on judgment” (v. 41)? Where is God’s compassion for God’s people and for their enemies (who, after all, are also God’s creations)? Is it not possible to influence and protect one’s people without ruthless killing or threats of killing? Is the price of our deliverance the death of others?
</div><div class="tab-enin">Several feminists suggest that we respond to these questions by re-imagining our relationship with God. For example, in the place of God as rock or warrior, one might reclaim God as a parent who holds us in his or her arms, cares for us, and feels our pain. Some metaphors in the Song suggest such a perception, as when Moses speaks of God as a nursing mother (v. 13) who went through labor to bring forth Israel (v. 18; see also the indirectly maternal metaphor in Numbers 11:12). Jewish medieval mystics envisioned God as <i>Shechinah,</i> God’s feminine presence who went into exile with the Jewish people, weeping with them and sheltering them in her wings (see <i>Va-eira,</i> Contemporary Reflection). More recently, this image has been invoked by some Jewish feminists. Identifying <i>Shechinah</i> as “She Who Dwells Within,” Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb envisions God as a Being who connects all of life, expresses our longing for wholeness, and like the God of Deuteronomy, ultimately calls us to justice <i>(She Who Dwells Within: A Feminist Vision of a Renewed Judaism,</i> 1995, pp. 25–48).
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Some contemporary theologians have insisted that non-anthropomorphic images of God can also be images of intimacy, love, and creation. Marcia Falk, for example, draws on biblical phrases or concepts to “serve as fresh metaphors for Divinity.” She has created new images drawn from traditional Jewish sources and composed of the basic elements of Creation (earth, water, wind, and fire), such as <i>ein hachayim,</i> “well-spring or source of life,” <i>nishmat kol chai,</i> “breath of all living things,” and <i>nitzotzot hanefesh,</i> “sparks of the inner, unseen self.” Through these images, she hopes “to help construct a theology of immanence that will both affirm the sanctity of the world and shatter the idolatrous reign of the lord/God/king” (“Toward a Feminist Jewish Reconstruction of Monotheism,” 1989, pp. 53, 56).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Judith Plaskow pursues a different path. While writing frequently about the importance of new, anthropomorphic images of deity, she maintains that “the traditional image of God as place (<i>makom</i>) evokes both the presence of the world in God and the extraordinary presence of God in particular places.” She continues, “Lacking personal communal images to refer to God, we use this richly ambiguous term to point to community as a special place of God’s self-manifestation” <i>(Standing Again at Sinai,</i> 1990, p. 165).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Viewed within its historical context, the God imagery of <i>parashat Haazinu</i> is understandable, even justifiable (see Another View). But its problematic vision for our time encourages us to create new images of the Deity that make the poem’s underlying messages concerning the nature of God and the relationship between God and the Jewish people more compelling. This leads us to ask: What can we derive from <i>parashat Haazinu</i>? How else does it speak to us today? How can these images lead us to greater responsibility?
</div><div class="tab-enin">One clue may lie in the mention of Sodom and Gomorrah in v. 32. As part of the announcement of the punishment in store for Israel’s enemies, this verse states: “Ah! The vine for them is from Sodom, / From the vineyards of Gomorrah.” Through the metaphors in this verse, the Song maligns the nations as corrupt and foreshadows their fate. This calls to mind when God threatens to destroy those cities, prompting Abraham to protest: “Must not the Judge of all the earth do justly?” (Genesis 18:25). Perhaps <i>parashat Haazinu</i> can be seen as an invitation for us to act like Abraham and protest against what seems to be an indiscriminate, wholesale destruction. It is an opportunity to raise questions such as: Where is Your compassion, God, not only toward us but toward all of Your creation? Why frighten us with your threats? Will such threats make us abandon other deities or, just as likely, will they lead us to reject You? Such questions express what it means to be covenantal partners, willing to challenge God. Thus, beyond protesting against what we now deem unacceptable, this parashah can prompt us to examine who we mean by God. It also can remind us of what is required in order to create a just society and uphold a covenantal relationship.
