<div class="chap2" id="ch-14"><i>Marvelous Signs and Destructive Wonders
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> V<small>A-EIRA</small> (“I appeared”) recounts how God, with the help of Moses and Aaron, endeavors to persuade the pharaoh to release his Hebrew slaves. Here we encounter a stubborn, resistant king not willing to concede an inch of ground to the beleaguered Israelites. This parashah begins the tale—continued in the two subsequent Torah portions—of how a reluctant, underdog prophet triumphs over a recalcitrant tyrant. The suspense-filled drama of the liberation from servitude is central to the Bible and to Judaism. This story is recalled with gratitude through the Passover seder, daily prayers, and identification with the oppressed. The exodus from Egypt has inspired resistance movements throughout the ages, as the downtrodden of many lands and faiths have invoked the potent phrase of self-determination: “Let my people go!”
</div><div class="tab-en1">The divine acts recounted in this parashah are commonly called “plagues,” yet this term is used only rarely in the exodus narrative (see at 9:14). Instead, words like “signs” <i>(otot),</i> “marvels” <i>(moftim</i>), and “wonders” <i>(nifle’ot)</i> describe the events that devastate the land and attack the routine affairs of ordinary Egyptians. We read about the first seven signs in this parashah: bloody water, frogs, lice, swarms of insects, pestilence, boils, and hail. These episodes are intended to engender a specific kind of knowledge, teaching the Israelites that “I, יהוה, am your God” (6:7) and the Egyptian king “that there is none like יהוה” (8:6) and that “I יהוה am in the midst of the land” (8:18; see also 7:17; 9:14, 29).
</div><div class="tab-en1">Women figure far less prominently in this Torah portion than in the previous parashah, yet the genealogy in 6:14–24 preserves the memory of four women: Moses’ mother, Jochebed; Simeon’s unnamed Canaanite wife; and two priestly wives, Elisheba and Putiel’s daughter. The political clash that unfolds in <i>parashat Va-eira</i> is more destructive than the non-confrontational, non-violent resistance of the women in <i>parashat Sh’mot.</i> The events in this portion remind us that the movement of a people from slavery to liberation has wide-reaching consequences.

The prior parashah ended with the Israelite overseers’ condemnation of Moses and Aaron, and with Moses wondering why God had dispatched him. In response, God now reiterates the terms of the covenant and reassures Moses that he is God’s chosen representative.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_6.2-9" ref="6:2">REVELATION OF GOD’S NAME AND REAFFIRMATION OF THE COVENANT (6:2–9)<div class="tab-en1">The name revealed to Moses is offered as proof of God’s manifest presence. Moses initially asked for such evidence in order to assure the people that the Deity known to their ancestors had recognized their suffering (3:13). However, the desire to know God’s name also can be seen as a gesture toward establishing a relationship. As the first piece of information we often give others about ourselves, a name enables interaction and serves as a substitute when we are not physically present, thus allowing for invocation and an extension of immanence.
</div></div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:2"><b>“I am יהוה.”</b> The name revealed by God, with all its iconic power, is something of an enigma. On the history both of the pronunciation of this name and of its treatment in translations, see at 3:15.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:3"><b>“El Shaddai.”</b> This complex title shares a root with the Akkadian word for mountain <i>(shadu)</i> and intersects with the Hebrew root <i>sh-d-d,</i> “to be powerful.” Since <i>shad</i> also means “breast” in biblical Hebrew, some scholars have suggested that this divine name expresses the fertile, life-giving aspect of God. There is some evidence for this connotation in the book of Ruth, where Naomi invokes a shortened version of this name, Shaddai, when she refers to the Deity who claimed the lives of her husband and sons (Ruth 1:20–21; see also Genesis 17:1; 35:11). As the plot reveals, God also restores Naomi’s fertility by providing her with an heir whom she is said to nurse (Ruth 4:16).<br></br>Historically speaking, El was the name of the chief god of the early Canaanite pantheon, and the Israelite forebears—who were largely Canaanite—would have worshipped El. Other divine names with El preserved in the ancestral stories include El Elyon (in our translation, “God Most High”; Genesis 14:18–22), El Ro’i (16:13), El-Elohei-Yisrael (33:20), and El Beth El (“El of Beth El,” 35:7).<br></br><b>“but I did not make Myself known to them by My name יהוה.”</b> The book of Genesis does in fact portray the ancestors as using this divine personal name (as in 14:22, 15:2, 16:5), yet here God claims that the name יהוה was unknown to them.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:7"><b>“I will take you to be My people, and I will be your God.”</b> The covenantal language used in this verse indicates that God and Israel are entering into a binding relationship. This contractual, formulaic language also reflects the way marriage is spoken of in the Bible: God “takes” Israel the way that a man “takes” a wife. (On marriage in the Bible, see <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Another View.) There is a reciprocal devotion in this relationship: as God takes Israel, God becomes Israel’s sole deity.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:9"><b>they would not listen to Moses.</b> The Israelites responded positively to their first encounter with Moses and Aaron, convinced that God had taken note of their plight (4:29–31). But since the first confrontation between Moses and Pharaoh resulted in more oppressive labor demands (5:6–23), the people’s exhaustion and despondence prevent them from believing in the promise of redemption.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_6.10-13" ref="6:10">PROPHETIC DOUBTS (6:10–13)<br></br>Moses has a herculean task on his hands. His own people reject him, and his request of Pharaoh is rebuffed. In this scene, Moses appears as the hesitant actor pushed onto the stage of history under God’s reassuring direction.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="6:12" ref="6:12"><b>6:12. “who gets tongue-tied.”</b> In response to his being sent again to speak before Pharaoh, Moses claims to be literally “uncircumcised of lips” (the same protest he will raise in v. 30). His words echo the assertion at the burning bush that he is, literally “heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue” (4:10). While some commentators conclude that Moses claims to have some sort of speech impediment, others interpret these expressions to mean that Moses feels he is unworthy of transmitting the divine word.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:13"><b>both Moses and Aaron.</b> In response to Moses’ hesitation, God includes his brother Aaron—but not his sister Miriam—in the revelation. The Torah first mentioned Miriam (but not by name) at 2:4; see the comment there. Although she does not join her brothers during any of the revelatory moments in the Exodus narrative, she is referred to as a “prophet” (15:20), a title only metaphorically associated with Aaron (7:1). God speaks directly to all three siblings in Numbers 12:4–6.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_6.14-25" ref="6:14">GENEALOGY LISTING FOUR WIVES (6:14–25)<br></br>The challenge presented by the Torah’s genealogies for the female reader is the frequent omission of women’s names. This genealogy stands out because it mentions four women. Carol Meyers claims that including Aaron’s mother, wife, and daughter-in-law in this passage draws attention to Aaron and contributes to an aristocratic claim for the Aaronide priesthood (<i>Exodus</i>, 2005, p. 69).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:15"><b>son of a Canaanite woman.</b> This unnamed mother gives birth to Saul, a Canaanite-Israelite half-breed who bears the same name as the future king of Israel; see at Genesis 46:10. Individuals of mixed origins trouble the juxtaposition of Israel and the other nations since they fall between ethnic categories. Nonetheless, it appears that some offspring of Israelite fathers and non-Israelite women assume positions of stature, as in the cases of Perez (son of Judah and Tamar; see Genesis 38; Ruth 4:11–22) and Phinehas (see v. 25). See also <i>Mikeitz,</i> Another Contemporary Reflection.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:20"><b>Jochebed.</b> Moses’ mother is the first person recorded in the Bible with a name containing elements of the tetragrammaton (see at 3:15), for her name means “Yo/Yah is glorified” (the first part of the name is a shortened form of יהוה). Her name thus gives weight to the tradition that identifies Moses as the first to know God’s personal name (see 6:2). Jochebed is identified as her husband’s aunt (the sister of Amram’s father); note that Leviticus 18:12 and 20:19 ban marriages between family members so closely related.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:23"><b>Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon.</b> The name of Aaron’s wife may mean “My God is seven,” alluding to the wholeness and perfection of the number seven that is evident in the story of Creation (Genesis 1) and the institution of the Jubilee (Leviticus 25). Alternatively, the name can be understood as “God of the oath,” suggesting the promissory bond between God and her lineage. The names of Elisheba’s father and brother indicate that she is from the tribe of Judah; her brother would become a distant ancestor of King David (see Numbers 2:3; Ruth 4:20–22).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="6:25"><b>one of Putiel’s daughters.</b> The lineage of Eleazar’s wife and Phinehas’s mother is provided, yet not her name or her sisters’ names. Putiel is a distinctly Egyptian name and is never otherwise mentioned in the Bible. If Putiel was an Egyptian, then this suggests that his grandson, the zealot priest Phinehas, was of mixed background (see Numbers 25:1–13). Note, however, Deuteronomy 23:8–9 considers the grandchildren of an Egyptian to be legitimate Israelites.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_6.26-7.7" ref="6:26">REITERATION OF THE PROPHETIC MISSION (6:26–7:7)<br></br>The narrative resumes its focus on Aaron and Moses, as the major themes of Moses’ commission are revisited. This section returns to various themes in 6:2–12, such as the declaration of the divine name (6:2, 29; 7:5), promise of deliverance from Egypt (6:6; 7:5), and the issue of Moses’ “uncircumcised lips” (6:12, 30).</div><div class="tab-en1" id="e7-1" ref="7:1"><b>“I place you in the role of God to Pharaoh.”</b> This astonishing analogy promotes Moses to the role of the Deity, lording over Pharaoh—who in Egyptian society was considered divine.</div><div class="tab-en1" id="e7-5" ref="7:3"><b>“But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart.”</b> This aspect of the Exodus raises questions of theodicy. On one level, the obstacle of a hardened monarch and the ensuing portrait of Egypt’s destruction seem unjust. Could God not have softened Pharaoh’s heart and spared Egypt? The exodus narrative justifies the freedom won at the expense of the oppressors’ devastation not as retribution, but as a means of impressing knowledge of divine power on Israel and Egypt alike. Pharaoh’s opposition entails a clash of wills as well as a contest between the pantheon of Egypt and the lone God of Israel. Biblical narrative renders the victor indisputable and the powers of the Egyptian gods obsolete. The number ten is at work in this part of the plot: ten times God hardens Pharaoh’s heart (4:21; 7:3; 9:12; 10:1, 20, 27; 11:10; 14:4, 8, 17); and another ten times Pharaoh is described as naturally resistant due to his own obstinacy (7:13, 14, 22; 8:11, 15, 28; 9:7, 34, 35; 13:15). (See also Another View; and <i>Bo,</i> Contemporary Reflection.)<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="head" ref="7:8"><i>Moses and God versus Pharaoh</i></div><div class="head1" ref="7:8">SEVEN SIGNS AND MARVELS (7:8–9:35)<div class="tab-en">Is there any logic behind the arrangement of the so-called ten plagues? Interpreters have indeed observed different types of organizing principles in this artfully crafted narrative. The events can be seen as a sequence of five pairs: two Nile transformations, two infestations of insects, two epidemics, two crop destructions, two conjurings of darkness and death. The narrative can also be divided into three triads topped by a climactic final plague: the 1st, 4th, and 7th signs begin with Moses “standing before” Pharaoh in the morning; the 2nd, 5th, and 8th start with Moses “coming before” Pharaoh; and the 3rd, 6th, and 9th are unleashed without warning. One line of rabbinic interpretation divides the signs according to the instigating agent: Aaron brings about the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd signs; Moses brings about the 7th, 8th, and 9th; God causes the 4th, 5th, and 10th; and the 6th is created by a collaboration of Aaron, Moses, and God (<i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 9.10; 20.1).
</div><div class="tab-en1">While the account in the book of Exodus enumerates ten separate episodes, two other accounts in Psalms 78:42–51 and 105:28–36 each list seven; and in those two poetic accounts, the signs are arranged in a different order than in the Torah. Interestingly, the designation “Ten Plagues” (<i>eser makkot</i>) is not found in the Bible; it is a later, rabbinic appellation. In fact, most of these divine acts are called “signs,” not “plagues,” thus highlighting that they were not considered punitive, but rather the means to convince Pharaoh, the Israelites, and the reader of God’s might (see also at 9:14 and 11:1).
</div><div class="tab-en1">In straining to place the Exodus in an indisputably historical context—rather than a literary or religious one—some scholars have proposed naturalistic explanations of these events. For instance, the claim has been made that the Nile appeared red due to red sediment caused by uncommonly heavy rainfalls; this unusual flooding then disturbed the ecosystem of the Nile and caused a chain of events, including the invasion of frogs and disease-carrying insects that made cattle ill and caused boils. However, the rhetoric of Exodus emphasizes that these are unique preternatural occurrences intended to promote awareness of divine power; they are best understood as devices that heighten the contest between God and Pharaoh and drive the plot toward the liberation of Israel.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_7.8-13" ref="7:8">PROLOGUE: SNAKES AND SPELLS (7:8–13)<div class="tab-en1">Here and in several subsequent episodes, Aaron competes with the magicians of Egypt, showing how God bests Pharaoh and the Egyptian pantheon on their own terrain.
</div></div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:9"><b>“into a serpent.”</b> During his earlier vision at Sinai, Moses was instructed to deploy a similar wonder as a means of authentication before the Israelites (4:2–5). Here Aaron’s staff becomes a serpent <i>(tannin),</i> a large sea creature, as opposed to a snake in the prior episode. Since Aaron’s staff later changes into an almond branch (Numbers 17:23), some scholars have identified a connection to the ancient Near Eastern goddess Asherah, who is associated with blooming trees, rods, and serpents.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:11"><b>sages.</b> Given the plural language, women are conceivably included in this term. Historically speaking, “wise woman” was a well-known category in Egypt; and the Hebrew Bible also recognized women for their wisdom (II Samuel 14:2, 20:16; Proverbs 31:26).<br></br><i><b>sorcerers.</b></i> Again, given the plural term, women may be included: they were among Egypt’s sorcerers since pre-dynastic times; and in the Bible, the practice of magic is specifically associated with women in Exodus 22:17 (“You shall not tolerate a sorceress”) and Nahum 3:4.<br></br><i><b>magician-priests.</b></i> Unlike the preceding two Hebrew terms, this one comes directly from an Egyptian word that—in Egypt—applied only to men.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_7.14-24" ref="7:14">ONE: NILE TURNS TO BLOOD (7:14–24)<br></br>The signs (often called “plagues” in later Jewish parlance) are framed by blood: They begin with the transformation of life-giving waters into deadly aquifers, and they end with blood smudged on Israelite doorposts to deflect the macabre visit of the Angel of Death (12:23). As both source of abundance and site of Egyptian divinity, the Nile is targeted first. Various water-related terms (such as rivers, canals, and ponds in v. 19) permeate this section, introducing a theme that will climax with the splitting of the Sea of Reeds.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:15"><b>“at the edge of the Nile.”</b> The spilling of Moses’ blood was avoided when Pharaoh’s daughter drew him from the Nile (2:5–10); now Moses faces another member of the Egyptian royal family on the banks of the river.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:16"><b>“God of the Hebrews.”</b> In the Bible, the Israelites tend to be called Hebrews (<i>ivrim</i>) by speakers outside of the group (Genesis 39:14; 41:12; Exodus 1:16, 19; 2:6) or when an Israelite speaks to an outsider (Genesis 14:13; Exodus 2:7; Jonah 1:9).<br></br><i><b>“Let My people go.”</b></i> This resounding phrase first appeared in Exodus 5:1 (compare 4:23). God repeats it five more times in giving instructions to Moses (here; 7:26; 8:16; 9:1, 13), while Moses repeats it once more to Pharaoh (10:3)—a total of seven times.<br></br><i><b>“that they may worship Me.”</b></i> The request for freedom from slavery is linked to the request for freedom to serve God. Linguistically speaking, the contrast could not be more pointed: the Hebrew narrative employs the same verb (<i>avod)</i> for the two counterposed activities: “work as a slave” to Pharaoh, and “worship” God.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:20"><b>all the water in the Nile was turned into blood.</b> This sign conveys a sense of measure-for-measure justice: the bloody river recalls the blood of Israelite infants spilled in the Nile (1:22).<br></br>A similar event is brought about by the goddess Inanna, “Queen of Heaven,” in the Sumerian myth “Inanna and the Gardener”: as a punishment, the goddess transforms all well water into blood.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:24"><b>the Egyptians had to dig round about the Nile for drinking water.</b> Elsewhere the Bible portrays the hauling of water (for drinking and general use) as a woman’s activity (Genesis 24:11; I Samuel 9:11). If this were also the case in Egypt, then one can imagine the particularly hard burden that this sign placed on Egyptian women.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_7.25-8.11" ref="7:25">TWO: EGYPT SWARMS WITH FROGS (7:25–8:11)<br></br>In the course of the second sign, a creature that dwells mostly in water emerges to take over the human realm. This species invasion signals that the realms of creation—water, earth, and air—have been breached. The multiplication of frogs, like the appearance of the blood, conveys a sense of measure-for-measure justice: the “swarming” frogs (7:28) invoke Pharaoh’s fear of the multiplying, “swarming” population of Israelites (1:7). In ancient Egypt, human reproduction was associated with Heqt, the frog goddess of childbirth who protected the mother and newborn infant. Other deities associated with fertility and childbirth include Bes (the hippo goddess) and Taweret (the female crocodile goddess).</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="7:26"><b>“Let My people go that they may worship Me.”</b> Moses does not ask Pharaoh to liberate the Israelites permanently. Instead, following God’s plan, Moses requests that the Israelites be allowed a brief leave so they can take a three days’ journey to the wilderness for a sacrificial celebration (3:18; 5:1–3; 8:21–24). Ancient Egyptian documents do attest to the practice of allowing free workers time off for various reasons, including participating in religious festivals.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:4"><b>“I will let the people go to sacrifice to יהוה.”</b> For the first time, the pharaoh seems to acknowledge the existence of God.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:5"><b>“for what time shall I plead in behalf of you?”</b> In order to prove that the removal of the frogs is not incidental but rather an act of God, Moses lets Pharaoh name the time of their elimination.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:6"><b>“that you may know that there is none like our God יהוה.”</b> The signs are expressly intended to engender knowledge of God among the Egyptians and Israelites, with differing effects on each. (See also Another View.)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:10"><b>the land stank.</b> Here and in 7:21, the text emphasizes the olfactory dimension of the first two signs. Measure-for-measure justice is again at work. In 5:21 the Israelites had condemned Moses and Aaron for literally “causing our breath to be malodorous” (in our translation: “making us loathsome”), meaning that Moses’ demands have brought harsher labor requirements down on the slaves. As God proves through the signs, it is not the Israelites who stink, but rather the land of Egypt during its accelerated rate of decay.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_8.12-15" ref="8:12">THREE: DUST TURNS TO LICE (8:12–15)<br></br>During this third round, the Egyptian magician-priests drop out of the contest and—humbled—admit defeat, with a partial recognition of God’s agency. The lice infest Egyptian bodies as the frogs would have disrupted their households.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:12"><b>“Say to Aaron.”</b> In the 3rd, 6th, and 9th signs (the last in each triad), the event occurs without any warning being given to Pharaoh.</div><div class="tab-en1" orig_ref="8:14" ref="8:14"><b>8:14. magician-priests…could not.</b> Having matched the signs performed by Moses and Aaron three times (rod in 7:11–12; blood in 7:22; frogs in 8:3), the Egyptians now fail to reproduce Aaron’s actions.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:15"><b>“This is the finger of God!”</b> Throughout the Exodus narrative, reference is made to God’s outstretched hand (such as 3:20) or arm (such as 6:6) as the vehicle for punishing the Egyptians. Here, the magician-priests express their acknowledgment of God’s power though a similarly anthropomorphic image. As in other ancient Near Eastern texts, the hand of a deity is an image that signifies her or his ability to act in the world.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_8.16-28" ref="8:16">FOUR: SWARMS INVADE THE LAND (8:16–28)</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:17"><b>“if you do not let My people go.”</b> God does not secure Israel’s liberation in a non-violent manner, rather, each refusal entails a harsh consequence. Moses emphasizes the reciprocal damage that Pharaoh brings on himself and his people by using verbs that share the same root. A translation that captures the parallel is: “If you do not <i>send</i> my people, then I will <i>send</i> swarms against you.”<br></br><i><b>“swarms of insects.”</b></i> Heb. <i>arov,</i> which stems from the root meaning “to mix.” Some ancient and medieval commentators understood the word as referring to a mixture of wild beasts, while others interpreted the term as some sort of insect, perhaps a fly. The parallelism with “lice” in Psalm 105:31 supports the present translation.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:18"><b>“I will set apart the region of Goshen.”</b> God begins the process of separating the people of Israel from the Egyptian population while fulfilling the fantasy of the oppressed seeing their oppressors suffer. God wrenches Israel from Egypt in gradual stages of individuation during which Israel is free of suffering.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:19"><b>“I will make a distinction.”</b> The distinction that results from the Exodus is of two sorts: Israel becomes independent of Egypt and receives a legal code that marks it as different from other nations.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:20"> Like the frogs, the insects invade the houses of royalty and commoners alike.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:21"><b>“sacrifice to your God within the land.”</b> A clever negotiator, Pharaoh concedes to half of Israel’s request by proposing that they sacrifice to their God <i>within</i> Egypt, a compromise Moses rejects.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="8:22"><b>“what we sacrifice…is untouchable to the Egyptians.”</b> According to classical sources, ancient Egyptians sacrificed animals to gods and to the dead, but the creatures they offered were not sheep and goats like the Israelites. This may account for anathema to the Egyptians. This is a kind of “ethnic differentiation” in which the customs of one group are deeply disapproved of by another.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_9.1-7" ref="9:1">FIVE: PESTILENCE ATTACKS THE ANIMALS (9:1–7)<br></br>Like the first two signs, this episode, too, seems to involve an element of measure-for-measure justice. Since Israel is not allowed to sacrifice its animals to God in Egypt, the animals of Egypt will suffer.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_9.8-12" ref="9:8">SIX: SOOT BRINGS ABOUT BOILS (9:8–12)<br></br>With Pharaoh as their witness, Moses and Aaron throw handfuls of soot into the air; the soot becomes dust and causes boils to break out on humans and animals. In James Frazer’s typology of magic, this constitutes imitative magic, for the properties of one object (soot that has been <i>burnt</i>) resemble another (a <i>burning</i> rash on the skin) to the point of actual inflammation.<br></br>When stricken by boils, Job sits in ash and scratches himself with a potsherd (Job 2:7–8). This image conveys the misery of the affliction that, like the lice before it, affects the flesh of both humans and animals.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="9:8"><b>“soot from the kiln.”</b> The reason for this specification is not clear. Umberto Cassuto suggests that the kiln in view is one where bricks are forged; since the making and laying of bricks are the very labors forced on the Israelites, both symmetry and “poetic justice” would then be evident in this divine act (<i>Exodus</i>, 1967, p. 113). Arguing against that interpretation is the fact that in ancient Egypt, bricks were generally sun-dried rather than kiln-fired.</div><div class="tab-en1" ref="9:10"><b>Moses threw it.</b> Although both Aaron and Moses are instructed to take handfuls of soot, only Moses actually throws the soot into the sky. Aaron’s role is fading, as Moses takes center stage along with God and Pharaoh.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_9.13-35" ref="9:13">SEVEN: HAIL RAINS DOWN DESTRUCTION (9:13–35)<br></br>This plague comes with an additional test of Pharaoh: he is forewarned that if he wants to preserve his remaining servants and livestock, then he will need to shelter them before the hail strikes.

Earlier, Moses had anticipated that the Israelites would pose a similar question: “When I come to the Israelites…and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?” (3:13). Divine self-revelation in <i>parashat Va-eira</i> answers these questions in two ways.
</div><div class="tab-en1">First, God declares: “I am יהוה; I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as El Shaddai, but I did not make Myself known to them by My name יהוה” (6:2). This personal divine name validates the promises made to the ancestors in Genesis. It also evokes God’s eternal nature (see at 3:14, 15). Moreover, introducing a new divine name signals a new beginning for Israel, as God prepares to bring them from slavery to freedom.
</div><div class="tab-en1">A second aspect of God becomes manifest in overpowering Pharaoh with the so-called plagues and even in controlling Pharaoh’s heart. The text makes it clear that the signs and wonders are part of God’s design—the means to demonstrate God’s control of history. Had there only been one or two, they might have been dismissed as a chance occurrence. However, Israel’s God is able both to inflict multiple signs and to withdraw them at a designated time.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Given the high status of Pharaoh as god in Egyptian culture, it is especially significant that Israel’s God can also control and manipulate Pharaoh himself by hardening his heart in certain instances (4:21; 7:3; 9:12; 10:1, 20, 27; 11:10; 14:4, 8). Although hardening Pharaoh’s heart creates tension regarding Pharaoh’s culpability, it highlights God’s supreme control. God’s intentions are quite explicit: “I have spared you for this purpose: in order to show you my power, and in order that my fame may resound throughout the world” (9:16).

</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">Thus, like the revelation at the burning bush (Exodus 3) and the revelation on Mt. Sinai (Exodus 19), the ten signs become a means of divine self-disclosure. They demonstrate God’s supreme power, proving that the Creator of the universe controls even the most powerful of human rulers.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano14-2"><div class="tab-en"><i><b>Amram took to wife his father’s sister Jochebed</b></i> (6:20). While Moses’ mother is mentioned several times in the Torah, her proper name, Jochebed, is stated only twice, here and in Numbers 26:59. Here, she is simply described in the Hebrew as her husband Amram’s <i>dodah</i>, an imprecise term indicating a familial relationship. Numbers 26:59, however, makes clear that Jochebed was the daughter of Jacob’s son Levi (and that she was born to Levi in Egypt). That information has been taken into account in the translation of the present verse: Jochebed (daughter of Levi) was the aunt of her husband, Amram (grandson of Levi; Exodus 6:16, 18).
</div><div class="tab-en1">The Rabbis were uncomfortable with this marriage, since it appeared to contradict the prohibition in Leviticus 18:12 against an aunt-nephew sexual/marital relationship. One response to this dilemma was simply to point out that the relationship was pre-Sinaitic and therefore was not restricted to the law as stipulated in Leviticus (BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 57b–58b). Another rabbinic approach rested on further investigation into the meaning of the word <i>dodah.</i> According to BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 58b, Jochebed was only a “half-aunt.” She and Amram’s father were said to have shared the same father (Levi), but they were born of different (unnamed) mothers. Therefore, the marriage of Amram and Jochebed was not prohibited as it was between a man and his half-aunt.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>Aaron took to wife Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab</b></i> (6:23). The Torah mentions Elisheba only once and defines her by her familial relationships. While it is standard for a biblical woman to be identified by her father’s name, and even by her husband’s or children’s names, the mention of all of them in the same verse is unusual. The description of Elisheba is even more unusual in that she is also identified as the sister of Nahshon. <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 20.2 elaborates on these relationships by pointing to one day in Elisheba’s life, which was also an important day in the lives of all the male relatives mentioned in this verse. According to narratives found later in the Torah, it occurred exactly one year after the Exodus took place; on that day, the Tabernacle was dedicated in the wilderness, and Elisheba experienced a number of joyous events—but then a disaster transformed her happiness into mourning. The joyous incidents were that her brother-in-law (Moses) took on a mantle of leadership that is compared to royalty; her brother (Nahshon) was made chief of the tribe of Judah; her husband (Aaron) was made high priest; her grandson (Phinehas) was anointed as a military leader; and two of her sons (Nadab and Abihu) were made assistants to the high priest. The circumstance for grief concerned these two sons. According to Leviticus 10:1–2, on that same day “they offered before יהוה alien fire…and fire came forth from יהוה and consumed them; thus they died at the instance of יהוה.”
</div><div class="tab-en1">Even though Elisheba bat Amminadab is mentioned only once in the Torah, a rabbinic opinion in BT <i>Sotah</i> 11b equates her with Puah, one of the two midwives who saved the Israelite baby boys contrary to Pharaoh’s decree (Exodus 1:15–22). These two midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, are identified by some rabbinic commentators as the mother-daughter team of Jochebed and Miriam, and by other rabbinic commentators as a mother-daughter-in-law team, namely, Jochebed and Elisheba. Such conflation of several biblical personalities into one person is typical of rabbinic interpretation.
</div><div class="tab-en1"><i><b>Aaron’s son Eleazar took to wife one of Putiel’s daughters</b></i> (6:25). This verse is part of a longer priestly lineage recorded in Exodus 6. It is unusual, although not unique, in that it mentions a wife. The way that this woman is designated is also unusual, in that she is described as one of the daughters (plural) of Putiel, rather than simply a daughter (singular) of Putiel. The Rabbis derived from this plurality that <i>both</i> sides of her family may be seen as influences on her son, Phinehas (who plays a major, heroic role in events recorded in Numbers 25). They learned about her ancestors by analyzing the name of her father Putiel, since he is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and nothing else is known about him. By examining the Hebrew root of his name they deduced that he (and therefore his daughter) is descended from Jethro (Moses’ father-in-law) on one side of his family, and from Joseph on the other side (BT <i>Sotah</i> 43a).

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano14-3"><div class="tab-en">T<small>HE SIGNS AND WONDERS</small> (or “plagues”) described in <i>parashat Va-eira</i> must have been extremely frightening for both the Egyptians who suffered and the Israelites who bore witness to God’s might for the first time. Thirteenth-century Kabbalists believed that when the Children of Israel braved the agonies of slavery and the ten displays of divine might that devastated Egypt, they did not do so alone. Rather, the Israelites knew that the <i>Shechinah,</i> the pre-eminent feminine aspect of God, dwelled alongside them in Egypt. Medieval Kabbalists often portrayed the feminine <i>Shechinah</i> as a loving mother who suffers along with her children Israel in exile. She toils with her children while they are slaves in Egypt and protects them in the wilderness after they are liberated.
</div><div class="tab-en1">This association between the <i>Shechinah,</i> the supernal mother, and human mothers is given a biological dimension in the <i>Zohar,</i> the most popular work of medieval Kabbalah. The <i>Zohar</i> understands God as a power that is utterly transcendent and—at the same time—wholly immanent in our world. The Deity is comprised of the <i>Ein Sof</i> (“Without End”), which lies beyond the realm of human cognition, and ten lower <i>s’firot</i> (aspects) that emanate forth into the realm of being. Kabbalists believed that everything on earth reflects this divine realm.
</div><div class="tab-en1">The <i>Zohar</i> represents the realm of the <i>s’firot</i> in a myriad of different ways. It often compares the <i>s’firot</i> to an inverted tree or to the days of the week.
</div><div class="tab-en1">Perhaps the most popular symbol, however, is <i>gufa</i> (the body). Genesis 1:26 states that God made humans in God’s image and after God’s likeness. Kabbalists understood this verse literally. If human beings are in the form of an <i>anthropos</i> (human body), and if human beings were made in the image and likeness of God, then God must be an <i>anthropos</i> too. Human anatomy and physiology reflect this divine reality. Hence, women and men engage in sexual intercourse because two <i>s’firot—Tiferet</i> (the sixth <i>s’firah,</i> symbolically understood as the King and Groom) and <i>Shechinah</i> (the tenth <i>s’firah,</i> symbolically understood as the Queen and Bride)—desire harmony and union. Women conceive and give birth because the <i>Shechinah</i> receives the effluxes or emanative powers of the higher <i>s’firot.</i> And women have a monthly flow because the <i>Shechinah</i> menstruates when she comes under the influence of the demonic “other side” (<i>sitra achra).</i>
</div><div class="tab-en1">Medieval halachah (Jewish law) required women to separate from their husbands for twelve to fourteen days every month: the five- to seven-day period of menstruation plus another seven “clean” days. The <i>Zohar</i> traces the source of this halachah to the myth of the <i>Shechinah.</i> The <i>Zohar</i> considers Egypt to be the ultimate symbol of the <i>sitra achra.</i> When the <i>Shechinah</i> dwells with the Children of Israel in Goshen, She becomes influenced by the “other side” and begins to menstruate. Therefore she must separate from her husband, <i>Tiferet,</i> for the duration of her blood flow; as a consequence, she is exiled or banished (literally <i>niddah)</i> from the forces of the Holy. Although her flow ends as soon as the Children of Israel flee Egypt, the <i>Shechinah</i> is not ritually pure yet. In keeping with the dictates of halachah, she must separate from her husband for another seven clean days. The <i>Zohar</i> conceives of these seven “days” as seven weeks—the seven weeks of the counting of the <i>Omer</i> between Passover and Shavuot.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-en1">After forty-nine days of travel, the <i>Shechinah</i> and her children rest at the foot of Mount Sinai, where she at last undergoes the final purificatory ritual: immersion in a supernal <i>mikveh</i> (pool). Like a newly adorned bride, the ritually pure <i>Shechinah</i> meets her husband, <i>Tiferet,</i> at the crest of Mount Sinai. They engage in divine union on the eve of Shavuot. On Shavuot day, the <i>Shechinah</i> gives birth to the two tablets of the Covenant. Ever the devoted mother, the <i>Shechinah</i> gives these tablets to Moses for her children Israel (<i>Zohar</i> 3:96b).
</div><div class="tab-en1">The <i>Shechinah</i> figures prominently throughout the <i>Zohar.</i> Consequently, many Jews understand Kabbalah to be the only haven for gender equality in rabbinic Judaism. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Indeed, it would be extraordinary if it were. The <i>Zohar</i> is the product of a 13th-century worldview. Its author, Moses de León, and his circle lived in a world in which women’s physical and intellectual inferiority was believed to have been proven scientifically. It would have been inconceivable for them to develop a mythology of the <i>Shechinah</i> that defied societal norms. Hence, the <i>Shechinah</i> is most often represented as a passive vessel with “nothing of her own.” When she acts righteously, she sometimes changes gender and becomes male; when she comes under the sway of the <i>sitra achra,</i> she always remains female.
</div><div class="tab-en1">There are passages, however, that we can read as more sympathetic to feminist views. When we read the <i>Zohar</i> through the prism of history, we can differentiate between the different shades of prejudice to create a new meaning. The Kabbalistic story of the <i>Shechinah’</i>s exodus from Egypt is a case in point. There are many troubling notions in this passage—the association between menstruation and demonic possession being one of the most egregious. Nonetheless, valuable insights that can enhance our spirituality are embedded in this story. The <i>Shechinah</i> as caring mother, basing the <i>Omer</i> on a female biological function, and the notion of the giving of Torah (<i>matan Torah)</i> as a birth are notions that we can reclaim and make our own. The notion that the <i>Shechinah</i> gave birth to the Torah tablets gives an entirely new meaning to the notion of “Torah from Sinai.” Indeed, I believe that the custom of eating dairy on Shavuot can be traced to this very myth. After all, dairy foods symbolize the lactating <i>Shechinah</i> who nourishes her children Israel with the Torah.
