  (“when you take”) is the fulcrum of a larger portion of Exodus that is concerned with figuring out how God and Israel will co-exist. The parashah begins with instructions regarding census taking and the Tabernacle furnishings, moves on to the narrative of the Golden Calf, and concludes with a series of covenantal stipulations. While these units do not present a seamless narrative, they do contain a series of thematically related scenes that all negotiate the central issue catalyzed by the Sinai event: How can God and Israel maintain a relationship that takes into account the enormous disparities between the two parties—God, who is utterly holy, and Israel, a “stiffnecked” and back-sliding nation that can achieve holiness but not maintain it?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en">
  By the end of the parashah, the text has affirmed three strategies for sustaining the relationship between God and Israel:
 </div>
 <div class="list1">
  1.
  <span class="space">
  </span>
  <i>
   Tabernacle:
  </i>
  The story of the Golden Calf is situated between the instructions for the Tabernacle (
  <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
   25:1
  </a>
  –
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e30-7">
   30:10
  </a>
  ) and the description of its construction (
  <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_33.1-36.7">
   35:1
  </a>
  –
  <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#E40-38">
   40:38
  </a>
  ). This arrangement affirms that the Tabernacle, unlike the calf, is an appropriate response to the people’s needs for a physical location where they can gain access to God.
 </div>
 <div class="list1">
  2.
  <span class="space">
  </span>
  <i>
   Covenant:
  </i>
  The parashah concludes with a reiteration of the covenant, thus providing Israel with laws to help keep its conduct acceptable to God.
 </div>
 <div class="list1">
  3.
  <span class="space">
  </span>
  <i>
   Moses
  </i>
  : While the other two strategies are more permanent, Moses emerges as the most crucial mediating strategy between God and Israel, the go-between who repeatedly pleads to God on behalf of Israel. Although Moses is resoundingly human, the voices of this parashah conspire to identify Moses more and more closely with God until even his physical being is supernaturally transformed (
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#chap-fn29-4">
   34:29–35
  </a>
  ).

 </div>
 <div class="image0">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="noindent1">
  The parashah refers to women directly in only a few places. In the account of the construction of the calf, Aaron directs the men to remove the jewelry from their wives, sons, and daughters (
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
   32:2
  </a>
  ). The legal section at the end of the parashah prohibits marriages between Israelite men and indigenous Canaanite women (
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
   34:16
  </a>
  ) and includes a polemic against
  <i>
   asherim
  </i>
  (
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
   34:13
  </a>
  )—ritual objects probably related to the worship of the goddess Asherah.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <a id="page_496">
  </a>
  Nevertheless, the parashah engages two issues that are central to feminist theology and theory. In wrestling with the question of how close God can be to humanity, the text raises the issue of divine immanence and transcendence, a central concern of contemporary feminist theology (see
  <i>
   Vayak’heil,
  </i>
  <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#page_538">
   Another View
  </a>
  ). The parashah also highlights the importance of narrative perspective and point of view. The crucial events of the Exodus and construction of the calf are described differently by different characters. These tellings not only highlight the disparate experiences of the speakers but also serve to articulate multiple perspectives on the text’s central concerns.

  CENSUS (30:11–16)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Census taking, which was usually a prelude to military conscription or taxation, was considered an inherently dangerous act in the biblical world (see II Samuel 24). Its negative consequences must be pre-empted by paying a half-shekel ransom. Only the men of fighting age (twenty and older) are counted in the census and required to pay the tax, which in this case is to be used for the operation of the Tabernacle; women are not part of Israel’s military and not counted in the census. The high concentration of expiation language in this passage (note the four-fold repetition of the root
  <i>
   k-p-r
  </i>
  [atone, propitiate], translated here as “ransom” or “expiation”) underscores the text’s anxiety about the supernatural and societal dangers of the census.

  LAVER (30:17–21)

  The laver, or basin, is to be placed in the Tabernacle courtyard, between the altar for burnt offerings and the entrance to the Tabernacle itself. It is to be used by the priests to wash their hands and feet, thus ensuring that they approach the altar in a state of ritual purity. According to
  <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#chap-fn8-5">
   38:8

   Crisis: The Golden Calf Episode
  </i>
  (32:1–35)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en">
  <span class="dropcap-s">

  </span>
  he Golden Calf episode reveals the challenge of maintaining a relationship between “stiff-necked” Israel and its holy God. For the Rabbis, this incident functions as a “fall” story (akin to how the Garden of Eden story in
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_3.1-24">
   Genesis 3
  </a>
  functions for Christian and some later Jewish interpreters), meaning that this episode represents a rupture in the intimate connection between God and Israel and necessitates a more distant and mediated relationship.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The placement of this episode highlights the ironic link between the calf and the Tabernacle. In both instances, the people are invited to donate gold for the construction and do so willingly. The gold is then used to manufacture the ritual object and, upon its completion, the people offer sacrifices and celebrate. These similarities set into sharp relief the crucial difference between the Tabernacle, which is sanctioned by God, and the calf, which is condemned as a fatally inappropriate ritual object.
 </div>
 <div class="head2" id="exo_vv.1-6">
  CONSTRUCTION OF THE CALF (32:1–6)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The word
  <i>
   eigel
  </i>
  (commonly translated as “calf”) refers to a young bull or ox (see Psalm 106:19–20), both of which were symbols of power and virility and associated with the God of Israel and other gods of the ancient Near East. According to I Kings 12:25–33, King Jeroboam—the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel—erected two golden calves, one at Bethel and one at Dan. Historically, these sacred objects probably functioned like the ark and cherubim in the Jerusalem Temple: as thrones or symbols for the God of Israel who was worshipped at those shrines (see at
  <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#e25-18">
   25:17–21
  </a>
  ). However, in the biblical text, which reflects a Judean perspective and a later centralization of worship, the calves are condemned as inappropriate and idolatrous.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  This biblical polemic provides a context for the Golden Calf episode and demonstrates the complexity of the question of “idolatry.” The Bible and later rabbinic texts imagine that visual representations of God are “idols” that are worshipped as gods by their devotees. However, in most ancient and modem cases, images of gods are understood as symbols or accessories of the god, forms of mediation that help worshippers connect to the deity. Within the parashah, the calf shares many features of the Tabernacle: both are associated with the God of Israel and are constructed out of freewill offerings of the Israelites. However, the calf is condemned while the Tabernacle is legitimated. The overlap between these two forms of mediation demonstrates how complex the questions of divine mediation and religious representation are.

Note that the massacre does not suffice as punishment or atonement for the people’s transgression, for Moses still needs to beg for the people’s forgiveness and God still sends a plague as punishment (see

In the texts that refer to the sanctuary as “Tabernacle,” God’s presence is very powerful and potentially very dangerous; nevertheless, by rigorously maintaining the purity of the shrine, the Israelites can safely preserve the vital presence of God in their midst. Here, the Tent tradition—which is perhaps much older than the Tabernacle one—expresses a different perspective, one in which the stiffnecked nature of the Israelites is incompatible with the divine presence. Therefore, the Tent of Meeting stands outside the camp and only Moses and Joshua can enter it. While this view distances God further from the people, it imagines a far more direct relationship between God and Moses.

  If God drives out all the inhabitants, how can the Israelites make covenants with them? The conflict in this promise and admonition refleets a tension between two accounts of the settlement of the Promised Land in Joshua and Judges. In one version, the indigenous people are utterly displaced or destroyed; in the other, the Israelites live alongside them in the land.

  Ugaritic (northern Canaanite) texts as the consort of the high god El, and who is mentioned in the Bible in conjunction with the Canaanite god Baal. In addition, inscriptions from ancient Israel identify Asherah apparently as the companion of the God of Israel. These inscriptions, and the repeated polemics against the

  The Bible expresses a range of views about marriage between Israelites and non-Israelites, from the prohibition of all marriages between Israelites and non-Israelites, to the ban on marriages between Israelite men and indigenous women of Canaan as seen here. Such marriages are viewed as risky because the women might lure their husbands into the worship of other gods. (See also

   HE VERSE
  </small>
  in this parashah forbidding Israelite “sons” to marry non-Israelite “daughters” (
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
   34:16
  </a>
  ) has troubled many readers, both because of its negative view of outsiders and because of the way it denigrates the religious beliefs of foreign women. On each count, however, closer scrutiny provides a more nuanced, less problematic understanding.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The one-sided nature of this mandate—forbidding men but not women from marrying out (exogamy)— differs from other biblical texts (like
  <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#chap-fn1-4a">
   Deuteronomy 7:3
  </a>
  ) that proscribe exogamy for both women and men. Such gender-inclusive prohibitions express larger concerns for setting ethnic boundaries. Forbidding only non-Israelite
  <i>
   wives
  </i>
  may represent a different practice or tradition, one sensitive to the family dynamics of agrarian societies.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The justification for prohibiting foreign wives in
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
   Exodus 34:16
  </a>
  is that it will prevent the worship of foreign gods. This religious reason should be understood in broader terms, with foreign religion standing for the cultural patterns of another people. Endogamous marriages—in which wives shared the same culture as their husbands—perhaps better served community needs. Such brides would be well versed in the particular social customs and technologies necessary for household life, an important consideration in the precarious environment of the farming communities of the biblical period. Thus, marrying an Israelite woman was likely a strategy for survival, not an expression of cultural disdain.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In this respect, note that none of the biblical statements against intermarriage (like
  <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
   Genesis 24:3
  </a>
  or Nehemiah 13:25–27) are absolute prohibitions; they are concerned only with marrying members of local populations. After all, several prominent biblical figures—both women (such as Bathsheba and Esther) and men (such as Moses, David, and Solomon)—have foreign spouses.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  Although the religious motivation given in
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
   34:16
  </a>
  for eschewing foreign brides may represent an aversion to foreign culture more generally, it is nonetheless instructive to note that the verse depicts the religious (cultural) practices of women as being more powerful than those of their husbands. Such a view is consonant with what is known about the dynamics of Israelite households: women dominated household religious praxis and exercised considerable managerial control over household life.

  1.17;
  <i>
   Sifrei B’midbar
  </i>

  <i>

  12a); given that Bezalel—the craftsman who designed the Tabernacle and supervised its construction—was Caleb’s great-grandson (I Chronicles 2:18–20), this means that he was also Miriam’s great-grandson. In
  <i>
   Sh’mot Rabbah
  </i>
  48:3–4, the Rabbis connected
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e31-2">
   Exodus 31:2–3

  with Job 28:28, “See! Fear of Adonai is wisdom (

  )., / To shun
  <a id="page_515">
  </a>
  evil is understanding (
  <i>

  <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_1.1-22">
   Exodus 1:21
  </a>
  . Since the reward for fearing God is Torah, Jochebed gave birth to Moses, through whom the Torah was revealed. As for Miriam, because she “shunned evil” she became the great-grandmother of Bezalel, known for his “skill (

  <i>

  <i>
   [God] gave Moses, as his bride, the two tablets.
  </i>
  The feminine personification of the Torah as the bride of Israel is an ancient tradition. In

  41.5, the Rabbis declared that when God “gave the Torah to Israel, it was then as dear to them as a bride is to her spouse.”

In this world, they received special privileges on Rosh Chodesh (the new), traditionally a day on which Jewish women abstained from work.

  43.1, they likened Moses’ decision to destroy the tablets to the act of a marriage broker, sent by a king to betroth a certain woman.

  3.17 asks why the first tablets were written by God and the second set were inscribed by a human being. The reply is another analogy: This is like a king who married a woman and gladly paid for all the expenses of preparing the marriage contract. When he saw his wife behaving in an inappropriate manner with one of his servants, he was enraged and sent her away. His groomsman pled on her and explained that since she was brought up among servants, she did not know her actions were wrong. The king agreed to be reconciled with his wife, but he required the contract. Similarly, Moses beseeched God to remember that Israel had spent many years in “Egypt, the house of idolatry,” and to forgive the lapse with the Golden Calf. Although God. Although God agreed to the reconciliation, God’s ardor was now cooled and Moses was required to prepare and insert the tablets himself. (So also

 <div class="tab-enin">
  This Torah portion,
  <i>
   Ki Tisa,

  begins with Moses taking a census. God then chooses Bezalel to be the artisan of the Tabernacle. Moses climbs Mount Sinai, shrouded in mist and mystery, while the Israelites below build their golden idol. When Moses sees this, he breaks the stone tablets, grinds up the golden calf, and makes the Israelites drink it. Moses ascends the mountain a second time. When he descends, his face is so radiant that he must wear a veil.

  Moses is the master alchemist. He climbs the mountain, hides in the cleft of the

  (rock). He speaks with the philosopher’s stone face to face. He holds the two tablets of prime matter in his hands. When he grinds up the calf into a fine powder, stirs it into water, holds it up into the air, a brilliant liquid shimmering with flakes of gold, he creates a dizzyingly potent potion, a love potion, an elixir of life. A toast!

  We drink of it. Our eyes are opened to see beneath the veil.
  <i>
   Ki Tisa

  is not about frenzied idol worship, but the detailed description of a spectacular wedding feast between God and the people Israel. God-the-Lover and Moses-the-beloved take a census of who shall be invited, and they make the long guest list: 600,000 and growing. Bezalel is singled out to decorate the Tent, arrange the flowers, and adorn the feast.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Time passes, and we find ourselves in the whirl of the banquet festivity. There is dancing and singing, and in the very center, what seems to be a golden calf. But blink your eyes! It is the glittering pile of precious wedding gifts.

   v. 22

  On the summit of the mountain, within the curtain of cloud, the question of who is marrying whom is enveloped in dreamlike fog. We might even wonder if the true union taking place upon Mount Sinai is perhaps the revelatory union of heavenly
  <i>

  with earthbound
  <i>
   Shechinah
