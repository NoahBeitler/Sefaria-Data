<div class="chap2" id="ch-21"><i>Tablets, Calf, and Covenant: Mediating the Relationship with God
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>I</small> T<small>ISA</small> (“when you take”) is the fulcrum of a larger portion of Exodus that is concerned with figuring out how God and Israel will co-exist. The parashah begins with instructions regarding census taking and the Tabernacle furnishings, moves on to the narrative of the Golden Calf, and concludes with a series of covenantal stipulations. While these units do not present a seamless narrative, they do contain a series of thematically related scenes that all negotiate the central issue catalyzed by the Sinai event: How can God and Israel maintain a relationship that takes into account the enormous disparities between the two parties—God, who is utterly holy, and Israel, a “stiffnecked” and back-sliding nation that can achieve holiness but not maintain it?
</div><div class="tab-en">By the end of the parashah, the text has affirmed three strategies for sustaining the relationship between God and Israel:
</div><div class="list1">1.<i>Tabernacle:</i> The story of the Golden Calf is situated between the instructions for the Tabernacle (25:1–30:10) and the description of its construction (35:1–40:38). This arrangement affirms that the Tabernacle, unlike the calf, is an appropriate response to the people’s needs for a physical location where they can gain access to God.
</div><div class="list1">2.<i>Covenant:</i> The parashah concludes with a reiteration of the covenant, thus providing Israel with laws to help keep its conduct acceptable to God.
</div><div class="list1">3.<i>Moses</i>: While the other two strategies are more permanent, Moses emerges as the most crucial mediating strategy between God and Israel, the go-between who repeatedly pleads to God on behalf of Israel. Although Moses is resoundingly human, the voices of this parashah conspire to identify Moses more and more closely with God until even his physical being is supernaturally transformed (34:29–35).
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="noindent1">The parashah refers to women directly in only a few places. In the account of the construction of the calf, Aaron directs the men to remove the jewelry from their wives, sons, and daughters (32:2). The legal section at the end of the parashah prohibits marriages between Israelite men and indigenous Canaanite women (34:16) and includes a polemic against <i>asherim</i> (34:13)—ritual objects probably related to the worship of the goddess Asherah.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Nevertheless, the parashah engages two issues that are central to feminist theology and theory. In wrestling with the question of how close God can be to humanity, the text raises the issue of divine immanence and transcendence, a central concern of contemporary feminist theology (see <i>Vayak’heil,</i> Another View). The parashah also highlights the importance of narrative perspective and point of view. The crucial events of the Exodus and construction of the calf are described differently by different characters. These tellings not only highlight the disparate experiences of the speakers but also serve to articulate multiple perspectives on the text’s central concerns.

</div></div><div class="note"><div class="head2a" ref="30:11"><i>Instructions for the Tabernacle</i> (30:11–31:18)<div class="tab-en">The parashah starts with several supplemental instructions concerning the construction of the Tabernacle, an appendix to the detailed prescriptive texts in the prior two Torah portions.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_30.11-16" ref="30:11">CENSUS (30:11–16)<div class="tab-enin">Census taking, which was usually a prelude to military conscription or taxation, was considered an inherently dangerous act in the biblical world (see II Samuel 24). Its negative consequences must be pre-empted by paying a half-shekel ransom. Only the men of fighting age (twenty and older) are counted in the census and required to pay the tax, which in this case is to be used for the operation of the Tabernacle; women are not part of Israel’s military and not counted in the census. The high concentration of expiation language in this passage (note the four-fold repetition of the root <i>k-p-r</i> [atone, propitiate], translated here as “ransom” or “expiation”) underscores the text’s anxiety about the supernatural and societal dangers of the census.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_30.17-21" ref="30:17">LAVER (30:17–21)<div class="tab-enin">The laver, or basin, is to be placed in the Tabernacle courtyard, between the altar for burnt offerings and the entrance to the Tabernacle itself. It is to be used by the priests to wash their hands and feet, thus ensuring that they approach the altar in a state of ritual purity. According to 38:8, this basin was made from mirrors donated by “the women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.”
</div></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="30:20"><b>Tent of Meeting.</b> See at 33:7–11.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_30.22-33" ref="30:22">ANOINTING OIL (30:22–33)<br></br>The oil used to anoint the sacred objects and the priests is to be made of four precious spices—myrrh, cinnamon, cane, and cassia—combined with olive oil. Because the oil conveys holiness to whatever it touches, there are severe penalties for its use on profane objects and laypeople.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2" id="exo_30.34-38" ref="30:34">INCENSE (30:34–38)<br></br>The incense contains three precious spices combined with frankincense. As v. 36 indicates, the incense created a cloud of smoke that was perceived as the manifestation or sign of God’s presence. (See also at 30:7.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2" id="exo_31.1-11" ref="31:1">ARTISANS (31:1–11)<br></br>This passage identifies the artisans—Bezalel and Oholiab—who are to make the Tabernacle and its furnishings. Their tasks will include directing and supervising the involvement of other artisans, including women (see 35:25–26; 36:1–4). The passage then gives a summary list of the components of the Tabernacle.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:3"><b>divine spirit.</b> This phrase <i>(ruach elohim</i>) also appears in Genesis 1:2. Its use here strengthens the connection between the Tabernacle and the cosmos, and likewise between the creative work of God and of the artisans (see also at Exodus 40).</div><div class="head2" id="exo_31.12-17" ref="31:12">SHABBAT OBSERVANCE (31:12–17)<br></br>The Placement of the Shabbat commandment here connects the realms of holy space (the Tabernacle) and of holy time (Shabbat). A central concern of the Torah’s priestly theology is the maintenance of these holy realms.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:14"><b>person.</b> See at Leviticus 2:1.<br></br><i><b>kin.</b></i> Heb. <i>ammim</i>; see at Genesis 25:8.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="31:16"><b><i>31:16–17</i></b>.

Functionally speaking, it portrays the tablets as concrete products and extensions of God’s will.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="head2a" ref="32:1"><i>Crisis: The Golden Calf Episode</i> (32:1–35)<div class="tab-en">The Golden Calf episode reveals the challenge of maintaining a relationship between “stiff-necked” Israel and its holy God. For the Rabbis, this incident functions as a “fall” story (akin to how the Garden of Eden story in Genesis 3 functions for Christian and some later Jewish interpreters), meaning that this episode represents a rupture in the intimate connection between God and Israel and necessitates a more distant and mediated relationship.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The placement of this episode highlights the ironic link between the calf and the Tabernacle. In both instances, the people are invited to donate gold for the construction and do so willingly. The gold is then used to manufacture the ritual object and, upon its completion, the people offer sacrifices and celebrate. These similarities set into sharp relief the crucial difference between the Tabernacle, which is sanctioned by God, and the calf, which is condemned as a fatally inappropriate ritual object.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.1-6" ref="32:1">CONSTRUCTION OF THE CALF (32:1–6)<div class="tab-enin">The word <i>eigel</i> (commonly translated as “calf”) refers to a young bull or ox (see Psalm 106:19–20), both of which were symbols of power and virility and associated with the God of Israel and other gods of the ancient Near East. According to I Kings 12:25–33, King Jeroboam—the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel—erected two golden calves, one at Bethel and one at Dan. Historically, these sacred objects probably functioned like the ark and cherubim in the Jerusalem Temple: as thrones or symbols for the God of Israel who was worshipped at those shrines (see at 25:17–21). However, in the biblical text, which reflects a Judean perspective and a later centralization of worship, the calves are condemned as inappropriate and idolatrous.
</div><div class="tab-enin">This biblical polemic provides a context for the Golden Calf episode and demonstrates the complexity of the question of “idolatry.” The Bible and later rabbinic texts imagine that visual representations of God are “idols” that are worshipped as gods by their devotees. However, in most ancient and modem cases, images of gods are understood as symbols or accessories of the god, forms of mediation that help worshippers connect to the deity. Within the parashah, the calf shares many features of the Tabernacle: both are associated with the God of Israel and are constructed out of freewill offerings of the Israelites. However, the calf is condemned while the Tabernacle is legitimated. The overlap between these two forms of mediation demonstrates how complex the questions of divine mediation and religious representation are.
</div></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:1"><b>“make us a god”</b> The word <i>elohim</i> (translated here as “god”) is a plural noun (literally “gods”) that can refer to either a single deity or more than one god. The God of Israel is often called <i>elohim,</i> but with singular verb forms used with that divine name. In this verse, the noun is paired with a plural verb, which might imply that the Israelites ask Aaron to make them more than one god. Or, as this translation suggests, the plural verb is used to signal that the Israelites are demanding <i>a</i> god, rather than <i>the</i> God.<br></br><b><i>“that fellow Moses…who brought us from the land of Egypt.”</i></b> Elsewhere in the Torah, the identification of God as the agent of the Exodus is central to God’s claim to authority over Israel (as in 20:2). But here Moses is identified as the one responsible for the Exodus.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:2"><b>“take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters.”</b> Aaron directs the men to take jewelry off the members of their household under their control.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:3"><b>all the people took off.</b> This statement implicates everyone, not only the men, in the construction of the calf.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:4"><b>And they exclaimed, “This is your god…who brought you out of the land of Egypt!”</b> While the ambiguity of the word <i>elohim</i> (see at v. 1) raises the possibility that the Israelites sought to worship another deity, the phrase “who brought you out of the land of Egypt” and Aaron’s explicit mention of “יהוה” in v. 5 suggest that the people craved a visible symbol of God’s presence. Nevertheless, by attributing these words to the Israelites, the authors of the text portray the people as idolators, who identify and worship the calf <i>as</i> a god.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:5"><b><i>32:5.</i></b> Aaron’s response is complex. By constructing an altar, he facilitates the inappropriate, idolatrous understanding of the calf. Yet by declaring a “festival of יהוה,” he redirects the Israelites’ attention to the God of Israel.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:6"><b><i>32:6.</i></b> Of the three activities mentioned in this verse, sacrificial offerings and ritual feasting are part of authorized Israelite worship. However, dancing (literally “laughing”) is non-normative and perhaps signals the deviant nature of this impromptu festival.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.7-14" ref="32:7">GOD’S ANGER AND MOSES’ INTERCESSION (32:7–14)<br></br>While the Golden Calf may be defensible as a legitimate, non-idolatrous religious object from the point of view of ancient Israelite history and theology (see above), the Torah unambiguously identifies its creation as transgressive. This is clear from the fury expressed by both God and Moses.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:8"><b>“They have made themselves a molten calf.”</b> This verse deflects blame for the calf from Aaron to the people. Throughout the parashah, the degree of blame attributed to Aaron fluctuates. In vv. 2–5, Aaron is portrayed as responsible for creating the calf. Yet here and in vv. 22–24, the people are identified as the creators of the calf. Some scholars have seen this contradiction as evidence for two earlier versions of this story, one pro-Aaron and the other anti-Aaron. It is also possible to read the contradictions as a reflection of the difficulty involved in definitively identifying agency and responsibility.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:9"><b>“stiffnecked people.”</b> This epithet suggests that the calf is not a sign of Israelite fickleness, but rather of their stubbornness and their inability to adapt to the covenantal relationship with God that was established at Sinai (Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, <i>The Particulars of Rapture,</i> 2001, pp. 408–9).</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="32:11–14" ref="32:11"><b>But Moses implored.</b> Moses uses two rhetorical strategies to successfully dissuade God from destroying the people. First, he argues that God’s reputation will be sullied if God annihilates the very people that God rescued from Egypt (vv. 11–12). Then, he reminds God of the covenant with the ancestors (v. 13). The success of Moses’ intervention is underscored by the reference to Israel as God’s people in v. 14.</div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.15-29" ref="32:15">MOSES’ ANGER AT THE PEOPLE AND AARON (32:15–29)<br></br>Moses descends from the mountain with two tablets—which he furiously hurls to the ground. The detailed description of the tablets and their identification as “God’s work” (v. 16) highlight their sacrality and underscore the drama of their destruction.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:19"><b>dancing.</b> The term here for dancing <i>(m’cholot)</i> probably refers to women’s circle dancing rather than men’s leaping dances, indicating women’s participation in the transgressive acts. In all eight instances where the Bible specifies the performers of this activity, they are women (Exodus 15:20; Judges 11:34, 21:21, 23; I Samuel 18:6, 21:12; Jeremiah 31:4, 13).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:20"><b>He took the calf…and so made the Israelites drink it.</b> This punishment resembles the ordeal of the suspected adulteress in Numbers 5:11–31, in which the woman suspected of adultery is forced to swallow a potion made with ink from a ritual scroll and with dirt from the Tabernacle floor. While it is doubtful that there is a historical connection between the two cases, the similarities between these texts form the basis of midrashic comments that understand the construction of the Golden Calf to be a form of theological adultery (see further the Post-biblical Interpretations at 32:19).</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="32:22–24" ref="32:22"><b>Aaron said.</b> Aaron shifts the blame away from himself by identifying Moses’ prolonged absence as the root of the problem and limiting his involvement to the hurling of the gold into the fire (compare v. 8). Ironically, in his attempt to absolve himself, Aaron ascribes supernatural power to the calf.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:27"><b>“Each of you put sword on thigh.”</b> The violence perpetrated by the Levites—which contemporary readers may find disturbing—resonates interestingly with the violence perpetrated by their ancestor Levi following the violation of his sister Dinah (Genesis 34). There, Levi and his brother Simeon massacre the residents of Shechem. In Genesis 49:5–7, Levi is also portrayed as violent. While the earlier acts of violence are condemned, this one is praised. (See also <i>Vayikra,</i> Contemporary Reflection.)</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:29"><b>“Dedicate yourselves.”</b> Literally, “fill your hands”—a term that is usually used for the ordination of priests. According to some interpreters, this verse means that by killing their kin, the Levites consecrated themselves to God and earned God’s blessing. Others conclude the opposite: because of their actions, the Levites must dedicate themselves in atonement in order to receive God’s blessing. Note that the massacre does not suffice as punishment or atonement for the people’s transgression, for Moses still needs to beg for the people’s forgiveness and God still sends a plague as punishment (see 32:30–35).<br></br><i><b>“blood relations.”</b></i> [Literally, “his son and his brother.” Grammatically speaking, the reference is indefinite and nonspecific; hence the language does not specify social gender. The present translation presumes that the expression refers to fellow Israelite victims, women or men, to whom the Levites had felt personal devotion. —<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.30-35" ref="32:30">MOSES’ INTERCESSION AND GOD’S RESPONSE (32:30–35)<br></br>Moses again intercedes on behalf of the people, pleading with God to forgive them. In response, God grants a suspended sentence, but not complete atonement. In the context of the parashah, this “atonement” forms a stark contrast with the expiation of 30:11–16 with which the parashah began.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:31"><b>“Alas, this people.”</b> Compare the way that blame is assigned in 32:4–5, 8, 24.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="32:35"><b>Then יהוה sent a plague.</b> This verse is in tension both with the preceding one, which indicates that God will reserve punishment until a later time, and with v. 14, which reported God’s decision not to annihilate the people.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="head2a" ref="33:1"><i>Aftermath</i> (33:1–23)<div class="tab-en">This unit describes the reconciliation between God and Israel that takes in to account the lessons learned during the Golden Calf episode.

The tent described here represents an alternate tradition that differs significantly from the Tabernacle tradition that dominates Exodus 25–31 and 35–40 (see also at 27:21; <i>Vayak’heil,</i> Another View). In the texts that refer to the sanctuary as “Tabernacle,” God’s presence is very powerful and potentially very dangerous; nevertheless, by rigorously maintaining the purity of the shrine, the Israelites can safely preserve the vital presence of God in their midst. Here, the Tent tradition—which is perhaps much older than the Tabernacle one—expresses a different perspective, one in which the stiffnecked nature of the Israelites is incompatible with the divine presence. Therefore, the Tent of Meeting stands outside the camp and only Moses and Joshua can enter it. While this view distances God further from the people, it imagines a far more direct relationship between God and Moses.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:11"><b>face to face.</b> The word <i>panim</i> (face) is a key term in Exodus 33 (vv. 11, 14–16, 20, 23), appearing seven times. Here it signals a deeply intimate relationship between God and Moses.</div><div class="head2a" id="exo_vv.12-23" ref="33:12"><i>Moses</i>’ <i>Request for Revelation and God’s Response</i> (33:12–23)<br></br>This passage resumes the action from v. 6, as Moses challenges God’s refusal to accompany the people. In his continued persistence in seeking God’s support for the people (see also 32:11–13, 31–32), Moses leverages God’s acknowledged special affection for him in order to benefit the people as a whole. God agrees to once again personally lead the people.</div><div class="tab-en"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:14"><b>“I will go in the lead.”</b> Literally, “My face (<i>panai)</i> will lead.” Here and in v. 15, <i>panim</i> is used to signal a degree of divine presence.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:18"><b>“Presence.”</b> Heb. <i>kavod,</i> which refers here (as in 16:7; 24:17; 40:34–38) to a visible manifestation of God, usually in the form of cloud or fire.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:19"><b><i>33:19.</i></b> Here God offers to reveal four aspects of the divine presence: goodness, the name יהוה, grace, and compassion. These terms represent attributes of God that seem to be more abstract manifestations of the Divine than the <i>kavod</i> that Moses asked for.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:20"><b>“But you cannot see My face.”</b> Here <i>panim</i> (“face”) refers to a manifestation of the Divine that is too intense for a human to experience safely. This verse seems to contradict the earlier account of Moses’ encounters with God “face to face” in the Tent of Meeting (33:11), although that phrase may not be meant literally but rather may denote intense intimacy.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="33:23"><b>“My hand…My back…My face.”</b> Verses 21–23 present one of the most rigorously anthropomorphic representations of God in the Torah. The references to God’s face, hand, and back must be understood in literal terms. The radical anthropomorphism communicates a vision of God that is simultaneously dangerously transcendent and intimately protective: God’s body shields Moses from God’s face (<i>panim),</i> which is portrayed as so intense that viewing it would be fatal.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="head2a" ref="34:1"><i>Restoration of the Covenant</i> (34:1–35)<div class="tab-en">In the final unit of the parashah, God restores the covenant with Israel, thus affirming that reconciliation is possible, even after a dramatic violation of their relationship. Unlike in Exodus 32, when Moses descends the mountain in fury and breaks the two tablets inscribed by God, this time Moses comes down from Mount Sinai with the new tablets he wrote himself and with his face radiant with his encounter with the Divine.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="exo_vv.1-9" ref="34:1">REVELATION OF GOD’S NAME (34:1–9)<div class="tab-enin">The preparations for this divine encounter resemble the first Sinaitic revelation in Exodus 19–20, but now only Moses can set foot anywhere on the mountain. After exploring various means of divine revelation in Exodus 33, the text reverts to the revelation of the divine name as a central means of divine revelation. (On God’s name, see at 3:14 and 6:2.)

In addition, inscriptions from ancient Israel identify Asherah apparently as the companion of the God of Israel. These inscriptions, and the repeated polemics against the <i>asherim</i> in the Bible, suggest that worship of Asherah through prayers and ritual objects was once a common part of Israelite worship. The rise of strict monotheism in ancient Israel and its insistence on the legitimacy of only one God mandated Asherah’s elimination.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="34:16"><b>And when you take wives.</b> The Bible expresses a range of views about marriage between Israelites and non-Israelites, from the prohibition of all marriages between Israelites and non-Israelites, to the ban on marriages between Israelite men and indigenous women of Canaan as seen here.

On each count, however, closer scrutiny provides a more nuanced, less problematic understanding.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The one-sided nature of this mandate—forbidding men but not women from marrying out (exogamy)— differs from other biblical texts (like Deuteronomy 7:3) that proscribe exogamy for both women and men. Such gender-inclusive prohibitions express larger concerns for setting ethnic boundaries. Forbidding only non-Israelite <i>wives</i> may represent a different practice or tradition, one sensitive to the family dynamics of agrarian societies.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The justification for prohibiting foreign wives in Exodus 34:16 is that it will prevent the worship of foreign gods. This religious reason should be understood in broader terms, with foreign religion standing for the cultural patterns of another people. Endogamous marriages—in which wives shared the same culture as their husbands—perhaps better served community needs. Such brides would be well versed in the particular social customs and technologies necessary for household life, an important consideration in the precarious environment of the farming communities of the biblical period. Thus, marrying an Israelite woman was likely a strategy for survival, not an expression of cultural disdain.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In this respect, note that none of the biblical statements against intermarriage (like Genesis 24:3 or Nehemiah 13:25–27) are absolute prohibitions; they are concerned only with marrying members of local populations. After all, several prominent biblical figures—both women (such as Bathsheba and Esther) and men (such as Moses, David, and Solomon)—have foreign spouses.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Although the religious motivation given in 34:16 for eschewing foreign brides may represent an aversion to foreign culture more generally, it is nonetheless instructive to note that the verse depicts the religious (cultural) practices of women as being more powerful than those of their husbands. Such a view is consonant with what is known about the dynamics of Israelite households: women dominated household religious praxis and exercised considerable managerial control over household life.

According to rabbinic midrash, Miriam’s husband was Caleb (<i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 1.17; <i>Sifrei B’midbar</i> 78; BT <i>Sotah</i> 12a); given that Bezalel—the craftsman who designed the Tabernacle and supervised its construction—was Caleb’s great-grandson (I Chronicles 2:18–20), this means that he was also Miriam’s great-grandson. In <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 48:3–4, the Rabbis connected Exodus 31:2–3 with Job 28:28, “See! Fear of Adonai is wisdom (<i>chochmah</i>)., / To shun evil is understanding (<i>binah</i>).” They explained that “fear of Adonai” referred to Jochebed and Miriam, whom the Rabbis identified with the God-fearing midwives of Exodus 1:21. Since the reward for fearing God is Torah, Jochebed gave birth to Moses, through whom the Torah was revealed. As for Miriam, because she “shunned evil” she became the great-grandmother of Bezalel, known for his “skill (<i>chochmah),</i> ability (<i>t’vunah</i>—a noun related to <i>binah),</i> and knowledge” (31:3).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Upon finishing speaking with him…, [God] gave Moses the two tablets</b></i> (31:18). The Hebrew expression rendered here as “upon finishing” (<i>k’chaloto</i>) is almost identical to a term that means “as his bride.” (The two words differ by one vowel.) Based on that wordplay, the Rabbis sometimes understood part of this verse as: <i>[God] gave Moses, as his bride, the two tablets.</i> The feminine personification of the Torah as the bride of Israel is an ancient tradition. In <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 41.5, the Rabbis declared that when God “gave the Torah to Israel, it was then as dear to them as a bride is to her spouse.”

</div><div class="tab-enin"><b><i>all the people took off the gold rings that were in their ears</i></b> (32:2–3). According to Midrash <i>Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer 4</i>5, only the men contributed jewelry; the Israelite women refused to surrender their earrings for the forging of the Golden Calf, rejecting it as “a graven and molten image without any power.” In recognition of their faithfulness, God reward the women both in this world and the world-to-come. In this world, they received special privileges on Rosh Chodesh (the new), traditionally a day on which Jewish women abstained from work. And in the world-to-come, “women are destined to be renewed like the raw moons.” (For more on women and Rosh Chodesh, see <i>P’kudei,</i> Post-biblical Interpretations.)
</div><div class="tab-enin"><b><i>As soon as Moses came near the camp…he hurled the tablets from his hands</i></b> (32:19). Τhe Rabbis repeatedly compared Israel’s rejection of God in favor of the Golden Calf to a woman’s sexual betrayal of her fiancé or husband. In <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 43.1, they likened Moses’ decision to destroy the tablets to the act of a marriage broker, sent by a king to betroth a certain woman. While the broker was en route with the marriage document, the woman “corrupted herself with another man.” Τhe broker immediately destroyed the marriage document, saying it was better that she be judged as an unattached wanton woman than as a married woman who had been unfaithful. Similarly, Μοses destroyed the tablets, saying it was better that Israel be judged as ignorant and foolish rather than as having deliberately disobeyed the commandments forbidding idolatry that they had just received.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><b><i>And</i> יהוה <i>said to Moses: Write down these commandments</i></b> (34:27). Midrash <i>D’varim Rabbah</i> 3.17 asks why the first tablets were written by God and the second set were inscribed by a human being. The reply is another analogy: This is like a king who married a woman and gladly paid for all the expenses of preparing the marriage contract. When he saw his wife behaving in an inappropriate manner with one of his servants, he was enraged and sent her away. His groomsman pled on her and explained that since she was brought up among servants, she did not know her actions were wrong. The king agreed to be reconciled with his wife, but he required the contract. Similarly, Moses beseeched God to remember that Israel had spent many years in “Egypt, the house of idolatry,” and to forgive the lapse with the Golden Calf. Although God. Although God agreed to the reconciliation, God’s ardor was now cooled and Moses was required to prepare and insert the tablets himself. (So also <i>Sh’mot Rabbah</i> 47.2.)

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano21-3"><div class="tab-en"><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg29.jpg"/>Y<small>EARS AGO</small>, my boyfriend and I climbed the alleged Mount Sinai, with the shower of Perseus streaking the Egyptian night sky with shooting stars. At the summit, as God pulled the sun up from the fragrant desert floor, Jonathan held up a ring and proposed. It is written in <i>Pirkei Avot,</i> “Every day a voice goes forth from Sinai” (6:2). That dawn, I heard the reverberation of a sacred voice in the words, “Would you be willing to spend your life with me?”
</div><div class="tab-enin">The revelation at Mount Sinai was a wedding—an eternal, loving joining between God and Israel. The story we read is but a veil covering a radiance we must allow ourselves to know.
</div><div class="tab-enin">This Torah portion, <i>Ki Tisa,</i> begins with Moses taking a census. God then chooses Bezalel to be the artisan of the Tabernacle. Moses climbs Mount Sinai, shrouded in mist and mystery, while the Israelites below build their golden idol. When Moses sees this, he breaks the stone tablets, grinds up the golden calf, and makes the Israelites drink it. Moses ascends the mountain a second time. When he descends, his face is so radiant that he must wear a veil.
</div><div class="tab-enin">But a light <i>ruach</i> (wind) blows from the west, disturbing the mist, and we see the radiant face just beneath the veil of text.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses is the master alchemist. He climbs the mountain, hides in the cleft of the <i>tzur</i> (rock). He speaks with the philosopher’s stone face to face. He holds the two tablets of prime matter in his hands. When he grinds up the calf into a fine powder, stirs it into water, holds it up into the air, a brilliant liquid shimmering with flakes of gold, he creates a dizzyingly potent potion, a love potion, an elixir of life. A toast!
</div><div class="tab-enin">We drink of it. Our eyes are opened to see beneath the veil. <i>Ki Tisa</i> is not about frenzied idol worship, but the detailed description of a spectacular wedding feast between God and the people Israel. God-the-Lover and Moses-the-beloved take a census of who shall be invited, and they make the long guest list: 600,000 and growing. Bezalel is singled out to decorate the Tent, arrange the flowers, and adorn the feast.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Time passes, and we find ourselves in the whirl of the banquet festivity. There is dancing and singing, and in the very center, what seems to be a golden calf. But blink your eyes! It is the glittering pile of precious wedding gifts.
</div><div class="tab-enin">High on the <i>bimah</i> (platform), under a <i>chuppah</i> (wedding canopy) of cloud, God presents Moses with the marriage contract, our <i>ketubah.</i> One commentator points out that 31:18, which is translated “Upon finishing (<i>ke-challoto</i>) speaking with him…[God] gave Moses the two tablets,” could also be read, with the slight change of one vowel: “And [God] gave Moses as [God’s] bride (<i>ke-challato)…</i> the two tablets.” Moses, our symbolic bride, turns around in the <i>chuppah</i> and faces the guests. He lifts the contract for all to see—and then smashes the glass beneath his foot.

</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Now it is time for <i>yichud,</i> when husband and wife are alone together for the first time. In 33:12–23, we read excerpts from a conversation between God and Moses that sound particularly romantic: “Pray let me know Your ways, that I may know You and continue in Your favor” (v. 13). “You have truly gained My favor and I have singled you out by name” (v. 17). “Oh, let me behold Your Presence!” (v. 18). “I will make all My goodness pass before you,” (v. 19). And, at the end, God’s hand reaches out for Moses (v. 22).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Moses comes down from the mountain blushing, a crimson glow in his cheeks. Earlier, when he went into the Tent to meet our Love, he removed his veil, so only God should see his glowing face; but when he leaves the Tent, he lowers the veil.
</div><div class="tab-enin">But this is only one way to imagine this mythic wedding. Instead of seeing <i>Moses</i> (representing all the Israelites) as the bride and <i>God</i> as the groom, some commentators understand <i>Israel</i> to be the groom and <i>Torah</i> the bride. In <i>Midrash HaGadol,</i> for example, it is written:
</div><div class="block"><i>In the third month…they entered the wilderness of Sinai</i> (19:1).…[This may be compared] to a king who betrothed a woman, and set a time [for the marriage]. When the time arrived they said: “It is time for the woman to enter the <i>chuppah</i>.” Similarly, when the time arrived for the Torah to be given, they said, “It is time for the Torah to be given to Israel” (Elliot R. Wolfson, <i>Circle in the Square</i>, 1995, P. 4).
</div><div class="tab-en">Here, Torah is the bride and Israel is the groom.
</div><div class="tab-enin">On the summit of the mountain, within the curtain of cloud, the question of who is marrying whom is enveloped in dreamlike fog. We might even wonder if the true union taking place upon Mount Sinai is perhaps the revelatory union of heavenly <i>Adonai</i> with earthbound <i>Shechinah</i>: God’s masculine and feminine Presence united through Israel, in love.
</div><div class="tab-enin">When the potion wears off, the children of Israel look around them. Once again they are in the desert, long dragged-out footsteps stretching behind them. And they say one to the other, “Love is in this place, and we did not know it! What have we been doing all of this time? Where have we been? Is this the desert, or is it <i>gan eiden</i> (Garden of Eden)? Are we lost and alone, or are we this moment caught up in a fierce union with God? Are we wandering with sandals filled with dust, or are we soaring on eagles’ wings?”
</div><div class="tab-enin">We look from one to the other—and wonder what is the face beneath the face beneath the face we wear every day. Sometimes the beauty of the other is as allusive as a sunray on the water. We seek the radiant face beneath the veil.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Messy world. Angry, idolatrous world. Tired, hungry, sick, and sorry world. But if we could lift the sooty, splattered veil…we might see…
</div><div class="tab-enin">This thing between God and Israel—it is not that we are in <i>covenant.</i> It is that we are in <i>love.</i> Every day a voice comes forth from Sinai and begs your answer, “Would you be willing to spend your life with Me?” <i>Yes</i>.
