  (“holy”) stands at the physical center of the Torah, coming roughly at the midway point between
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1
  </a>
  and
  <a href="57_chapter_54.xhtml#deu_34.1-12">
   Deuteronomy 34
  </a>
  . We move into this Torah portion on the heels of a series of sexual taboos (
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18
  </a>
  ), and we will end the parashah with a parallel list of taboos (
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.1-8">
   Leviticus 20
  </a>
  ). Between these two sections, we encounter one of the most beautiful and inspiring passages in the Torah,
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   Leviticus 19
  </a>
  . This passage contains a series of seemingly disparate laws covering the gamut from ritual, criminal, and civil legislation to commandments addressing attitudes. The laws touch upon what people do in the privacy of their own homes, how they conduct their business, what they are thinking, and how they worship together. The modern distinctions between criminal, civil, and religious law have absolutely no application in this text.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The primary theme that emerges time and again in
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   Leviticus 19
  </a>
  is the preservation of holiness. “You shall be holy, for I, your God
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
   יהוה
  </span>
  , am holy.” All the commandments are set within the context that God is holy and that we ought to strive toward holiness in every aspect of our lives.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Holiness here differs radically from what we have encountered in previous Torah texts.
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   Leviticus 19
  </a>
  offers a fundamentally new vision of holiness, one that has the potential to bring women and other disenfranchised populations within Israel into the realm of holiness. No longer limited to the male, hereditary priesthood,
  <i>
   parashat K’doshim
  </i>
  democratizes access to and relationship with the Divine in a new way.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Within the particular laws of this parashah, women figure rather prominently as we hear about mothers, daughters, wives, and slaves. The tendency is to protect the rights of women in particularly vulnerable positions. We might wish for equality, and thus a complete dismantling of the practice of categorizing women only in relation to men in the biblical period. The Holiness Code (
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
   Leviticus 17–26
  </a>
  ) does not go that far; however, it is somewhat progressive given its ancient context.

  ithin the framework of holiness,
  <i>
   parashat K’doshim
  </i>
  groups together laws that, in the main, appear elsewhere in the Torah. Why do the biblical writers repeat and enumerate these particular laws at this point in Leviticus? A number of Jewish biblical scholars recently have argued that these units were written by priests who were influenced by the work of the prophet Isaiah. If this is correct, then
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
   Leviticus 17–26
  </a>
  can be read as a response by reform-minded priests (a group of anonymous writers) to an earlier group of priests whose writings are preserved in
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
   Leviticus 1–16
  </a>
  and elsewhere in the Torah. (Modern critical scholars refer to
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
   Leviticus 17–26
  </a>
  as “H,” which stands for the Holiness Code, in contrast to “P,” which stands for the earlier priestly writings.)
  <i>
   Parashat K’doshim
  </i>
  expresses, clearly and beautifully, the theological position of these presumed religious reformers.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   Parashat K’doshim
  </i>
  begins with echoes of three of the Ten Commandments, in laws that address respect for one’s parents, observance of Shabbat, and a prohibition against the worship of other gods. There may be further traces of the Decalogue elsewhere in this unit: the prohibition against murder has been likened to
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   v. 16
  </a>
  ; the commandment against adultery, to
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   v. 29
  </a>
  ; the law against stealing, to
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   v. 11
  </a>
  ; the admonition against bearing false witness, to
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   v. 11
  </a>
  or
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   v. 16
  </a>
  ; and the commandment concerning coveting, to
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   v. 18
  </a>
  . But note a significant difference in the order of the commandments: the laws in this collection start with an emphasis on the relationships between human beings (in rabbinic parlance,
  <i>
   bein adam lachavero
  </i>
  ), whereas the Decalogue begins with a focus on laws between people and God
  <i>
   (bein adam lamakom).
  </i>
  This arrangement suggests that Israel brings holiness into its communities with attention to the realm of everyday life, particularly the family.

  </i>
  The call to holiness and the identification of this deity as Israel’s God frame
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   Leviticus 19
  </a>
  , and these elements are intended to impact our understanding of our obligations in following these laws. The term
  <i>
   k’doshim
  </i>
  (holy), although familiar, is a difficult term to define. The basic word, in its varying formulations, appears fifty-nine times in the Holiness Code (
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
   Leviticus 17–26
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Our ancestors understood this notion of holiness in varying ways. The Holiness Code offers a distinct (and complex) understanding of holiness. In the book of Deuteronomy (see
  <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_7.6-11">
   7:6
  </a>
  ), all of Israel is considered holy by the fact of its covenantal relationship with God. Yet in most priestly writings (for example, in
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
   Leviticus 1–16
  </a>
  ), holiness is defined in cultic terms: the priestly writers ascribed holiness to God’s sancta (the sanctuary and its contents), to time—namely,
  <i>
   Shabbat
  </i>
  and holy days—and to the priests from the family line of Aaron. The priestly writers viewed holiness as a primary attribute of God; they believed, however, that certain people, places, and times could share the condition or status of holiness. Israel is commanded to follow God’s laws in order to maintain the boundaries between the holy and the not-holy, which thus assures God’s presence (
  <i>
   kavod
  </i>
  ) in the sanctuary. Whereas the notion of holiness in the earlier priestly writings is highly static, the Holiness Code offers a radically new view of holiness that is dynamic and constantly shifting according to our actions in the world. Holiness is also democratized; it extends beyond the priesthood and the sanctuary to the entire community and the whole Land of Israel. Anyone in Israel can strive toward the holy through right action.

  In other biblical passages that mention both of these parental roles, the father is listed before the mother (for example,

   Exodus 20:12

 <div class="head2" id="levi_vv.5-8">
  DEMOCRATIZATION OF SACRIFICE (19:5–8)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Modern critical scholars believe that most of
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
   Leviticus 1–16
  </a>
  was originally intended as a priestly manual regarding procedures for communal sanctuaries.
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   Leviticus 19:5–8
  </a>
  is an excerpt from that priestly manual, with modifications introduced for the laity. This passage conveys the message that holiness must attend to all aspects of life. By now applying the material that already appeared in
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
   Leviticus 7
  </a>
  to a wider audience, this writer communicates to the Israelites in general that they have a larger role in the complex system of sacrifice. They cannot rely completely on the priests but must themselves be invested in the rituals.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   <b>
    19:5.
    <a href="#chap-fn5-1" id="chap-fn05-1">
     offering of well-being.
    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
   Leviticus 7:11–21
  </a>
  breaks down the offering of well-being into different sub-categories. The Holiness Code writers are not concerned with expounding the details of each type of sacrifice. They are interested in the broad category of the well-being offering because it is the only holy object that a lay person may handle and even consume.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   <b>
    <a href="#chap-fn5a-1" id="chap-fn05a-1">
     be accepted on your behalf.
    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  The writers of the Holiness Code added this phrase to the earlier formulation of the well-being offering, and they apparently did so for a specific theological purpose. By its form, the Hebrew word
  <i>
   lirtzonchem
  </i>
  is ambiguous; it means both “be sure that the offering is acceptable (to God) on your behalf” and “be sure that the sacrifice is offered by you willingly and with full heart.” The usage of the plural emphasizes that the writer addresses all Israel, not just the priests. This seemingly minor addition actually demands that the entire population become invested in what had become the domain of the priests alone.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">

  </i>
  This formulaic expression (which appears frequently in the Torah) probably indicates that the offender will suffer an untimely death, not excommunication (but see at
  <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.20">
   7:20

  ).

  RIGHTS OF THE POOR (19:9–10)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  This section moves from ritual duty to the domain of economic justice. The writers of the text acknowledge the uneven distribution of wealth, and they put measures into place to ensure that these inequalities are addressed, even if only in some small measure. The rationale for the precepts is neither mercy nor pity, but rather duty and justice.
  <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_24.10-25.16">
   Deuteronomy 24:19–20
  </a>
  adds to this teaching, emphasizing that whatever falls to the ground during the reaping season cannot be picked up again in a second sweep. The book of Ruth describes the practice mandated in our passage. In Ruth 2 we find an example of women participating in this program. Ruth stands behind the reapers as they cut and gather the sheaves. Whatever they do not grab by hand is left on the ground for Ruth and others to pick up. Ruth 2 also mentions that Boaz, the property owner, orders his workers not to touch Ruth.

  ,
  <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu_12.1-16.17">

  AMBIGUOUS STATUS OF THE SLAVE WOMAN (19:20–22)

 <div class="tab-enin">
  The transition to this topic is rooted in the idea that it is problematic to mix categories. In this case, the “mixing” involves sexual relations, and the complication concerns a woman who is both a slave and an intended wife. The slave woman has been designated for a man (who is not her owner) when another man has sexual relations with her. This passage portrays the woman as an object: the man performs the sexual act upon her (on this idiom, see at
  <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
   Exodus 19:15
  </a>
  ); and the guilty party is the man who has offended both her current owner and God, to whom the offender must make amends through a ritual sacrifice. The fate of the woman is not the primary concern of the writers of this text. They do not address whether she is likely to remain a slave or to become the wife of the prospective husband. (See also
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">

  The verb
  <i>

  <i>
   et
  </i>
  or the preposition

  In
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.1">

  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   Leviticus 19
  </a>
  is a compilation of laws from various sources whose purpose was to express the specific concerns of this particular school of ancient Israel (see at
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">

  </a>
  ). If the woman in this case had not been a slave,
  <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_22.13-29">
   Deuteronomy 22:23–27
  </a>
  would have applied, prescribing the death penalty for the woman and man. But the woman here is in an ambiguous state, for she is both a slave woman and a nearly betrothed woman. As seen in v. 19, the Holiness Code writers are particularly interested in liminal states and concerned about confusion caused by overlapping categories.

  FIRST FRUITS (19:23–25)

  The Holiness Code writers believed that the community of Israel maintains holiness not only by the way it treats its members and the sancta (the sacred things), but also by the way it cares for the fruit of the land. One was not to pick fruit from new fruit-bearing trees for three years. In the fourth year, Israelites would dedicate the first fruits to God.

  </i>
  Literally, “you shall treat as foreskin its foreskin with its fruit.” As Jacob Milgrom has argued, the foreskin refers to the fruit while it is still in its bud; therefore the text commands the removal of the buds—with the incipient fruit inside—from juvenile trees during their first few years (
  <i>
   Leviticus 17–22,
  </i>
  2000, p. 1679). Thus, the term

  These verses reflect one of the central themes in the Holiness Code as a whole: the Israelite role in the maintenance and expansion of holiness. On the surface, v. 29 simply seems to prohibit the use of daughters as prostitutes. The key word in this verse is “degrade,” which should be rendered more accurately as “desecrate.” The verb
  <i>
   ch-l-l
  </i>
  is a technical term in the Holiness Code indicating a decrease in the level of holiness. The use of this verb implies that the daughter is not only a member of society, but also bears the responsibility for aspects of holiness in the community. If a father puts his daughter in a position that diminishes her holiness, that action affects the entire land negatively. This point is made even more strongly by coupling this teaching with a reminder to observe Shabbat and to keep watch over God’s holy space. To some degree, the holiness of a daughter is akin to the holiness of the sanctuary.

  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
   Exodus 28:30

  Traditional Jewish commentators have interpreted this phrase to mean that one can damage God’s reputation among the nations of the world through wrong actions. The concept is still current today in describing public acts that can bring shame upon the people Israel and its God as acts of

  However, in the context of the Holiness Code, the teaching is much more profound, for the message is that wrong human actions can actually have an impact upon that aspect of God known as
  <i>
   shem,

  name. One can increase God’s holiness through right actions, and one can diminish God’s presence in the world through wrong actions. Holiness, being pliable and malleable (see

  <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_22.13-29">
   Deuteronomy 22:22
  </a>
  specify that both the man and the woman are to be put to death. These passages focus on the man as the subject and provide no information about the woman’s complicity in the illicit sexual act. Some have argued that killing the woman makes the woman accountable for her own actions and therefore grants her a level of personhood that is absent from the text in Leviticus. It is also possible that the woman is to be put to death to avoid paternity confusion.

  Penile penetration with emission of semen defines the sexual act, so it is not surprising that there is no prohibition against female-with-female sex acts. What we today might define as sexual or erotic activity between two women was not a category of thought in the biblical mind-set. The “problem” with male-with-male sex acts apparently was that it put one man in the receptive position, thus emasculating him and confusing sex roles (see at

  he parashah concludes with a theme that appears many times in Torah: inheritance of the land. However, this passage offers an interesting and unique angle on the divine promise: if the people fail to observe the teachings of God, the land itself will spew them out. For the Holiness Code writers, the entire Land of Israel is God’s holy sanctuary. As such, all of the people throughout the land must maintain holiness and purity in order to allow for the holy community and the holy land to co-exist.

  </i>
  In contrast to the Covenant Collection in Exodus (
  <i>
   parashat Mishpatim
  </i>
  ), the Holiness Code rarely includes women explicitly. Such mention here suggests that one of the priestly writers’ concerns is with women’s accessing the divine realm. I Samuel 28 tells the story of King Saul’s consultation with the woman of En-dor, who provides him with access to the ghost of the prophet Samuel. The woman fears for her life because she knows that necromancy is banned, yet Saul has recognized that some Israelites must nevertheless be practicing it and that he needs the woman’s assistance. In a world in which only men could enter into the priesthood and in which men dominated the prophetic guilds, it is likely that women used other forms of divination to access the divine realm.

  more comprehensively than any other portion of the Torah what it means for persons and community to be holy. Dictionary definitions of the Bible’s concept of holiness emphasize the notion of separation. In
  <i>
   parashat K’doshim
  </i>
  , however, holiness comes from cultivating relationships. Connections—not only separations—define the holy community: the connection to parents whom one must honor, to the poor and the disadvantaged whom one must protect, to the neighbor and stranger whom one must love, and of course to God.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  God commands Israel to “love” three times in the Torah. One case is in the text that follows the
  <i>
   Sh’ma
  </i>
  (“You shall love your God
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
   יהוה
  </span>
  with all your heart,”
  <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_6.1-7.5">
   Deuteronomy 6:5
  </a>
  ), known as the
  <i>
   V’ahavta.
  </i>
  Our parashah mentions the other two commands: to love the one who is a member of one’s group (“Love your fellow [Israelite] as yourself,”
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.18">
   19:18
  </a>
  ); and finally, to love the stranger (
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.34">
   19:34
  </a>
  ). Loving the stranger is a unique notion in the ancient world. The verse’s rationale for loving the stranger—“for you were strangers in the land of Egypt”—has continuing ramifications that are often overlooked: the proper response to having suffered abuse is not vengeance or special entitlement, but rather sensitivity and determination to prevent such an abuse of others, including strangers. The three commandments are three dimensions of a single, deep connection: to love God is to love others, those like us and those who are not.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Ruth the Moabite stands as the exemplar of what it means to love, including loving the stranger. While still in the land of Moab, Ruth vows an undying loyalty to Naomi, Naomi’s people, and Naomi’s God (Ruth 1:16–17). After she arrives in Bethlehem, Ruth’s behavior and commitment become a model for others: Boaz acknowledges that his kindness to Ruth is prompted by her prior generosity to Naomi (2:11); and the women of the town proclaim that Naomi’s eventual reversal of fortune came about because of “your daughter-in-law, who loves you” (
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.15">
   4:15
  </a>
  ). Even without using the word
  <i>
   kadosh
  </i>
  (“holy”), the story of Ruth points to the transformation that the “love commandments” in this parashah can bring about—and to the ways that these precepts serve to sanctify life and community.

  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
   19:1
  </a>
  teaches that separating ourselves from forbidden sexual relations and transgressions is the path to holiness, “for every place (in the Torah) you find instruction to fence yourself in against such relations, you also find mention of holiness.” Nachmanides views this verse as commanding moderation in satisfying physical urges such as eating, drinking, and sexual relations.

  </i>
  The Talmud teaches that
  <i>
   l’shon hara

  <i>
   Arachin

  16b, the first part of this verse teaches that when someone has done something offensive, confrontation is essential. While many people might hesitate out of fear of stirring up conflict and resentment, Midrash
  <i>
   B’reishit Rabbah
  </i>
  54.3 urges confrontation as a way to improve understanding and increase caring. BT
  <i>
   Arachin
  </i>
  16b also suggests that the command to rebuke is doubled in order to teach us that when we do confront the offending individuals, if they do not correct their behavior we must go back and confront them again. But—the Talmud continues—we must not embarrass such persons, making sure that we “incur no guilt on their account.” Rashi advises that we avoid causing embarrassment by making sure not to confront others in public.

  ) as prohibiting male homosexual acts in general. While Rabbi Judah forbade two bachelors to sleep under the same blanket, a majority of the Rabbis of the Talmud permit it (BT
  <i>

  82a). Maimonides agreed, stating that “Jews are not suspected of engaging in homosexual relations” (
  <i>
   Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Intercourse

  22.2). This disagreement persists in later codes, with some, like the
  <i>
   Shulchan Aruch,
  </i>
  counseling against two men sleeping under the same blanket.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The Rabbis limited their reading of this verse to male homosexual acts, noting that the Torah nowhere explicitly prohibits sex between two women. However, in BT
  <i>
   Y’vamot

  76a, Rav Huna argued that women who engage in lesbian sex cannot marry priests. Rabbi Eliezer urged leniency, on the grounds that sex between women does not involve penetration and therefore is “mere indecency.”
  <i>
   Sifra, Acharei Mot
  </i>
  9.8, prohibits marriage between women as something done by the Egyptians that, based on
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
   Leviticus 18:3
  </a>
  , we must not imitate. Maimonides combined these two teachings in his
  <i>
   Mishneh Torah
  </i>
  (
  <i>
   Laws of Forbidden Intercourse
  </i>
  21.8), noting that sexual relations between
  <a id="page_718">
  </a>
  women are prohibited because they are among the “ways of the Egyptians,” but that such acts are not punished with stoning or even lashes, as there is no act of penetration and the women violate no explicit biblical prohibition. A woman who has engaged in lesbian sex would be permitted to marry or stay married, even to a priest. Still, Maimonides says that such a woman should be punished with lashes for breaking a rabbinic law, and he advises husbands not to allow their wives to spend time with women known as lesbians, to avoid their being tempted to engage in sexual relations with another woman.

  before us one of the most difficult commandments in the whole Torah—not kashrut or Shabbat, nor even the rules of sexual conduct, but rather the admonition and expectation to “be holy.” Throughout the Torah, we are given rules and statutes that tell us what to do. Here we are told what to be. We find a similar statement in
  <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
   Exodus 19:6
  </a>
  , commanding us to be a “kingdom of priests and a holy people.” But what does it mean to be holy?
  <i>
   K’doshim

  does not tell us. The guidance that the parashah gives us is in the specifics: the “who, when, why, and how” of the injunction.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  First,
  <i>
   who
  </i>
  is to be holy? The entire people is addressed:

  emphasizes the ability of any Jew to attain even the highest and noblest principles of Judaism; thus these laws, and the paradigm of “holiness,” are not only for a select few, but for everyone.

  <i>
   When
  </i>
  are we to be holy? The verb
  <i>
   tih’yu
  </i>
  in
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
   verse 2
  </a>
  can be read—and is often read—as a command (“be holy!”). But it is grammatically a future form (“you shall be holy”). The implications are: “Be holy—now! And you shall be holy—in the future.” Thus holiness is a daily struggle, in the here and now, as well as a future yearning.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   Why
  </i>
  are we to be holy? Because God is holy. The 16th-century commentator Rabbi Obadiah Sforno notes that this verse teaches us that we are to remember and act “in the image of our Creator,” as much as that is possible. Philosophers refer to this concept via the Latin term
  <i>
   imitatio dei.
  </i>
  We try and “imitate” the Divine. As God cares for the widow and orphan, so do we. As God rests on the seventh day, so do we. In imitating God we can achieve a higher sense of purpose and our actions will reflect the ongoing concern of the Divine for the world. In imitating God’s holiness we make holiness our behavioral ideal.

  In much of the Torah, it is God who sanctifies—as we read in
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 2:3
  </a>
  : “Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy.” But in
  <i>
   K’doshim,
  </i>
  the command to make things holy is addressed to humanity. The task of sanctifying our lives is placed upon us, as an act of partnership between human beings and God. This is one way that we strive to act in God’s image.

  The
  <i>
   how
  </i>
  to be holy is what follows—as the parashah lists a wide-ranging series of ethical laws, including honoring one’s parents, respecting the elderly, justice for the stranger, love of one’s fellow human, and more. But note that even though the parashah enumerates the specifics of holy behavior, it never defines what it means by the word
  <i>
   kadosh
  </i>
  (“holy”). Many commentators have tried to understand the term
  <i>
   kadosh
  </i>
  as indicating a state of being. Rashi (11th century) and Ramban (13th century) both interpret “you shall be holy” as meaning “you shall be separate.” For them, holiness requires standing apart as Jews, with a firm set of boundaries. The end of
  <i>
   K’doshim
  </i>
  underscores their point: “You shall be holy to Me, for I
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
   יהוה
  </span>
  am holy, and I have set you apart from other peoples to be Mine” (
  <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.26">
   20:26
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  This concept of separation is critical to understanding Jewish spirituality. For example, in the classic Jewish marriage formula, the phrase
  <i>
   harei at m’kudeshet li
  </i>
  means “you are set apart for me from others.” (Wedding officiants are fond of claiming that it means “you are sanctified to me,” which is a more midrashic derivation.) In the Talmud,
  <i>
   hekdesh
  </i>
  is money or goods set aside or separated for tithing or donation. Holiness seems intrinsically linked in Judaism to separation (
  <i>
   havdalah
  </i>
  ), making distinctions: milk or meat, Shabbat or weekday, Jew or gentile, female or male.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  But does this concept of spirituality ring true for women? Would there be a different kind of
  <i>
   imitatio dei
  </i>
  for women? Do women experience holiness differently? For those women who carry life inside, attached to another being who is—at the same time—part of them, separateness does not equal spirituality. For those women who breastfeed—who nurture and sustain from their very own bodies—connection is more at the root of holiness. For those women who form bonded friendships from earliest memory, or who bring the family together, who are the cohesive force in a group, a definition of holiness is needed that does not imply building fences. Thus, though
  <i>
   parashat K’doshim
  </i>
  demands holiness, it is up to us to define holiness in a way that is truthful for both women and men.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  As is apparent, then, Rashi’s definition of
  <i>
   kadosh
  </i>
  as “separate” presents a fundamental feminist challenge. The challenge is evident as well throughout rabbinic Judaism where authorities have portrayed the mitzvot as drawing lines between “us” and “them,” lines that demarcate who is
  <i>
   in
  </i>
  (for example, circumcision marking a Jewish boy) and who is
  <i>
   out
  </i>
  (for example, the halachah of not counting women in a minyan). While feminists have challenged specific mitzvot, finding a way “in” through creative rereading and even reinventing, we have not yet sufficiently challenged the very notion of mitzvot that rest upon the “spirituality of separation.” This notion is at the heart of much that Jews do—including kashrut, Shabbat, and the marriage ceremony, just to name a few. Redefining the mitzvot as connectors rather than as boundaries, as dialogue rather than as answers, is a first step toward addressing the question of how we as women will be
  <i>
   kadosh.
  </i>
  Although we are still at the beginning of exploring what a fully developed feminist notion of being holy might look like, the opening words of this parashah—
  <i>
   k’doshim tih’yu
  </i>
  —carry both a command for now and promise for the future: we can and we will find ways to be holy.
