<div class="chap2" id="ch-30"><i>A Call to Holiness</i><div class="tab-en"><br></br>P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>’DOSHIM</small> (“holy”) stands at the physical center of the Torah, coming roughly at the midway point between Genesis 1 and Deuteronomy 34. We move into this Torah portion on the heels of a series of sexual taboos (Leviticus 18), and we will end the parashah with a parallel list of taboos (Leviticus 20). Between these two sections, we encounter one of the most beautiful and inspiring passages in the Torah, Leviticus 19. This passage contains a series of seemingly disparate laws covering the gamut from ritual, criminal, and civil legislation to commandments addressing attitudes. The laws touch upon what people do in the privacy of their own homes, how they conduct their business, what they are thinking, and how they worship together. The modern distinctions between criminal, civil, and religious law have absolutely no application in this text.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>The primary theme that emerges time and again in Leviticus 19 is the preservation of holiness. “You shall be holy, for I, your God יהוה, am holy.” All the commandments are set within the context that God is holy and that we ought to strive toward holiness in every aspect of our lives.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>Holiness here differs radically from what we have encountered in previous Torah texts. Leviticus 19 offers a fundamentally new vision of holiness, one that has the potential to bring women and other disenfranchised populations within Israel into the realm of holiness. No longer limited to the male, hereditary priesthood, <i>parashat K’doshim</i> democratizes access to and relationship with the Divine in a new way.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>Within the particular laws of this parashah, women figure rather prominently as we hear about mothers, daughters, wives, and slaves. The tendency is to protect the rights of women in particularly vulnerable positions. We might wish for equality, and thus a complete dismantling of the practice of categorizing women only in relation to men in the biblical period. The Holiness Code (Leviticus 17–26) does not go that far; however, it is somewhat progressive given its ancient context.</div><div class="right1"><br></br>—<i>S.

Why do the biblical writers repeat and enumerate these particular laws at this point in Leviticus? A number of Jewish biblical scholars recently have argued that these units were written by priests who were influenced by the work of the prophet Isaiah. If this is correct, then Leviticus 17–26 can be read as a response by reform-minded priests (a group of anonymous writers) to an earlier group of priests whose writings are preserved in Leviticus 1–16 and elsewhere in the Torah. (Modern critical scholars refer to Leviticus 17–26 as “H,” which stands for the Holiness Code, in contrast to “P,” which stands for the earlier priestly writings.) <i>Parashat K’doshim</i> expresses, clearly and beautifully, the theological position of these presumed religious reformers.<br></br></div><div class="tab-enin"><i>Parashat K’doshim</i> begins with echoes of three of the Ten Commandments, in laws that address respect for one’s parents, observance of Shabbat, and a prohibition against the worship of other gods. There may be further traces of the Decalogue elsewhere in this unit: the prohibition against murder has been likened to v. 16; the commandment against adultery, to v. 29; the law against stealing, to v. 11; the admonition against bearing false witness, to v. 11 or v. 16; and the commandment concerning coveting, to v. 18. But note a significant difference in the order of the commandments: the laws in this collection start with an emphasis on the relationships between human beings (in rabbinic parlance, <i>bein adam lachavero</i>), whereas the Decalogue begins with a focus on laws between people and God <i>(bein adam lamakom).</i> This arrangement suggests that Israel brings holiness into its communities with attention to the realm of everyday life, particularly the family.<br></br></div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.1-2">THE HOLINESS FORMULA (19:1–2)<br></br></div><b>Speak to the whole Israelite community.</b> The entire community is addressed, women and men.<br></br><i><b>You shall be holy, for I…am holy.</b></i> The call to holiness and the identification of this deity as Israel’s God frame Leviticus 19, and these elements are intended to impact our understanding of our obligations in following these laws. The term <i>k’doshim</i> (holy), although familiar, is a difficult term to define. The basic word, in its varying formulations, appears fifty-nine times in the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17–26).<br></br>Our ancestors understood this notion of holiness in varying ways. The Holiness Code offers a distinct (and complex) understanding of holiness. In the book of Deuteronomy (see 7:6), all of Israel is considered holy by the fact of its covenantal relationship with God. Yet in most priestly writings (for example, in Leviticus 1–16), holiness is defined in cultic terms: the priestly writers ascribed holiness to God’s sancta (the sanctuary and its contents), to time—namely, <i>Shabbat</i> and holy days—and to the priests from the family line of Aaron. The priestly writers viewed holiness as a primary attribute of God; they believed, however, that certain people, places, and times could share the condition or status of holiness. Israel is commanded to follow God’s laws in order to maintain the boundaries between the holy and the not-holy, which thus assures God’s presence (<i>kavod</i>) in the sanctuary. Whereas the notion of holiness in the earlier priestly writings is highly static, the Holiness Code offers a radically new view of holiness that is dynamic and constantly shifting according to our actions in the world. Holiness is also democratized; it extends beyond the priesthood and the sanctuary to the entire community and the whole Land of Israel. Anyone in Israel can strive toward the holy through right action.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:3"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.3-4">ON PARENTS AND IDOLS (19:3–4)<br></br>These two verses together echo three of the Decalogue’s precepts.<br></br></div><b>your mother and your father.</b> In other biblical passages that mention both of these parental roles, the father is listed before the mother (for example, Exodus 20:12; 21:15, 17; Deuteronomy 5:16; 21:18; Proverbs 1:8; 20:20). The inverted order here gives special honor to the mother.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:4"><b>to idols or…molten gods.</b> Both <i>elilim</i> (“idols”) and <i>elohei maseichah</i> (“molten gods”) refer specifically to tangible, human-made representations of gods.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:5"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.5-8">DEMOCRATIZATION OF SACRIFICE (19:5–8)<br></br>Modern critical scholars believe that most of Leviticus 1–16 was originally intended as a priestly manual regarding procedures for communal sanctuaries. Leviticus 19:5–8 is an excerpt from that priestly manual, with modifications introduced for the laity. This passage conveys the message that holiness must attend to all aspects of life. By now applying the material that already appeared in Leviticus 7 to a wider audience, this writer communicates to the Israelites in general that they have a larger role in the complex system of sacrifice. They cannot rely completely on the priests but must themselves be invested in the rituals.<br></br></div><b>offering of well-being.</b> Leviticus 7:11–21 breaks down the offering of well-being into different sub-categories. The Holiness Code writers are not concerned with expounding the details of each type of sacrifice. They are interested in the broad category of the well-being offering because it is the only holy object that a lay person may handle and even consume.<br></br><i><b>be accepted on your behalf.</b></i> The writers of the Holiness Code added this phrase to the earlier formulation of the well-being offering, and they apparently did so for a specific theological purpose. By its form, the Hebrew word <i>lirtzonchem</i> is ambiguous; it means both “be sure that the offering is acceptable (to God) on your behalf” and “be sure that the sacrifice is offered by you willingly and with full heart.” The usage of the plural emphasizes that the writer addresses all Israel, not just the priests. This seemingly minor addition actually demands that the entire population become invested in what had become the domain of the priests alone.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:8"><b>that person shall be cut off from kin.</b> This formulaic expression (which appears frequently in the Torah) probably indicates that the offender will suffer an untimely death, not excommunication (but see at 7:20).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:10"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.9-10">RIGHTS OF THE POOR (19:9–10)<br></br>This section moves from ritual duty to the domain of economic justice. The writers of the text acknowledge the uneven distribution of wealth, and they put measures into place to ensure that these inequalities are addressed, even if only in some small measure. The rationale for the precepts is neither mercy nor pity, but rather duty and justice. Deuteronomy 24:19–20 adds to this teaching, emphasizing that whatever falls to the ground during the reaping season cannot be picked up again in a second sweep. The book of Ruth describes the practice mandated in our passage. In Ruth 2 we find an example of women participating in this program. Ruth stands behind the reapers as they cut and gather the sheaves. Whatever they do not grab by hand is left on the ground for Ruth and others to pick up. Ruth 2 also mentions that Boaz, the property owner, orders his workers not to touch Ruth.<br></br></div><b>pick…bare.</b> Although the meaning of the Hebrew verb <i>t’olel</i> is not entirely clear, the sense is that some grapes were to be left on the vine, in parallel to leaving a furrow of the field for the poor to harvest. In both cases, the poor were to have the opportunity to pick what had been dropped or left by regular workers.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:11"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.11-16">THEFT, DECEIT, AND FAIR COURTS OF LAW (19:11–16)<br></br>This collection of laws addresses potential opportunities for exploitation between neighbors and within courts of law. Justice is the central theme, whether the justice is to be carried out in courts of law or only in the eyes of God.<br></br></div><b>steal.</b> Heb. <i>ganav,</i> a term that refers to kidnapping and not only to theft of property. There are only two cases in the Bible of women stealing: the matriarch Rachel stealing her father’s <i>t’rafim</i> (the household religious figurines) when she leaves her father’s household (see at Genesis 31:19), and the princess Jehoshabeath, who steals away the young prince Joash to protect him from a military coup and slaughter (II Chronicles 22:11; she is named Jehosheba in II Kings 11:2). In both cases, the act of theft is motivated by a desire to protect the continuity of the family line.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:14"><b>insult.</b> Literally, “utter a curse.” Just as the blind cannot see a physical obstacle in their path, so the deaf cannot hear a curse and take precautions against it.<br></br><i><b>You shall fear your God.</b></i> This phrase serves as a warning against haughtiness, reminding each individual that there is a force far beyond one’s understanding. Proper perspective helps persons to treat others with compassion.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:16"><b>basely.</b> The corresponding Hebrew word is also associated with gossip, the misuse of speech. In this particular context, the Torah teaches that unfair accusations and rumors may have dire consequences. (Nowhere does the Bible explicitly associate women with gossip. It is only in rabbinic literature that gossip, <i>l’shon hara,</i> comes to be connected with women, through a midrash on Numbers 12 and Miriam.)<br></br><i><b>Do not profit by the blood of your fellow.</b></i> Two other translations for this clause are “do not stand by idly” and “do not conspire against” your fellow.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:17"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.17-18">HANDLING ANGER IN ACTION AND THOUGHT (19:17–18)<br></br>The commandments in these two verses are particularly striking insofar as they command what one ought to feel. These laws deal with intentions and emotions. The biblical writers make no distinction between those laws that other people could monitor and enforce, and those that only God could watch, so to speak.<br></br></div><b>hate.</b> The corresponding Hebrew term denotes both an emotion and a cognitive state of being. Our ancestors recognized that it is difficult to separate one’s emotions from one’s attitudes and actions.<br></br><i><b>incur no guilt on their account.</b></i> There are a multitude of interpretations for this clause. Some suggest that if you do not reprove the offending individuals, you become an accomplice in their wrongdoing. Others believe that if you do not face the source of your disquiet, it may grow into rage and possibly result in injury.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:18"><b>not take vengeance or bear a grudge.</b> Taking vengeance means a deed, and bearing a grudge reflects thought. Again, deed and thought—act and intention—are interwoven.<br></br><i><b>Love your fellow.</b></i> The verb for love, <i>ahav,</i> is here followed by the preposition using the letter <i>lamed</i> (“l” in English). This form is found in only four cases in the Bible; Abraham Malamat notes that in all four cases, there is an implication of action, not just feeling (“You Shall Love…,” 1990). See, for example, Leviticus 19:34, where Israelites are commanded to love the foreigner in their midst, which implies merciful and kind action.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:19"><div class="head2" id="levi_v-19">MAINTAINING DISTINCT CATEGORIES (19:19)<br></br>This verse forbids the breeding or mixing of animals, seeds, or cloths of different species or categories (see also Deuteronomy 22:9–11). The rationale behind this prohibition is connected to the rationale behind the dietary laws (Leviticus 11, Deuteronomy 14), the law that forbids cross-dressing (Deuteronomy 22:5), and the law requiring that animals die for killing human beings (Exodus 21:29). Our ancestors believed that species and gender were set out at creation and were to be maintained as distinct categories. Genesis 1:20–30 describes the creation of trees according to their kind, and animals according to their place in the world; Genesis 1:27 states that God created human beings, male and female. Mary Douglas has shown that the dietary laws are an attempt to maintain these clear categories and differentiations. It is this kind of thinking, in sharp categories and distinctions, that leads to the banning of same-sex sexual relations in the Bible (see at Leviticus 20:13) and in other ancient texts—and that assigns different dress, behavior, and social roles for women and men.<br></br></div><b>mixture.</b> Heb. <i>shaatnez</i>; the word’s precise meaning is unclear. It appears in the Bible only here and in Deuteronomy 22:11 (which clarifies that this term refers to a combination of wool and linen). Languages related to Hebrew seem to lack a similar word.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:20"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.20-22">AMBIGUOUS STATUS OF THE SLAVE WOMAN (19:20–22)<br></br>The transition to this topic is rooted in the idea that it is problematic to mix categories. In this case, the “mixing” involves sexual relations, and the complication concerns a woman who is both a slave and an intended wife. The slave woman has been designated for a man (who is not her owner) when another man has sexual relations with her. This passage portrays the woman as an object: the man performs the sexual act upon her (on this idiom, see at Exodus 19:15); and the guilty party is the man who has offended both her current owner and God, to whom the offender must make amends through a ritual sacrifice. The fate of the woman is not the primary concern of the writers of this text. They do not address whether she is likely to remain a slave or to become the wife of the prospective husband. (See also Exodus 21:7–11 for laws about women sold into slavery.)<br></br></div><b>has carnal relations.</b> The verb <i>shachav,</i> “to lie down” or “to engage in sexual intercourse,” can take either the direct-object marker <i>et</i> or the preposition <i>im</i> (“with”). In this case, the writer has used the former. This grammatical form—in which the object is relatively passive—may be a linguistic convention, or it may be a clue to the priestly understanding of the relationship between the sexes in this case.<br></br><i><b>slave.</b></i> In Leviticus 25, also part of the Holiness Code, the writers abolish slavery completely for all Israelites. This contradiction suggests that Leviticus 19 is a compilation of laws from various sources whose purpose was to express the specific concerns of this particular school of ancient Israel (see at 19:2). If the woman in this case had not been a slave, Deuteronomy 22:23–27 would have applied, prescribing the death penalty for the woman and man. But the woman here is in an ambiguous state, for she is both a slave woman and a nearly betrothed woman. As seen in v. 19, the Holiness Code writers are particularly interested in liminal states and concerned about confusion caused by overlapping categories.<br></br><i><b>indemnity.</b></i> The corresponding Hebrew word appears only here in the Bible; others translate it as “inquisition.” The question is whether an investigation to clarify her status is required or whether the offender is required simply to pay a fine to the man who owns the woman (either the current master or the future husband).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:21"><b>reparation offering.</b> Since this illicit sexual act is not subject to the death penalty (v. 20), the offender must appease God through a sacrificial offering.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:23"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.23-25">FIRST FRUITS (19:23–25)<br></br>The Holiness Code writers believed that the community of Israel maintains holiness not only by the way it treats its members and the sancta (the sacred things), but also by the way it cares for the fruit of the land. One was not to pick fruit from new fruit-bearing trees for three years. In the fourth year, Israelites would dedicate the first fruits to God.<br></br></div><b>you shall regard its fruit as forbidden.</b> Literally, “you shall treat as foreskin its foreskin with its fruit.” As Jacob Milgrom has argued, the foreskin refers to the fruit while it is still in its bud; therefore the text commands the removal of the buds—with the incipient fruit inside—from juvenile trees during their first few years (<i>Leviticus 17–22,</i> 2000, p. 1679). Thus, the term <i>arel</i> (“foreskin” or “uncircumcised”) here has both a literal meaning (referring to the bud) and a metaphoric meaning (referring to its forbidden nature).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:24"><b>set aside.</b> Heb. <i>kodesh;</i> that is, the fruit is to be considered <i>kadosh</i> (holy). This designation is no coincidence; biblical literature commonly distinguishes between “the uncircumcised” (see at v. 23) as foreign to God and “the holy” as a part of God.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:26"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.26-28">WHAT WE DO WITH OUR BODIES (19:26–28)<br></br>These prohibitions refer to practices that the writers associated with non-Israelite worship.<br></br></div><b>You shall not eat…blood.</b> In Leviticus, meat may not be consumed until the blood has been drained and offered to God. The biblical writers understood blood as being the life-source of a being (as in 17:11; Deuteronomy 12:23).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:27"><b></b>–<b><i>28.</i></b> These prohibitions refer to certain acts of mourning in the ancient Near East (see also at Deuteronomy 14:1–2). Mourning acts that the Bible considers appropriate include wearing sackcloth and ashes, and fasting.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:28"><b>incise any marks.</b> The corresponding Hebrew term appears nowhere else and, in this context, is assumed to refer to tattoos.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="19:33"><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.29-30">THE SACRED STATUS OF DAUGHTERS (19:29–30)<br></br>These verses reflect one of the central themes in the Holiness Code as a whole: the Israelite role in the maintenance and expansion of holiness. On the surface, v. 29 simply seems to prohibit the use of daughters as prostitutes. The key word in this verse is “degrade,” which should be rendered more accurately as “desecrate.” The verb <i>ch-l-l</i> is a technical term in the Holiness Code indicating a decrease in the level of holiness. The use of this verb implies that the daughter is not only a member of society, but also bears the responsibility for aspects of holiness in the community. If a father puts his daughter in a position that diminishes her holiness, that action affects the entire land negatively. This point is made even more strongly by coupling this teaching with a reminder to observe Shabbat and to keep watch over God’s holy space. To some degree, the holiness of a daughter is akin to the holiness of the sanctuary.<br></br></div><div class="head2" id="levi_v-31">CONSULTING GHOSTS AND SPIRITS (19:31)<br></br>Some scholars argue that consulting ghosts and using divination was problematic because of their inherent magical tendencies, that is, the attempt to manipulate the divine realm. Others assert that there were bans on such practices because they were considered too pagan-like. These conclusions fail, however, given the use of Urim and Thummim by the biblical priests (see Exodus 28:30), for this was a pagan-like device that arguably manipulates the divine. Therefore, one might conclude that the prohibition was motivated in part by the desire to curtail women’s access to the divine. (See further at 20:6.)<br></br></div><div class="head2" id="levi_v-32">RESPECT FOR ELDERS (19:32)<br></br>The biblical tradition is consistent in its call for respect and care for the elderly.<br></br></div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.33-34">CARE FOR THE STRANGER (19:33–34)<br></br>Every law collection in the Bible advocates care for the foreigner who resides in the land of Israel (for example, Exodus 22:20; 23:9; Deuteronomy 14:29; 24:14, 17). These admonitions frequently remind the reader that our ancestors were once strangers in the land of Egypt and that we should remember the vulnerability of the outsider. Elsewhere in the Bible, the stranger is mentioned alongside the widow and orphan.<br></br></div><b>strangers.</b> The <i>ger</i> was the non-Israelite who lived either temporarily or long-term in the Land of Israel but did not belong to the ethnic (later political) body of Israel.

Although some extra-biblical evidence suggests that such practices did take place, the biblical writers—as anti-pagan polemic—probably exaggerate their extent (see also Leviticus 18:21 and Jeremiah 7:31 on child sacrifice).<br></br></div><b>profaned My holy name.</b> Traditional Jewish commentators have interpreted this phrase to mean that one can damage God’s reputation among the nations of the world through wrong actions. The concept is still current today in describing public acts that can bring shame upon the people Israel and its God as acts of <i>chillul haShem.</i> However, in the context of the Holiness Code, the teaching is much more profound, for the message is that wrong human actions can actually have an impact upon that aspect of God known as <i>shem,</i> name. One can increase God’s holiness through right actions, and one can diminish God’s presence in the world through wrong actions. Holiness, being pliable and malleable (see 19:2), is the arena in which persons are in relationship with the Divine. God is affected by human actions—both the good and the bad. According to the Holiness Code, God does not remove the divine Presence (<i>kavod</i>) from Israel’s midst, nor does God act out of great wrath. God may detach an individual from the covenantal promises (“I will set My face against X…whom I will cut off from among the people,” 17:10; 20:3; 20:6); but more often, wrongdoing simply diminishes God’s <i>shem.</i></div><div class="head2" id="levi_v-6">CONSULTING GHOSTS AND SPIRITS (20:6)<br></br>The ban on practicing necromancy and certain types of divination appears three times in this parashah (19:31; here; and 20:27).

The ultimate goal is for the community to sanctify itself by observing the precepts outlined in the Code and to strive for holiness at all times. The reason behind this goal is that God is holy and that the proper medium for a connection between God and Israel is holy action. Through proper action, the people come closer to God, and God reaches out toward the community.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="tab-enin" ref="20:9"><div class="head2a"><i>Family and Sex Ethics</i> (20:9–21)<br></br></div><div class="tab-en">This unit closely parallels the material found in Leviticus 18. Both units list incest taboos, laws against male anal penetration, and prohibitions against adultery, bestiality, and Molech worship. The present unit adds prohibitions against cursing parents and the use of seers. Leviticus 20 organizes these laws by the severity of the punishment, whereas Leviticus 18 orders its material according to family relationships. The wording of some of the specific laws differs, but the basic sense of the prohibitions is similar in the two units.<br></br></div><b></b> This verse introduces the new unit on sexual taboos; see further at Leviticus 18. Illicit sexual relationships, especially incest, are understood to be destructive to the family and clan.<br></br><i><b>shall be put to death.</b></i> Heb. <i>mot yumat,</i> the technical term for the death penalty as prescribed by a court of law. In most cases within Torah, capital punishment was to be carried out by stoning.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="20:10"><b></b> The parallel passage in Leviticus 18:20 indicates that when a man has sexual relations with his neighbor’s wife, it makes both parties impure. In contrast, this verse and Deuteronomy 22:22 specify that both the man and the woman are to be put to death. These passages focus on the man as the subject and provide no information about the woman’s complicity in the illicit sexual act. Some have argued that killing the woman makes the woman accountable for her own actions and therefore grants her a level of personhood that is absent from the text in Leviticus. It is also possible that the woman is to be put to death to avoid paternity confusion.<br></br><i><b>If a man commits adultery.</b></i> Adultery in the Bible pertains to a sex act between a man and a married or betrothed woman; sex between a married man and a woman not designated to another man is not considered adultery.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="20:12"><b>If a man lies with his daughter-in-law.</b> Both here and in Leviticus 18, there is no prohibition against a man having sexual relations with his own blood daughter, which is highly problematic. See <i>Acharei Mot,</i> Another View.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="20:13"><b>If a man lies with a male.</b> Penile penetration with emission of semen defines the sexual act, so it is not surprising that there is no prohibition against female-with-female sex acts. What we today might define as sexual or erotic activity between two women was not a category of thought in the biblical mind-set. The “problem” with male-with-male sex acts apparently was that it put one man in the receptive position, thus emasculating him and confusing sex roles (see at 19:19 regarding the importance of maintaining category distinctions). (See also at 18:22.)</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="20:16"><b>If a woman approaches any beast.</b> This is the only verse in the unit in which the woman is the subject and agent of the action.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="20:18"><b>menstrual condition.</b> Heb. <i>davah,</i> a relatively rare term that elsewhere conveys a sense of physical and emotional vulnerability (see also at 12:2 and 15:33). Possibly the primary concern behind this verse’s prohibition is not sexual intercourse with a menstruant (since it does not say <i>niddah,</i> “menstruant”), but sexual intercourse with a woman who is not well. This may include a woman’s discomfort during menstruation and other conditions in which there is a genital flow due to illness. Leviticus 15:24 establishes a period of seven days of impurity for a man who lies with a menstruant. Our passage prescribes <i>kareit,</i> a cutting off from the community—either as an untimely death or some other form of exclusion (see at 7:20). Leviticus 15 is concerned with impurities and their contagion, while the present unit attempts to curtail certain sexual acts. In other words, the same act is viewed differently through two different social (or theological) lenses.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="chap" id="ano30-1"><i><b>Another View</b></i><div class="tab-en"><br></br> P<small>ARASHAT</small> K<small>’DOSHIM ARTICULATES</small> more comprehensively than any other portion of the Torah what it means for persons and community to be holy. Dictionary definitions of the Bible’s concept of holiness emphasize the notion of separation. In <i>parashat K’doshim</i>, however, holiness comes from cultivating relationships. Connections—not only separations—define the holy community: the connection to parents whom one must honor, to the poor and the disadvantaged whom one must protect, to the neighbor and stranger whom one must love, and of course to God.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>God commands Israel to “love” three times in the Torah. One case is in the text that follows the <i>Sh’ma</i> (“You shall love your God יהוה with all your heart,” Deuteronomy 6:5), known as the <i>V’ahavta.</i> Our parashah mentions the other two commands: to love the one who is a member of one’s group (“Love your fellow [Israelite] as yourself,” 19:18); and finally, to love the stranger (19:34). Loving the stranger is a unique notion in the ancient world. The verse’s rationale for loving the stranger—“for you were strangers in the land of Egypt”—has continuing ramifications that are often overlooked: the proper response to having suffered abuse is not vengeance or special entitlement, but rather sensitivity and determination to prevent such an abuse of others, including strangers. The three commandments are three dimensions of a single, deep connection: to love God is to love others, those like us and those who are not.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>Ruth the Moabite stands as the exemplar of what it means to love, including loving the stranger. While still in the land of Moab, Ruth vows an undying loyalty to Naomi, Naomi’s people, and Naomi’s God (Ruth 1:16–17). After she arrives in Bethlehem, Ruth’s behavior and commitment become a model for others: Boaz acknowledges that his kindness to Ruth is prompted by her prior generosity to Naomi (2:11); and the women of the town proclaim that Naomi’s eventual reversal of fortune came about because of “your daughter-in-law, who loves you” (4:15). Even without using the word <i>kadosh</i> (“holy”), the story of Ruth points to the transformation that the “love commandments” in this parashah can bring about—and to the ways that these precepts serve to sanctify life and community.</div><div class="image"><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="right1"><br></br><i>—Tamara Cohn Eskenazi</i></div><div class="image1"><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot2.jpg"/></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"><br></br> </div></div><div class="chap" id="ano30-2"><i><b>Post-biblical Interpretations</b></i><div class="tab-en"><br></br> <b><i>You shall be holy</i></b> (19:1). Commentators have been challenged by the interweaving of ritual and civil commandments in <i>parashat K’doshim</i>. Observing that both Leviticus 18 and 20 list prohibited sexual partners, Rashi suggests that 19:1 teaches that separating ourselves from forbidden sexual relations and transgressions is the path to holiness, “for every place (in the Torah) you find instruction to fence yourself in against such relations, you also find mention of holiness.” Nachmanides views this verse as commanding moderation in satisfying physical urges such as eating, drinking, and sexual relations.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br><i><b>Do not deal basely with members of your people</b></i> (19:16). The Rabbis identify these words as the source for the prohibition against <i>l’shon hara</i> (evil speech or gossip). Even if what we are saying is true, if it is negative and the person is not present to defend herself, it is prohibited (Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah, Hilchot De’ot 7.2).</i> The Talmud teaches that <i>l’shon hara</i> kills three parties: the person speaking, the person listening, and the person against whom the comment is being made (BT <i>Arachin</i> 15b–16a).</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br><i><b>Reprove your kin…incur no guilt on their account</b></i> (19:17). The double verb in the command <i>hochei-ach tochi-ach</i> (whose plain sense is: “you shall [<i>surely</i>] reprove”) has inspired much commentary. According to BT <i>Arachin</i> 16b, the first part of this verse teaches that when someone has done something offensive, confrontation is essential. While many people might hesitate out of fear of stirring up conflict and resentment, Midrash <i>B’reishit Rabbah</i> 54.3 urges confrontation as a way to improve understanding and increase caring. BT <i>Arachin</i> 16b also suggests that the command to rebuke is doubled in order to teach us that when we do confront the offending individuals, if they do not correct their behavior we must go back and confront them again. But—the Talmud continues—we must not embarrass such persons, making sure that we “incur no guilt on their account.” Rashi advises that we avoid causing embarrassment by making sure not to confront others in public.</div><div class="image"><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>In BT <i>Bava M’tzia</i> 31a, Rava teaches that the Torah’s double verb in the command means that we must rebuke even an authority figure, such as a teacher, parent, or employer. Ibn Ezra comments that confrontation can clear up misunderstandings and obviate resentment or even hatred. BT <i>Shabbat</i> 54b insists that we speak out to prevent wrongdoing; failing to do so leaves us partly responsible for injustice, whether in our family, our community, or even the world at large. Our sources are divided on what to do about the person who will not listen. BT <i>Shabbat</i> 55a suggests that only God really knows how a person will respond, and so we are <i>always</i> obligated to confront the person who is doing something wrong.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br><i><b>Love your fellow</b></i> [<b><i>Israelite</i></b>] <b><i>as yourself</i></b> (19:18). Rabbi Akiba said that this is the most important teaching in the Torah. For Ibn Ezra, this verse teaches us to treat others the way we want to be treated (so also Midrash <i>Sifra, K’doshim</i> 2.4). Other rabbis suggest we should express this love by being a good friend and neighbor, and by accepting the rebuke of others in a loving way.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br><i><b>If a man lies with a male as one lies with a woman…they retain the bloodguilt</b></i> (20:13). While Rashi and others understood this verse as specifically prohibiting anal intercourse, BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 54a-b saw it (along with 18:22) as prohibiting male homosexual acts in general. While Rabbi Judah forbade two bachelors to sleep under the same blanket, a majority of the Rabbis of the Talmud permit it (BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 82a). Maimonides agreed, stating that “Jews are not suspected of engaging in homosexual relations” (<i>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Intercourse</i> 22.2). This disagreement persists in later codes, with some, like the <i>Shulchan Aruch,</i> counseling against two men sleeping under the same blanket.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>The Rabbis limited their reading of this verse to male homosexual acts, noting that the Torah nowhere explicitly prohibits sex between two women. However, in BT <i>Y’vamot</i> 76a, Rav Huna argued that women who engage in lesbian sex cannot marry priests. Rabbi Eliezer urged leniency, on the grounds that sex between women does not involve penetration and therefore is “mere indecency.” <i>Sifra, Acharei Mot</i> 9.8, prohibits marriage between women as something done by the Egyptians that, based on Leviticus 18:3, we must not imitate. Maimonides combined these two teachings in his <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (<i>Laws of Forbidden Intercourse</i> 21.8), noting that sexual relations between women are prohibited because they are among the “ways of the Egyptians,” but that such acts are not punished with stoning or even lashes, as there is no act of penetration and the women violate no explicit biblical prohibition. A woman who has engaged in lesbian sex would be permitted to marry or stay married, even to a priest. Still, Maimonides says that such a woman should be punished with lashes for breaking a rabbinic law, and he advises husbands not to allow their wives to spend time with women known as lesbians, to avoid their being tempted to engage in sexual relations with another woman.</div><div class="right1"><br></br>—<i>Ruth H.

Here we are told what to be. We find a similar statement in Exodus 19:6, commanding us to be a “kingdom of priests and a holy people.” But what does it mean to be holy? <i>K’doshim</i> does not tell us. The guidance that the parashah gives us is in the specifics: the “who, when, why, and how” of the injunction.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>First, <i>who</i> is to be holy? The entire people is addressed: <i>kol adat b’nei yisrael;</i> all Israel is told: “You shall be holy, for I, your God יהוה, am holy” (19:2). Not just the priests or Levites, not only the women or men, but everyone is part of this command to be holy. The 16th-century commentator Rabbi Moshe Alshech asks why such important rules as the ones that follow upon this verse are not taught person by person, group by group, rather than to one large assembly. He suggests that the opening of <i>K’doshim</i> emphasizes the ability of any Jew to attain even the highest and noblest principles of Judaism; thus these laws, and the paradigm of “holiness,” are not only for a select few, but for everyone.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br><i>When</i> are we to be holy? The verb <i>tih’yu</i> in verse 2 can be read—and is often read—as a command (“be holy!”). But it is grammatically a future form (“you shall be holy”). The implications are: “Be holy—now! And you shall be holy—in the future.” Thus holiness is a daily struggle, in the here and now, as well as a future yearning.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br><i>Why</i> are we to be holy? Because God is holy. The 16th-century commentator Rabbi Obadiah Sforno notes that this verse teaches us that we are to remember and act “in the image of our Creator,” as much as that is possible. Philosophers refer to this concept via the Latin term <i>imitatio dei.</i> We try and “imitate” the Divine. As God cares for the widow and orphan, so do we. As God rests on the seventh day, so do we. In imitating God we can achieve a higher sense of purpose and our actions will reflect the ongoing concern of the Divine for the world. In imitating God’s holiness we make holiness our behavioral ideal.</div><div class="image"><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/></div><div class="image0"><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/></div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>In much of the Torah, it is God who sanctifies—as we read in Genesis 2:3: “Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy.” But in <i>K’doshim,</i> the command to make things holy is addressed to humanity. The task of sanctifying our lives is placed upon us, as an act of partnership between human beings and God. This is one way that we strive to act in God’s image.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>The <i>how</i> to be holy is what follows—as the parashah lists a wide-ranging series of ethical laws, including honoring one’s parents, respecting the elderly, justice for the stranger, love of one’s fellow human, and more. But note that even though the parashah enumerates the specifics of holy behavior, it never defines what it means by the word <i>kadosh</i> (“holy”). Many commentators have tried to understand the term <i>kadosh</i> as indicating a state of being. Rashi (11th century) and Ramban (13th century) both interpret “you shall be holy” as meaning “you shall be separate.” For them, holiness requires standing apart as Jews, with a firm set of boundaries. The end of <i>K’doshim</i> underscores their point: “You shall be holy to Me, for I יהוה am holy, and I have set you apart from other peoples to be Mine” (20:26).</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>This concept of separation is critical to understanding Jewish spirituality. For example, in the classic Jewish marriage formula, the phrase <i>harei at m’kudeshet li</i> means “you are set apart for me from others.” (Wedding officiants are fond of claiming that it means “you are sanctified to me,” which is a more midrashic derivation.) In the Talmud, <i>hekdesh</i> is money or goods set aside or separated for tithing or donation. Holiness seems intrinsically linked in Judaism to separation (<i>havdalah</i>), making distinctions: milk or meat, Shabbat or weekday, Jew or gentile, female or male.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>But does this concept of spirituality ring true for women? Would there be a different kind of <i>imitatio dei</i> for women? Do women experience holiness differently? For those women who carry life inside, attached to another being who is—at the same time—part of them, separateness does not equal spirituality. For those women who breastfeed—who nurture and sustain from their very own bodies—connection is more at the root of holiness. For those women who form bonded friendships from earliest memory, or who bring the family together, who are the cohesive force in a group, a definition of holiness is needed that does not imply building fences. Thus, though <i>parashat K’doshim</i> demands holiness, it is up to us to define holiness in a way that is truthful for both women and men.</div><div class="tab-enin"><br></br>As is apparent, then, Rashi’s definition of <i>kadosh</i> as “separate” presents a fundamental feminist challenge. The challenge is evident as well throughout rabbinic Judaism where authorities have portrayed the mitzvot as drawing lines between “us” and “them,” lines that demarcate who is <i>in</i> (for example, circumcision marking a Jewish boy) and who is <i>out</i> (for example, the halachah of not counting women in a minyan). While feminists have challenged specific mitzvot, finding a way “in” through creative rereading and even reinventing, we have not yet sufficiently challenged the very notion of mitzvot that rest upon the “spirituality of separation.” This notion is at the heart of much that Jews do—including kashrut, Shabbat, and the marriage ceremony, just to name a few. Redefining the mitzvot as connectors rather than as boundaries, as dialogue rather than as answers, is a first step toward addressing the question of how we as women will be <i>kadosh.</i> Although we are still at the beginning of exploring what a fully developed feminist notion of being holy might look like, the opening words of this parashah—<i>k’doshim tih’yu</i>—carry both a command for now and promise for the future: we can and we will find ways to be holy.</div><div class="right1"><br></br><i>—Elyse Goldstein</i></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"><br></br> </div></div>
