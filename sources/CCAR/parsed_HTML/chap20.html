  (“you shall instruct”) adds to the previous parashah’s elaborate instructions for constructing the Tabernacle complex and furnishings, by giving detailed information about the vestments for the priests (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
   28:1–43
  </a>
  ). Most of this information concerns the sacral garments for the chief priestly official, Aaron. As the one whose priestly functions bring him closest to the invisible presence of God in the Holy of Holies, his apparel must be of the same order of sanctity as the materials used for the holiest areas of the tent shrine.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The next order of business concerns the consecration service (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_29.1-46">
   29:1–37
  </a>
  ). An investiture (or ordination) ceremony will be necessary to confer upon Aaron and his subordinates the requisite sanctity for approaching God and performing their priestly tasks. A supplement (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e29-38">
   29:38–46
  </a>
  ) gives advance information about the regular sacrifices that will take place at the Tabernacle, and about God’s availability there once the whole complex and its priests are sanctified.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Flanking the lengthy materials about vestments and consecration are two brief passages: one involves the oil for the daily ritual of lighting the lamps in the sacred tent (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_27.20-21">
   27:20–21
  </a>
  ), and the other the incense altar (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_30.1-10">
   30:1–10
  </a>
  ); both items are functionally related to the priests’ role.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The wealth of detail about Aaron and his sons provides a stark portrayal of how males dominated the communal sacred lives of the ancient Israelites. Only later, in
  <i>
   parashat Vayak’heil
  </i>
  , will the minor presence of some female personnel at the communal religious shrine become apparent. There, we read about the women who are experts in making textiles (
  <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-22">
   35:25–26
  </a>
  ) and “the women who performed tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (
  <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e38-8">
   38:8
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  In contrast to the seemingly limited participation of women in the institutions of the Tabernacle or Temple, women did play a prominent role in household religious life—carrying out religious practices deemed necessary for the well-being and survival of their families, such as rituals to achieve fertility, healthy pregnancy, and safe childbirth. Reproduction in the modern world has been medicalized; but traditional societies—including ancient Israel—addressed barrenness, difficult pregnancies and births, and infant mortality via religious practices carried out in the home. Although this information almost never emerges in the Bible, archeological and ethnographic data now provide strong evidence for these essential functions of Israelite women. (See further

  Olive oil was one of the major agricultural products of the Land of Israel. Not only did it serve as a clean-burning lamp fuel, but it provided the basic fat source for the ancient diet in the Mediterranean region. Olive oil also had cosmetic and medicinal uses; and it was used to consecrate objects and individuals (see at
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_29.1-46">
   29:7
  </a>
  ). Like blood and water, oil was a liquid associated with transformation and holiness. Olive trees provided relatively stable crops since they were not susceptible to the variations in rainfall and temperature that could harm other food supplies; thus they symbolize fertility in many biblical texts, like Psalm 128:3.

  Better, “crushed.” Small quantities of oil, as in this context, were probably extracted from olives by placing them in a stone basin or a depression in a rock and then pounding them repeatedly with a stone tool. Because the technology for producing olive oil was similar to the grinding of grain for bread, which was done almost entirely by women (see at
  <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-1">
   16:3
  </a>
  and
  <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#e25-30">
   25:30
  </a>
  ), and because women may have produced stone tools of this sort, the preparation of olive oil—at least in village settings in the Land of Israel—was likely a woman’s task.

  This designation for the sacred tent shrine appears here for the first time in Exodus. The term “meeting” (
  <i>
   mo’ed

  ) reflects the oracular function of such a shrine, in which God would “meet” with a human leader in order to communicate the divine will or provide answers to questions (see
  <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e33-7">
   33:7–11
  </a>
  ). The elaborate and costly Tabernacle (
  <i>
   Mishkan

  ) may be fictive, yet it seems to incorporate authentic traditions about a relatively small and simple tent shrine (Tent of Meeting) dating to the pre-monarchic era (see also the

  ike palaces, sacred shrines in the biblical world had coteries of servants to tend the needs of the occupant; in this case, the priests served God’s unseen presence. Appropriate garb for entry into the sacred space of the Tabernacle structure is specified for Aaron, who functions as chief or head priest. Aaron’s name appears many times in this priestoriented text, in contrast to its virtual absence from the equivalent unit in the Tabernacle descriptive texts (see at
  <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_39.1-31">
   39:1–31
  </a>
  ). The focus here is on Aaron’s garments; only three verses provide instructions for Aaron’s sons’ garments (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-40">
   28:40–43
  </a>
  ). Less elaborate clothing for the other priests, many of whom are to perform menial and messy tasks associated with the slaughter of animals in the courtyard, is also briefly mentioned.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The text does not indicate who will make the priestly apparel. However, because women were probably responsible for making textiles and clothing in ancient Israel, it is likely that they were responsible for producing the sacral garments, just as they were the ones who produced fabrics for the Tabernacle (see at

  This brief introduction names the priestly family, calls for the services of skilled artisans, and lists the items of clothing and materials to be used to make the priestly vestments. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see

   </b>
  </i>
  Although Aaron appears frequently in Exodus up to this point, this is the first place that his name is used together with the word “priest.” Aaron’s responsibilities as priest are said to include various matters of ritual (for example,
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e27-21">
   27:21
  </a>
  ;
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-35">
   28:35
  </a>
  ;
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e30-7">
   30:7–8
  </a>
  ), judicial proceedings (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-30">
   28:29–30
  </a>
  ), and instruction (
  <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.8-20">
   Leviticus 10:11
  </a>
  ). The Bible never refers to Aaron by the title “high priest”—a term that seems to refer to an office that developed over time so that its responsibilities included also temple finance and management.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  As the narrative presents it, Aaron seems to have become the head of the priestly line by virtue of being Moses’ brother. Both are from the family of Levi, and their association with Sinai serves to legitimate the Aaronide priesthood. We know from
  <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#e6-20">
   Exodus 6:20
  </a>
  that Aaron’s mother was Jochebed, and from
  <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#e6-20">
   6:23
  </a>
  that his wife was “Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon.”

  More information about the textile workers appears in

  and
  <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e36-6">
   36:6

  Altogether, Aaron will wear seven items (the six mentioned here plus the frontlet in
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-36">
   28:36–37

  ), seven being a symbol of perfection and totality. He will wear breeches too (
  <a href="#exo_28.1-43">

  RITUAL ITEMS FOR AARON (28:6–30)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Two highly specialized and somewhat enigmatic items of Aaron’s apparel, the ephod and breastpiece, will have a role in ritual practice. Their collective importance is signaled by the length of the passages devoted to instructions for making these two items; but how they are to be used is never explained. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see

  </i>
  The English noun is simply a transliteration of the Hebrew term. A number of diverse sources (Judges 8:24–27; I Samuel 2:18; II Kings 8:8–14) indicate that the ephod’s appearance and function changed over time. It was a ritual garment, a divinatory device, or sometimes both—as seems to be the case here, because of the ephod’s attachment to the “breastpiece of decision.”

  Engraving gemstones with their owners’ names, and sometimes with a design, was a highly developed craft in the ancient Near East. Engraved stones served as signets or seals and were used for legal or economic documents. Here, engraving the names of the twelve tribes—six on each stone—symbolizes the presence of all Israel in the decisions made with the ephod and gives authority to those rulings; it also carries the implicit hope for divine awareness of the people and their needs (see also at v. 12).

  Bells, which incorporate the sense of hearing into the sensory array of the shrine’s features, apparently had an apotropaic effect, meaning that they were intended to ward off evil. Sounds were believed to protect people, hence the notice that Aaron “will not die” as long as the noise can be heard. In this case, the danger would have been the intense holiness emanating from the presence of God as Aaron entered the holy zone of the Tabernacle.

A highly positive quality linked with the nature of God, holiness could be acquired through ritual acts by people, animals, places, and things; only then could they approach the powerful sanctity of God, which paradoxically could be dangerous as well as beneficent because of its extreme power.

  Making the priesthood the hereditary right of Aaron and his male offspring effectively precludes women from serving as officiants in the holy precinct. In this regard, the Israelites differed from other ancient peoples, for whom priestesses are mentioned. One possible explanation for the exclusion of women is a demographic one; that is, because infant mortality was high and women risked death in childbirth, women were needed for normal family life and thus were not separated out for Temple or Tabernacle service. (See further
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#page_489">

  God’s communication with humans will take place at the shrine. The “you” in this verse is singular, referring to Moses. The location of this meeting place seems to be the courtyard altar, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, or in front of the curtain that screens off the Ark (see
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e30-7">

  The verb “meet” from the previous verse is repeated, making it clear that God will be available to everyone there. The mechanism for the meeting is not clear; it is possible that Moses or Aaron is to be the intermediary.

  Incense altars were standard items in shrines in the ancient Near East, just as some mechanism for freshening the air was part of every household. This completes the sensory repertoire of items to be used in the interior space of the Tabernacle: sight, taste, sound, and now smell.

  Like the courtyard altar and the many small incense altars found in the Land of Israel by archeologists, the gilded incense altar’s horns probably would be at the upper corners, projecting upward (see at

  The incense altar’s central placement, directly in front of the textile panel that screens the Ark (and the unseen presence of God above it), will make it the most important of the three items of furniture in the room: incense altar, lampstand, and offering table. (On the latter two items, see at

  The wafting upward of the smoke of burning incense may represent a primitive metaphor in which God “smells” the incense in the earthly shrine and thereby notices the officiants and comes to meet them. Perhaps it also represents an attempt to communicate with the unseen Deity via something as ethereal as smoke. At the same time, the smoke conceals God’s presence from the officiant, for seeing God can be lethal (see
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#e16-12">

   ERTAIN BIBLICAL PASSAGES
  </small>
  show that women served in some capacity at the sanctuary. The clearest case is that of the women attendants at the Tent of Meeting (
  <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e38-8">
   38:8
  </a>
  ; I Samuel 2:22). Yet, in contrast to some other ancient cultures, there is no evidence of priestesses in ancient Israel. Scholars have proposed several theories to explain this absence, but none solves the mystery.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  One theory is that women could not be priests because they menstruated, making them periodically ritually unclean. However, menstruation is not considered any more defiling than other causes of ritual impurity (see
  <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">
   Leviticus 15
  </a>
  ). Priests could become ritually impure on occasion, yet once the period of impurity passed, they could go back to their priestly duties after performing the necessary ablutions. If menstrual impurity were the issue, why could women not perform communal religious functions during the rather lengthy times in their lives when they were not menstruating?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  A second theory is that the absence of women reflects a division of labor along gender lines and the needs of a pre-modern, agricultural community. Because women were needed to bear and raise children and to perform essential household tasks, they could not be spared for temple service. But then why did women function as priestesses in surrounding cultures?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  A third theory suggests that the women were priestesses elsewhere because they served in the sanctuaries of goddesses; but since Israel’s official religion did not sanction the worship of goddesses, there was no place in it for priestesses. However, a weakness of this theory is that priestesses in other ancient cultures served in sanctuaries of gods and goddesses alike.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  A fourth theory suggests that excluding women from the priesthood meant to distinguish Israel from her neighbors, who often employed women in rituals of a sexual nature. Note, however, that in all the surrounding cultures, female functionaries filled a diverse number of roles, not all of which were sexual in nature. Some women functioned as priestesses; others filled maintenance and support roles or served as singers, dancers, and musicians.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  A fifth theory is based on the claim that priestesses in the surrounding cultures did not conduct animal sacrifice—and that Israel followed its neighbors in this respect: women were not included because animal sacrifices constituted a central part of Israelite ritual. However, as Mayer Gruber notes, pictorial illustrations and written references to women slaughtering sacrifices are extant from all over the ancient Near East (“Women in the Cult According to the Priestly Code,” 1987, n. 37).
 </div>
 <div class="image">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="image0">
  <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  In evaluating these theories, one should take into account the fact that many of the surrounding cultures where we find priestesses were more economically developed and socially complex than was Israel. The smaller sanctuary that likely existed in ancient Israel—and the simpler procedures there—would have limited the number of functionaries in general. Furthermore, while the Bible legitimizes only male priests (from Aaron’s family), Israelite religion was surely more complex than what the text describes. Women probably had more roles in local sanctuaries than the Bible records.

    You shall further instruct the Israelites to bring you clear oil…for kindling lamps regularly
   </b>
  </i>
  (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_27.20-21">
   27:20
  </a>
  ). Reflecting on this commandment about kindling lights, medieval commentators offered two possible interpretations of the phrase
  <i>
   ner tamid
  </i>
  (literally “light regularly” but understood to mean “eternal lamp”). Rashi suggested it meant “routinely kindled,” while Nachmanides understood it as “continually burning.” In general, the latter interpretation—the image of an eternal, rather than a regularly kindled, light—predominated. In the rabbinic imagination, the eternal lamp of the synagogue recalled the
  <i>
   menorah
  </i>
  of Temple times, since rabbinic tradition associated the
  <i>
   ner tamid
  </i>
  with the westernmost or central lamp of the
  <i>
   menorah
  </i>
  in the Temple (
  <i>
   Sifra Emor
  </i>
  13.7). In a poem composed for the occasion of this Torah reading, the Byzantine Jewish liturgical poet Yannai drew a parallel between the synagogue’s eternal lamp and that of the “woman of valor,” whose “lamp never goes out at night” (Proverbs 31:18).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The Rabbis understood the eternal lamp as an important symbol with multiple meanings. First, they associated the light with Torah. For example, BT
  <i>
   B’rachot
  </i>
  57a teaches: “If one sees olive oil in a dream, one may hope for the light of the Torah, as it is written,
  <i>
   You shall further instruct…”
  </i>
  This association derives from Proverbs 6:23, which states:
  <i>
   The commandment is a lamp
  </i>
  /
  <i>
   And the Torah is a light.
  </i>
  The song
  <i>
   “Torah Orah
  </i>
  (The Torah is a Light),” popular in many contemporary synagogues during the Torah services, reflects this symbolism.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The Rabbis frequently represented the eternal lamp as symbolic of the divine presence, or
  <i>
   Shechinah.
  </i>
  In BT
  <i>
   M’nachot
  </i>
  87b, the Rabbis wonder why God would need a light; they then deduce that the eternal lamp commemorated the divine light that had led Israel through the wilderness. The reason the eternal lamp was the “western lamp” was because “the divine Presence will never depart from the Western Wall” (Midrash
  <i>
   Sh’mot Rabbah 2.2).
  </i>
  Over time, the ritual of the Temple lamp was transferred to the home. Thus, Mishnah
  <i>
   Shabbat
  </i>
  2:1 offers instructions for kindling Shabbat lights, which 2:6 then characterizes as a specifically female commandment. Yannai read those Mishnaic passages back into Exodus, linking the priestly rules for maintaining the Tabernacle’s lights with women’s command of
  <i>
   hadlakat nerot,
  </i>
  kindling lamps.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  The eternal lamp was also understood in post-biblical Judaism as foreshadowing the light of the messianic age. The lamps described in this parashah were popular in Byzantine and medieval synagogue art. These images, themselves multivalent, may have both memorialized the Temple destroyed in 70
  <small>
   C.E.
  </small>
  and also anticipated a time when the Temple lamps would be rekindled. As the poet Yannai wrote of those days to come, “And our light will no longer be quenched / and our flames no longer extinguished / and You shall be our everlasting light.”

 <div class="tab-en1">
  The medieval mystical compilation
  <i>
   Zohar
  </i>
  (2:99b) offers a spiritual understanding of the
  <i>
   ner tamid
  </i>
  when it states that
  <i>
   “ner”
  </i>
  is an acronym for
  <i>
   n’shamah-ruach
  </i>
  (“soul-spirit”). Together, soul and spirit represent a perfect union of masculine and feminine. Together, they can bring forth light; but separated, they are powerless and in the dark.

  (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
   28:2
  </a>
  ). The Rabbis taught that each item of the head priest’s ritual garb possessed symbolic value. The fringed tunic atoned for bloodshed; the robe, for slander; the breeches, for sexual impropriety; the headdress, for arrogance; the frontlet, for brazenness;
  <a id="page_491">

  the sash, for impure thoughts; the breastplate, for neglect of the civil laws; and the ephod, for idolatry (BT

  88b;
  <i>
   Vayikra Rabbah
  </i>
  10.6;
  <i>
   Shir HaShirim Rabbah
  </i>
  4.8). According to BT
  <i>
   Sotah
  </i>
  36b, it was Joseph’s desire to have his name engraved upon the ephod (along with the names of his brothers) that restrained him from succumbing to temptation with Potiphar’s wife (
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_39.1-23">
   Genesis 39
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  According to the
  <i>
   Zohar,
  </i>
  “All the priestly garments were emblematic of supernal mystery” (2:231a). This mystical reading focuses on the layered nature of the vestments, which indicate a balancing of dualities: left and right, soul and body, and male and female. The primordial human whom God created (
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
   Genesis 1
  </a>
  )—this passage teaches—was a singular creature, both male and female, but the two halves were joined at the back, facing away from each other. God separated this single entity into two, and “thus they [the first woman and first man] were brought face to face, [and] love was multiplied in the world.” Unfortunately, this physical division also led to emotional estrangement, jealousy, and strife. The unity of the ephod and breastplate (which were worn together) recalled the original unity of the first woman and the first man and, by extension, of all humankind.

  , this Torah portion is read during the week preceding Purim. The connection between the parashah and Purim is not immediately apparent.
  <i>
   T’tzaveh
  </i>
  is filled with exacting details about the assembly of the priestly garments and the ritual role Aaron and his sons are to perform as anointed priests. The book of Esther is a melodramatic tale of threat, intrigue, and ultimate redemption through plot twists and the reluctant heroism of a beautiful queen.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  While the plots and purposes of these texts are vastly different, each in its own way, asks us to confront an absence.
  <i>
   T’tzaveh
  </i>
  is the only parashah from the beginning of the book of Exodus until the end of Deuteronomy where the name of Moses does not appear. And Esther is one of only two books of the Bible where the name of God does not appear. These absences are cause for abundant commentary in each individual case, but the relationship between the two texts seems to receive only passing mention.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  What insight can this parallel
  <i>
   presence of absence
  </i>
  convey?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Many commentators speculate as to why Moses’ name is absent from
  <i>
   parashat T’tzaveh.
  </i>
  One theory is that the omission is meant to acknowledge the anniversary of his death, which is said to be the seventh of Adar, just one week before Purim. Another theory is that Moses’ name is left out as divine admonishment for his jealousy over Aaron’s appointment as chief priest. Still others maintain that in his humility and self-effacement, Moses graciously cedes the role to his brother and absents himself from the narrative, so to speak, to make this clear.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Regardless of the reaction that Moses may or may not have experienced when his brother became the head priest instead of him, the narrative suggests that although his name is not mentioned, Moses remains God’s agent—the enabler for all that is to happen. This is made evident through an unusual grammatical formulation found in the parashah’s opening verses. Elsewhere in Torah, God’s commands to Moses are stated in the simple imperative: “instruct” (
  <i>
   tzav)
  </i>
  or “speak” (
  <i>
   dabber
  </i>
  ). In
  <i>
   T’tzaveh,
  </i>
  however, three instances of an additional pronoun appear, giving extra
  <a id="page_492">
  </a>
  emphasis to the actor responsible for the actions. Translating the text more literally, the first verse of the parashah (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_27.20-21">
   27:20
  </a>
  ) reads: “And
  <i>
   you, yourself
  </i>
  shall command the children of Israel.” Shortly thereafter, we read: “And
  <i>
   you,
  </i>
  bring near
  <i>
   to yourself
  </i>
  your brother Aaron, with his sons, from among the Israelites, to serve Me as priests” (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
   28:1
  </a>
  ). The same grammatical form appears two lines later:
  <i>
   “You, yourself
  </i>
  speak to all who are skillful, whom I have endowed with the gift of skill, to make Aaron’s vestments” (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
   28:3
  </a>
  ). The 16th-century commentator Moshe Alshekh suggests that this repeated double emphasis is God’s way of saying to Moses, “It’s all really you. You have a greater share in it than anyone. All fulfill themselves through you” (cited in Nehama Leibowitz,
  <i>
   Studies in Shemot,
  </i>
  1980, p. 526). Perhaps such language means to tell us that Moses is not absent at all. Rather, his presence is momentarily diminished so that other leaders can step forward to serve the broader needs of the community.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  Just as we can see Moses as a behind the scenes mover in the parashah, so too, can we see God as filling a similar role in the Purim narrative. While many interpret the Purim story as an instance when the Jews achieved victory through their own actions—without waiting for divine intercession—the classic rabbinic interpretation is that God was hidden from view, but not absent. In BT
  <i>
   Chullin
  </i>
  139b, the Rabbis made this point through a biblical proof text, asking: “Where is Esther indicated in the Torah? In the verse ‘I will surely hide (
  <i>
   astir
  </i>
  ) My face’ (
  <a href="55_chapter_52.xhtml#deu31-16">
   Deuteronomy 31:18
  </a>
  ).” The Hebrew word
  <i>
   astir
  </i>
  (“I will hide”) serves as a wordplay on Esther’s name.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  We can extend the wordplay even further by considering that the Hebrew word
  <i>
   m’gillah
  </i>
  shares the same root as the verb “to reveal” (
  <i>
   g-l-h).
  </i>
  Thus,
  <i>
   M’gillat Ester
  </i>
  (“Scroll or Book of Esther”) can be read playfully as “revealing the hidden.” God’s presence is revealed through Mordecai’s conviction and Esther’s courage. God’s presence is revealed in the triumph of good over evil, in the flawed but ultimately responsible actions of human beings.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en1">
  In a typical Purim twist, the biblical text also reinforces the
  <i>
   presence of God’s absence
  </i>
  by pointing out the consequences of the
  <i>
   absence of God’s presence.
  </i>
  The story opens with a drunken debauchery hosted by King Ahasuerus, where “he displayed the glory of his kingdom and the richness of his magnificent splendor for many days, for 180 days” (Esther 1:4). The words used to describe the “glory” and “splendor” of his kingdom are the same words,
  <i>
   kavod u’tiferet,
  </i>
  that are used in
  <i>
   T’tzaveh
  </i>
  to describe the priestly garments (
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_28.1-43">
   28:2
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-40">
   40
  </a>
  ; there translated as “dignity and adornment”). In
  <i>
   T’tzaveh,
  </i>
  the lavish garments are designed to serve and honor God. In Esther, the King’s wealth is evidence of his corruption. The midrash draws an even more powerful connection by claiming that the riches of Ahasuerus’ kingdom were made up of the spoils of the Temple, including the priestly garments themselves (
  <i>
   Ester Rabbah
  </i>
  2.1).

  The Purim message that sometimes gets lost in all of the revelry is that a sense of God’s presence in the world, even if hidden and obscure, gives us the strength and moral purpose to cope with uncertainties and imperfections.
