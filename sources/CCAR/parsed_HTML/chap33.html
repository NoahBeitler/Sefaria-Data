<div class="chap1"><small>LEVITICUS 26:3–27:34
</small><i>Ensuring Obedience to God, and the Sanctuary’s Welfare
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> B<small>’CHUKOTAI</small> (“my laws”) concludes Leviticus, a book devoted to instructing the people of Israel how to conduct their lives in keeping with their status as God’s people. The first part of the parashah seeks to ensure obedience to these instructions by providing strong motivation in the form of a series of blessings and curses. God, through Moses, promises the people prosperity and peace if they follow the path laid out by God; and God threatens them with famine, war, and eventually exile, if they choose to spurn God’s laws and commandments (26:3–46). The second part of the parashah (27:1–34) is an appendix that addresses issues related to communal funding, especially of the priesthood and of the sanctuary.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Explicit information about women in these passages, while scant, does shed some additional light on their status and the nature of their household responsibilities in ancient Israel. Especially significant for our understanding of the status of women in this culture is the material in 27:3–7, which lists monetary equivalents for the worth of individuals whose services are vowed to the temple. Leviticus, we learn, bases these assessments and values on a combination of the factors of age and gender (see also Another View).
</div><div class="tab-enin">In addition, the content of 27:1–25, which deals with vows and gifts of property to the temple, touches upon several other issues that relate to the lives of women in ancient Israel, such as whose vows were binding and under what conditions, who could partake in the priests’ portion of sacrificial animals (a major source of food for priests and their households), and who could inherit and possess property. While Leviticus 27 does not directly deal with these issues, all of them are crucial for those wishing to understand the significance of the instruction in this text for women in ancient Israel.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The explicit reference in 26:26 to women who bake bread further highlights the lives of women.

</div></div><div class="note"><div class="head" ref="26:3"><i>Epilogue</i></div><div class="head1" ref="26:3">ENSURING OBEDIENCE TO GOD (26:3–46)<div class="tab-en">The opening unit of the parashah presents an epilogue to the book of Leviticus as a whole. God addresses the Israelites who are about to enter the Promised Land, assuring them of great rewards if they follow God’s instructions, and threatening them with a series of increasingly severe punishments if they disobey. The laws pertain to women and men together as a community. The rewards and the punishments are symmetrical: the punishments reverse each of the promised rewards via a contrasting threat. For example, a promise of fertility of the land (vv. 4–5 and 10) contrasts with the threat of a barren and fruitless land (vv. 16, 19–20). The symmetry, among other things, expresses a balanced and ordered universe, a theme that is important in priestly writings (see Genesis 1). These blessings and curses resemble those that conclude Deuteronomy’s laws (Deuteronomy 28–30) and many ancient Near Eastern treaties. In all of these instances, the curses section tends to be much longer and more detailed than the blessings section, most likely to frighten the hearers into obedience through the threat of divine enforcement.
</div></div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.3-13" ref="26:3">BLESSINGS FOR OBEDIENCE (26:3–13)<div class="tab-enin">The blessings that will be bestowed upon Israel if the people follow God’s laws include: peace, prosperity, safety from wild beasts, fertility of both the people and the land, and victory over their enemies. God will uphold the covenant and reside in Israel’s midst, ensuring that the people will flourish and prosper and be free from all oppression.
</div></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:4"><b>rains in their season.</b> Survival in this agricultural economy depended on timely rain. Too much at the wrong time or too little devastated crops and resulted in famine. (See also Deuteronomy 11:11, 33:13.)</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:5"> The blessing will consist of having such bountiful harvests that the harvesting season will last until the next planting season.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:9"><b>I will…make you fertile.</b> On God’s role in fertility, see the introduction to Genesis 16:1–6 and at Deuteronomy 33:13.<br></br><b><i>I will maintain My covenant with you.</i></b> God’s covenantal faithfulness serves as guarantee that these promises will come true.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:11"><b>abode.</b> Heb. <i>mishkan</i> is translated elsewhere as “Tabernacle” (as in Exodus 25:9 Leviticus 8:10); here, however, the term carries a much broader sense. God assures the people that the Deity will reside with Israel in the land. The text emphasizes the presence of God with the people as a whole, not confined to the sanctuary.<br></br><b><i>I will not spurn you.</i></b> Spurning (or rejecting) is something of a leitmotif in this unit. First, God promises never to spurn Israel if the people follow the laws and commandments (v. 11). Next, if the people choose to spurn these laws and commandments (v. 15), the punishments will begin. Finally, God will spurn Israel temporarily should the people fail to return to God after a series of increasingly severe punishments (v. 30; but see v. 44, when God relents nonetheless).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:12"><b>I will be ever present in your midst.</b> Literally, “I will walk about in your midst.” This description might refer back to the story of the Garden of Eden when God is depicted as walking about the Garden (see Genesis 3:8). The establishment of God’s abode in Israel’s midst will ensure a period of prosperity and peace—as well as a palpable relationship with God.<br></br><i><b>I will be your God, and you shall be My people.</b></i> This expression refers back to the covenantal promise made at Sinai (Exodus 6:2–8) and reiterates mutual commitment.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:13"> The blessings’ section concludes by reminding Israel of their special relationship to God, and of what God has done for them in the past, thereby also alluding to what God is capable of doing for them in the future.</div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.14-45" ref="26:14">CURSES FOR DISOBEDIENCE (26:14–45)<br></br>In contrast to the rather brief section of blessings, the list of curses is longer and more detailed. It threatens Israel with the consequences that will follow if the people spurn God’s rules and fail to observe God’s laws. The curses in Leviticus 26:14–45 largely mirror the blessings in the previous section and also have many similarities to the curses in Deuteronomy 28:15–68. However, in Deuteronomy the curses appear as punishment, while here they are presented also as God’s attempt to influence the people to return to the right path (see vv. 18, 21, 23, and 27). With each increasingly severe measure, God hopes that Israel will have learned its lesson. The punishments will stop at any point when the Israelites relent and turn back to God.<br></br>These writings probably gave hope to the people of Israel after the Babylonian Exile (597/587–538 <small>B.C.E.</small>) because they provide an explanation for how God could have allowed the downfall of Jerusalem and the Exile to come about; Leviticus 26 also emphasizes the promise of restoration once the people repent.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:26"><b>ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven.</b> Many women will all share one oven, whether for lack of dough or for lack of wood to fuel the oven. Either way, the threat is that of famine. Variations on this theme are common in ancient Near Eastern curses. For example, a curse in the Aramaic Sefire inscription (mid-8th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) reads: “And may his seven daughters bake bread in an oven but not fill it”; and a curse in the bilingual Assyrian-Aramaic Tell Fekheriyeh inscription (9th century <small>B.C.E.</small>) reads, “May a hundred women bake bread in an oven and not fill it.”<br></br>[It appears that ovens were beehive-shaped forms, made of a mixture of chopped clay and straw, sometimes with broken shards pressed onto the oven. They could be slightly recessed into the ground. (See P. King and L. Stager, <i>Life in Biblical Israel,</i> 2001, p. 67.) They were generally in the courtyard and probably served several adjacent dwellings. But they could also be in interior space; a baker would more likely fire up an interior oven in cold rainy weather. The bread could be baked on a baking tray, set over the fire inside the oven. —<i>Ed</i>] Oven fuel consisted of branches or dung (see Malachi 3:19; Jacob Milgrom, <i>Leviticus 23–27,</i> 2001, p. 2314).<br></br>Here the text specifies women as the ones who bake the bread. This provides some insight into the division of labor in the ancient Israelite household. While women were the ones responsible for childbearing and childrearing, they also divided with men the other duties necessary to sustain and support the household. This text, then, provides evidence that women were predominantly responsible for tasks related to food production, that is, the transformation of raw foodstuffs into consumable goods. In the ancient world this was a very important and time-consuming task. Other biblical texts, through their association of women and food production in various forms, support this conclusion. For example, in I Samuel 28:24, the medium of En-dor prepares a calf and makes bread for King Saul. In Jeremiah 7:17–18, women are described as kneading dough for cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. In 1 Samuel 8:13, the prophet Samuel warns the people that monarchy will make many demands of them, including that the king “will take your daughters as perfumers, cooks, and bakers.” This last text implies that women indeed served those functions at the royal palace, as well as in ordinary households. See further at Exodus 16:3.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:29"><b>You shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.</b> The horrific prospect of cannibalism as a result of siege, extreme famine, or both is a recurrent theme in Israelite and other ancient Near Eastern curses. An extreme version of this theme appears in II Kings 6:28–29, when a king in besieged and famine-struck Samaria must decide between two women who had agreed to eat their respective children, first one and then the other, to stave off starvation. A conflict erupts when, after having shared in eating the first woman’s child, the second mother hides her son. (The story is an ironic twist on the episode in which King Solomon demonstrates his superb wisdom by determining which harlot is the rightful mother of a baby; see I Kings 3:16–28.) In Lamentations 2:20 and 4:10, references to women desperate enough to eat their own children show how terrible the situation for the people of Judah has become. In both of these texts, the image of women eating their children exemplifies a crisis so severe that it reverses even the maternal instinct: instead of being willing to sacrifice everything—even themselves—for their children, these mothers sacrifice their children in the most horrific way possible, so that they may live. The image is that of a world turned tragically upside down by the horrors of wartime siege and famine.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:30"><b>I will destroy your cult places and cut down your incense stands.</b> Biblical references use neutral terms for cult places (sometimes translated as “high places”) or local shrines in early stages of Israelite life but criticize these for the period after the building of the temple in Jerusalem (in the 10th or 9th century <small>B.C.E.</small>). For example, I Kings 22:44 and II Kings 15:35 mention people worshiping God at such high places; that author does not approve of the practice yet apparently tolerates it. More so than men, women most likely depended on local shrines to enable them to participate in communal events. (They probably also had home shrines.) The Bible—and probably the Israelites in general—apparently considered worship of God at these local shrines to be a legitimate religious outlet until centralization of worship at the Temple began to be enforced (see at Deuteronomy 12:2–14). The Bible suggests that this centralization began around the 7th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, in the reigns of King Hezekiah and, later, Josiah. The Bible associates worship at local shrines after that time with idolatry, regardless of who was worshiped there.<br></br>Centralization of worship probably had a huge impact on women, who would have been less able than men were to leave their families and their domestic and reproductive responsibilities in order to travel to Jerusalem. Once the worship of God at local shrines ceased to be legitimate, women lost important communal religious practices. When the Bible mentions women’s worship from the period of the monarchy on, it mostly categorizes it as worship of false deities, probably considered noteworthy because such practices undermined the central sanctuary. See, for example, the association of women with the worship of Asherah (I Kings 15:13 = II Chronicles 15:16; I Kings 18:19; and II Kings 23:4); references to female worship of the Queen of Heaven (Jeremiah 7:18 and 44:15–25); and women weeping for Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14). From an Israelite woman’s perspective, many of these practices were probably traditional and legitimate (see women’s defense of the worship in Jeremiah 44).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:32"> Those who will replace the deported or destroyed Israelites will be so horrified by the level of desolation and destruction of the land that they will wonder what the inhabitants had done to incur such divine wrath against them (see also Deuteronomy 29:21–23).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:34"><b>Then shall the land make up for its sabbath years.</b> In a case of poetic justice, the land in its desolation will at last lie fallow. This will make up for all of the years that the Israelites abused it by continuous cultivation, contravening laws such as Leviticus 25.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:41"><b>obdurate heart.</b> Literally, uncircumcised heart.” The metaphor implies that their heart is covered as if by uncircumcised foreskin: it is unresponsive and unfeeling.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:42"><b>Then will I remember My covenant.</b> This theme of God recalling the covenant and responding in compassion appears in Exodus 6:5 (in the context of the liberation from Egypt) and throughout the Bible. Especially interesting is Isaiah 54:1–10, where God addresses Israel as a wife and promises “her” eternal covenant faithfulness (in the context of restoration).<br></br><b><i>Jacob…Isaac…Abraham.</i></b> The reversed order of the patriarchs may reflect God’s looking backward in time to the very first commitment to this people.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:44"><b>I will not reject them or spurn them.</b> That is, even though Israel spurned God, God will never spurn Israel completely by annulling the covenant.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="26:45"><b>the covenant with the ancients, whom I freed from the land of Egypt.</b> Reference to the generation of the Exodus includes those who took part in the Sinai covenant.</div><div class="head2" id="levi_v.46" ref="26:46">CONCLUSION (26:46)<br></br>The book of Leviticus probably ended with this verse at one point. The reference to Sinai aims to emphasize the authority of these laws (see also at 25:1). The subsequent unit most likely is a later addition to this earlier conclusion.<br></br> <br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/dot1.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="note"><div class="head" ref="27:1"><i>Appendix</i></div><div class="head1" ref="27:1">THE SANCTUARY: FUNDING, GIFTS, AND DUES (27:1–34)<div class="tab-en">This last of Leviticus specifies how to make various dedications to the sanctuary, how their value is determined, and whether they can be redeemed (that is, whether a monetary substitute is acceptable). These details supplement the laws about sacrifices with which the book began (Leviticus 1–7). [Monetary valuation may also be related to the redemption laws of Leviticus 25 in that, like “actuary tables,” they help estimate what redemption costs might entail. —<i>Ed.</i>]
</div><div class="tab-enin">Vows are essentially conditional promises to God, to be fulfilled if and when the requested conditions come to pass. According to biblical portrayals, one is most likely to utter a vow at a time of great distress, when direct appeal to God seems the only option left. A person often promises to dedicate or sacrifice an animal; but sometimes one offers service to the shrine, either by oneself or one’s child, such as in the case of Hannah (I Samuel 1:1–11), who promises God that if granted a son, she will dedicate his service to the sanctuary at Shiloh. The warrior Jephthah vows to sacrifice what comes from his house; it turns out to be his daughter (Judges 11:29–40; see at Numbers 30:10). As an act of individual piety or desperation, one could utter a vow anywhere; therefore, vows were a popular form of religious devotion, one in which women could participate freely. (See additional references to women making vows in Numbers 6:2, 30:4–17; Jeremiah 44:15–25; and Proverbs 31:2.)
</div></div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.1-8" ref="27:1">VOTARY PLEDGES OF PEOPLE (27:1–8)<div class="tab-enin">Leviticus 27 opens with instructions concerning the fulfillment of vows. There is evidence that at certain periods vows could be fulfilled at any sanctuary. In I Samuel 1–2, Hannah appeals to God at the sanctuary at Shiloh, and that is where she brings her son Samuel for the vowed service. However, at some point the priesthood set limitations regarding whose vows were binding, what one could promise, and where payment could be made. Often these regulations limited the ability of women to make and keep vows. According to Numbers 30:10, vows made by independent women, whether divorcées or widows, are binding. However, the vow of a woman who is under a male’s authority can be annulled by that father or husband upon first hearing of it (Numbers 30:4–9; see further at Numbers 30:2–17). The centralization of worship further limited the ability of women to partake fully in this form of religious devotion by restricting the payment of vows to a central location (Deuteronomy 12:5–6, 11, 17, and 26).
</div><div class="tab-enin">Leviticus 27 lists fixed monetary equivalents for pledges to the sanctuary according to age and gender. Noteworthy is the lower value assigned to females in each age group. Carol Meyers suggests that the Leviticus valuation may accurately reflect the relative potential for economic productivity of each gender at various stages of life (see below) and does not reflect a notion that men are inherently more valuable than women. A high mortality rate is also no doubt a factor. Carol Meyers reports that skeletal remains in some ancient tombs help to determine mortality rates among different age and gender groups in ancient Israel. These remains indicate that the death rate was highest among the pre-adult population. In one tomb group, for example, nearly half the population did not survive to the age of 18 (“The Roots of Restriction: Women in Early Israel,” 1978, p. 95).
</div></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:2"><b>When anyone explicitly vows to יהוה</b>. The practice of vowing the value of a person to the sanctuary presumably has its roots in the earlier practice of dedicating people for lifelong service to the sanctuary (such as the vow made by Hannah in I Samuel 1:1–11). The monetary value in Leviticus 27 represents the amount of money that a vowed person’s service to the sanctuary would be worth. Thus, instead of using the services of the vowed person, the priests can use the money, presumably for the maintenance of the sanctuary. The option of dedicating materials to the sanctuary not only seeks to fill a vower’s personal need but also provides resources for maintaining the national sanctuary—including its personnel, especially priests (see also Numbers 6:2–21 and 30:3–15).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:3"><b>If it is a male from twenty to sixty.</b> There is some biblical evidence that men, at least, were considered to be most productive between twenty to sixty years of age. The book of Numbers legislates military conscription at twenty (Numbers 1:3) and service in the Tabernacle to between twenty and fifty (4:3, 23).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:4"><b>if it is a female.</b> The calculated 30 shekels for a woman in this category, when compared with 50 shekels for the male, places the woman’s relative economic worth in this age category at 38% of the total contribution of both genders. As Meyers notes, sociological studies show that when women contribute 40% to the economy’s productive labor, their status is at its highest. Their status diminishes if their contribution is higher (“Procreation, Production, and Protection: Male-Female Balance in Early Israel,” 1983, pp. 569–93, especially p. 575). See further Another View.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:5"><b>If the age is from five years to twenty.</b> The relative valuation of females in comparison with males is lowest in the five to twenty age group (for the female, 33% of the total contribution of both genders). Meyers observes that this period coincides with peak childbearing years, when women, occupied with childbearing and childrearing, could not provide as much in the way of other economic productivity. In addition, the fact that many women died in childbirth would also explain a devaluation of women’s economic worth relative to men in this age group.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:6"><b>If the age is from one month to five years.</b> A child could not be dedicated before it was one month old, most likely reflecting a high newborn mortality rate. This also accounts for the relatively low monetary value. Only at one month was a child considered viable and more likely to survive.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:7"><b>If the age is sixty years or over.</b> The woman’s relative economic worth is highest in the over sixty category (40% of the total contribution of both genders), when male efficiency declines, while females are able to continue their domestic responsibilities with only a minimal decrease in productivity (“Procreation, Production, and Protection,” pp. 584–93).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:8"><b>But if one cannot afford the equivalent.</b> This flexibility allows poor people who wish to make dedications of this kind to the sanctuary even if they cannot afford the listed amounts. The sacrificial system incorporates similar concessions to the poor (see 12:6–8).</div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.9-13" ref="27:9">VOTARY PLEDGES OF ANIMALS (27:9–13)<br></br>The next section concerns two categories of animal offerings: those that are fit for sacrifice (vv. 9–10) and those that are not (vv. 11–13). Once a sacrificable animal is pledged, it must be brought in to fulfill the vow and cannot be replaced by another animal. However, a pledged animal that is unfit for sacrifice because it is ritually impure (see Leviticus 11 for a list of animals) is brought to the priest, who assigns it a value, for which the Tabernacle’s staff will sell it to raise money for the sanctuary. The owner can also choose to redeem the animal, for twenty percent more than the value assessed by the priest.<br></br>The ritually pure sacrificial animals that are vowed are eaten by the priests and their households (after certain parts are burned entirely as God’s portion). Leviticus 22:1–16 indicates who may partake of the priest’s portion of the sacred donations. Of special interest is the question of when a priest’s daughter is entitled to part of her father’s share. Verses 12–13 of that passage determine that she is entitled to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations so long as she is part of his household. If she marries a member of the priesthood, her entitlement then derives from her husband. If she marries outside the priesthood, she becomes part of the lay community and thus loses her entitlement to partake of the sacred donations. However, if she is then widowed or divorced without children, and thus has no claim to her husband’s estate, she can go back to her father’s household and regain her entitlement to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head" id="levi_vv.14-25" ref="27:14">CONSECRATIONS OF PROPERTY (27:14–25)<br></br>This section treats three types of property pledges: dwellings (vv. 14–15), personal land holdings (vv. 16–20), and acquired land (vv. 22–25). Personal landholdings, that is, parcels of farmland, are assessed at a fixed rate according to how much seed it takes to plant them, which probably measures their size rather than how much the land has produced. The assessed value also depends on the timing of the jubilee (see 25:29–34), decreasing every year as the jubilee approaches. Several biblical texts mention women’s holding land, including Zelophehad’s daughters, Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah (see at Numbers 27:1–11 and 36:1–12); the wealthy woman from Shunem (II Kings 4:8–37 and 8:1–6); Achsah, whose father apparently gave her land as a dowry (Joshua 15:16–19 = Judges 1:12–15); and Naomi (Ruth 4:3–11), who is selling her dead husband’s land, which seems to indicate that under certain circumstances widows could inherit and sell their husband’s property. Presumably a female landholder could consecrate land to the sanctuary.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:14"><b>consecrates.</b> The verbal root is <i>k-d-sh</i> (“holy” or “set apart”). Here the verb means dedicating something to God, thus making it holy.<br></br><i><b>house.</b></i> This probably refers to urban dwellings, for houses located elsewhere are subject to being returned to their owner in the jubilee year (see 25:29–31).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.26-27" ref="27:26">FIRSTLINGS (27:26–27)<br></br>The Torah’s legislation views all firstlings as automatically consecrated to God; their owners cannot dedicate them to the sanctuary, since they are already God’s property (see, for example, Exodus 13:2). Animals that are not fit for sacrifice can be redeemed by the owner. Otherwise, the sanctuary may sell them as a source of income.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.28-29" ref="27:28">PROSCRIPTIONS (27:28–29)<br></br>While most references to <i>cherem</i> (proscription) in the Bible deal with the proscription of Israel’s enemies and their property at times of war (for example, Numbers 21:2–3), Leviticus 27 seems to be addressing cases within the Israelite community. Proscribed property becomes the permanent property of the sanctuary.<br></br>These verses seem to presume a distinction between two types of persons. Verse 28 treats non-Israelite slaves who are proscribed as part of an owner’s property and then become the permanent property of the sanctuary. Verse 29 applies to individuals whom some authorized communal body (probably a court) has proscribed, and who are thus under a death sentence.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:28"><b>totally consecrated.</b> Heb. <i>kodesh kodashim.</i> Objects permanently dedicated to God have the status of most holy; they are immutably sacred.</div><div class="head2" id="levi_vv.30-33" ref="27:30">TITHES (27:30–33)<br></br>These laws about two categories of tithes, agricultural and livestock, diverge from other biblical sources on tithes (see, for example, Numbers 18:21–24). As such, this section may represent either a very old tradition or a radical attempt at reform.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="27:33"> The tenth animal, whatever its condition, is designated for the tithe.

Leviticus concludes by claiming that God gave these commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai. That is, even the material that seems to be appended has its origin in the original revelation and is essential to the covenant at Sinai.<br></br><i></i><br></br><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg_296.jpg"/><br></br> </div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="right1"></div><div class="image1"></div><div style="page-break-before:always;"></div></div><div class="chap" id="ano33-1"><div class="tab-en"> T<small>HE CONCLUDING UNIT</small> of Leviticus concerns the economic support base, in the form of vowed resources, for ancient Israel’s central shrine. The first set of such votary pledges, Leviticus 27:2–8, involves the equivalence in silver of persons according to categories of gender and age, with separate assessments listed for females and males in four age groups. Because of the greater monetary values assigned to males in each age category, scholars have sometimes understood this table of valuations as an expression of gender bias, with females considered inherently less valuable than males.
</div><div class="tab-enin">However, many commentators now understand that this table relates mainly to labor potential rather than to intrinsic worth. The highest monetary values appear for persons of ages twenty to sixty; such people would be considered mature adults, given the fact that biblical census texts list males of age twenty and above (namely, those who might be conscripted into military service; see Numbers 1:3). That the youngest age category is that of one- to five-year-olds can be explained by presuming that ancient Israel was like many premodern agrarian societies in expecting children of very young ages to perform simple household tasks. Perhaps because of average differences in physical strength, women or girls were deemed to have a lower productive capacity than males of the same age, and thus Leviticus 27 assigns them a somewhat lower valuation in all categories.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The differential shekel values attached to females and males provide an insight into the labor patterns in Israelite households and the associated status of women. The best way to view the table is to sum the value of the two genders in each age bracket, thus obtaining the combined labor value of a female-male pair of workers in each category; then we can compare the contribution of each gender to this total amount. Except for the five to twenty category, in which childbearing (presumably beginning at puberty) might reduce the labor potential of females, the female percentage of that combined female-male amount is at or near 40 percent. Social scientists who study the relative contributions of women and men to household labor in various cultures have noted that a 2:3 female-to-male ratio, with women supplying 40 percent of the subsistence labor, correlates with the maximum prestige for women. Thus the table of valuations in Leviticus 27 is hardly a reflection of female inferiority but rather provides evidence of a positive estimation of women.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano33-2"><div class="tab-en"> <i><b>When anyone explicitly vows to</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> (27:2). The Hebrew noun translated here as “anyone” is <i>ish,</i> which in some contexts refers only to males. This verse’s formulation contrasts with the nazirite vow in Numbers 6:2 and with the general vows and oaths in Numbers 30:3–4, which both specify also the female counterpart noun, <i>ishah,</i> as a potential oath taker (see commentaries there). Nonetheless, the Rabbis (Mishnah <i>Arachin</i> 1:1) explicate that both men and women can make the type of vow presumed by this biblical unit, implying that <i>ish</i> as used here is to be read inclusively.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In several different places, Mishnah <i>Arachin</i> records the names of women who made vows of various kinds, mostly related to their children. In the current context, it mentions the mother of a girl by the name of Yirmatia (or Domitia in a manuscript version) who vowed her daughter’s weight, although it is unclear to what purpose (5:1). Elsewhere in the Mishnah, Helena—the queen of Adiabene, a convert to Judaism who is also mentioned by the 1st-century-<small>C.E.</small> historian Josephus—is said to have vowed to become a nazirite for seven years if her son returned “in safety from the war” (Mishnah <i>Nazir</i> 3:6). Also a certain Miriam of Palmyra brings offerings to fulfill a vow related to her dying daughter (<i>Nazir</i> 6:11). Josephus further mentions that his contemporary Berenice—sister of the Jewish Herodian ruler Agrippa II, and lover of Titus (the Roman general and later emperor)—made a vow of abstention.

</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Nonetheless, even though women appear prominently as autonomous oath takers in rabbinic aggadic literature, halachically a woman’s oaths were subject to a father’s or husband’s annulment, much as specified already in biblical law (Numbers 30:4–17). Only widows, divorcées, or unmarried women above the age of 12½ could make vows as freely as any adult male.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><b><i>the equivalent for a human being</i></b> (27:2). Although the vows of dedication to the Temple lost their relevance after its destruction in 70 <small>C.E.</small>, the Rabbis developed the regulations outlined in Leviticus 27 into a special mishnaic tractate called <i>Arachin</i> (Valuations), derived from the biblical word translated here as “equivalent” (<i>erech).</i> Indeed, the subject of vows and oaths occupied the Rabbis greatly as they set about organizing their formulation of Jewish law. Indeed, the Mishnah devoted three additional tractates to this topic—<i>N’darim</i> (Vows), <i>Nazir</i> (Nazirite), and <i>Sh’vuot</i> (Oaths)—all of which received extensive talmudic discussion. Perhaps this indicates the popularity of oaths and vows as an expression of religiosity, extending into rabbinic times. Other evidence of this propensity is found in the words of the 4th-century Christian leader John Chrysostom of Antioch and Constantinople, known for his anti-Jewish sermons, who chastised his audience for flocking to the synagogues to take oaths.
</div><div class="tab-enin"><b><i>if it is a female, the equivalent is thirty shekels</i></b> (27:4). The scale of fixed human value established here remains uncontested and unchanged in rabbinic tradition and does not receive much further commentary. The Rabbis devoted much more attention to regulating individualized vows such as vowing someone’s weight, or even the weight of a particular body part (Mishnah <i>Arachin</i> 5:1–2). Interestingly, the Rabbis take note that the Torah differentiates between the weight of male <i>(zachar)</i> and female (<i>n’kevah</i>), and they therefore insist that this refers to those who are “definitely male” and “definitely female.” This is one of the many contexts in Jewish law where the Rabbis introduce the concept of indeterminable sexual identity, namely the hermaphrodite <i>(androginos)</i> and the nonsexed person (<i>tumtum</i>), only to exclude such people from the scale of human valuation. However, the Mishnah considers both the <i>androginos</i> and the <i>tumtum</i> fully human and therefore able to make vows of valuation on someone who is of unambiguous sexual identity <i>(Arachin</i> 1:1).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><b><i>If the age is from one month to five years, the equivalent for a male is five shekels of silver</i></b> (27:6). Numbers 18:15–16 likewise prescribe five shekels for the redemption of a month-old first-born son from the priest. Since this practice persisted in Jewish communities beyond Temple times (<i>pidyon haben</i>), the Rabbis in Mishnah <i>B’chorot</i> 8:7 attempted to determine the contemporary coinage that contained the equivalent amount of silver. The talmudic Rabbis emphasize that women are exempt from the commandment of redeeming the first-born son, just as they are not obligated to circumcise their infant sons (BT <i>Kiddushin</i> 29a).

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano33-3"><div class="tab-en"> T<small>HERE IS SOMETHING</small> profoundly unsettling about <i>B’chukotai.</i> It seems to posit a world that we know, empirically, does not exist. It claims that there is a direct correlation between our actions and the natural order of the universe. Leviticus 26:3–5 promises unambiguously: “If you follow My laws and faithfully observe My commandments, I will grant you rains in their season…you shall eat your fill of bread….” Verses 14–16 warn just as clearly: “But if you do not obey Me and do not observe all these commandments…I will wreak misery upon you….” The seeming system of reward and punishment that these biblical passages proclaim appears to contradict the troubling reality that we witness, in which good people suffer, and evil people often prosper.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Passages like these seem to provide justification for those who reject both faith and God. How often do we hear, in the face of personal trauma or tragedy, “I can no longer believe in God” or “I can’t believe in a God who would do this”? How are we to understand God’s threats and promises?
</div><div class="tab-enin">According to the biblical scholar Nehama Leibowitz, our ancestors regarded blessings and curses, such as those in <i>B’chukotai,</i> as forms of prayer: these are the things that people hoped for, even willed to happen, in their longing for a world in which justice would visibly prevail. Perhaps this parashah is telling us, in its own theological language, that there is a moral order to the universe that is intrinsically connected to the natural order of the universe—and that the two orders are mutually dependent. In these teachings, it is as if God gives humankind every opportunity to discern that human action is intrinsic, and essential, to the proper functioning of the cosmos. Over and over again, the Torah enjoins us to act, to do, and to be because we “were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt” (Deuteronomy 6:21), because we “know the feelings of the stranger” (Exodus 23:9), and through these experiences have been given the opportunity to glimpse this truth. This is why we were chosen to bear witness to God’s revelation that “I, your God יהוה, am holy” (Leviticus 19:2). We are created in God’s image and we, as God’s partners, were chosen for a sacred task. This is our heritage and our responsibility; this is what it means to complete the work of Creation. But what if we forget, neglect, or ignore our sacred task of following the commandments?
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">The catalogue of threats and promises is a biblical way to explain how intimate the connection of the natural realm of the universe is to the moral realm. The two realms do not function independently of each other. There is a moral order to the universe as surely as there is a more easily observable natural order of “rains in their season.”
</div><div class="tab-enin">And it is in the moral realm where God cannot function alone. God never could—and so kept looking for partners. What did we expect of a God who created the natural universe? That the moral dimension was an afterthought? Our sages believed it pre-existed. God did not neglect the moral realm. On the contrary, humankind did. God kept expecting humankind to behave morally and was constantly disappointed—with Adam, with Noah, with the generations after the Flood. Finally, God found Abraham, the person who engaged God as an equal on ethical ground: “Must not the Judge of all the earth do justly?” (Genesis 18:25), and the process of Revelation began.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The essential unity of all aspects of God’s Creation appears as well in Lurianic Kabbalah’s formulation of the universe. Isaac Luria’s theory of <i>Sh’virat Hakeilim</i> (Shattering of the Vessels) seeks to explain the brokenness of our world, and to advance the means to restore it to its original unity. For Luria in the 16th century, it was the great cosmic shattering that had brought about our exile from God and from God’s Creation. Luria not only understood the primordial unity of God’s intention but also yearned for a return to it. In God’s promise of “rains in their season [and presence] in your midst,” Luria could see the opportunity for humankind to repair the world, to release the sparks, to play a role in the restoration of the universe through the performance of mitzvot.
</div><div class="tab-enin">In Judaism, the mystic does not seek to transcend or deny the material world. Rather, the mystic’s goal is the objective of this Torah portion: to restore the world, materially and spiritually, to a “single divine reality.” As Lawrence Fine describes that goal in his study of Luria, <i>Physician of the Soul, Healer of the Cosmos</i> (2003), it is the “dream that collective human effort can mend a broken world.” This is the vision of <i>B’chukotai.</i>
</div><div class="tab-enin">In these final verses of the book of Leviticus, God describes—in the most tactile, physical, understandable terms possible—the relationship between God’s Creation and humankind’s responsibility. It is simultaneously bribe and promise, exhortation and encouragement. At the foundation of it all is the essential understanding of Torah: the physical and ethical dimensions of God’s Creation are wholly dependent upon each other, and we ignore that relationship at our peril. There is no quid pro quo for individuals in the world—God’s scheme is far grander and more subtle than that. The issue is not one of personal reward and punishment. It is the unity of God, the unity of the prophetic vision as rendered in the Reform liturgy: “On that day, all the world shall be One and God’s name shall be One” (Zechariah 14:9). It is the ultimate fulfillment of Torah—as expressed in Leviticus 26:46: “These are the laws, rules, and <i>torot</i> that יהוה established <i>beino uvein b’nei Yisrael</i> (in relationship with the Children of Israel).” This is the partnership that must one day bring about the fulfillment of our hopes, dreams, and strivings—the sparks released as heaven and earth, heart and mind and soul are united at last.
