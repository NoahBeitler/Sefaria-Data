<div class="chap1"><small>DEUTERONOMY 11:26–16:17
</small><i>Laws and Loyalty
</i><div class="tab-en">P<small>ARASHAT</small> R<small>’EIH</small> (“see”) introduces the legal collection that extends from Deuteronomy 12 to 26. Like the two other major biblical collections of legal material (the Book of the Covenant in Exodus 21–24 and the priestly legislation in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers), these laws are conceived of as part of the covenantal relationship between Israel and God, with responsibilities incumbent upon both parties. The legal collection here offers a unifying vision of Israel: it insists on absolute loyalty to the one God—and to God’s Chosen Place, the sole official shrine.
</div><div class="tab-enin">According to Deuteronomy 1:5, the location for the expounding of these laws is the land of Moab, east of the Jordan River, before Israel enters the land. This would be during the 2nd millennium <small>B.C.E.</small>, according to the implied chronology and the imagined “original” audience (see introduction to parashat D’varim). But historians believe that these laws were actually compiled in the 7th century <small>B.C.E.</small> or later, and that they comprise part of the “book of the <i>torah</i> (Teaching),” the phrase used in Deuteronomy to refer to the exhortations and laws in this book (not to the so-called Five Books of Moses). According to II Kings 22 (and II Chronicles 34:14–28), a reportedly similar “book of the <i>torah</i>” is discovered during the reign of King Josiah, in the midst of renovations of the Temple. The King orders his scribes to consult with the female prophet Huldah, who authenticates the scroll. Its laws represent a reform of earlier traditions and of existing practice. The book of Kings further reports that King Josiah implemented some of those reforms in about 622 <small>B.C.E.</small> (On the economic aspects of this “reform,” see at 12:2–3.)
</div><div class="tab-enin">The laws in this parashah (like those in the three portions that follow) contain various precepts designed to regulate activity in the Promised Land and to bind Israel to its God. The parashah includes rules about many aspects of life: the consumption of meat (12:15–28; 14:3–21; 15:21–23), avoidance of the local non-Israelite peoples’ worship practices (12:30–31; 13:6–18; 14:1–2), true and false prophecy (13:1–5), tithing (14:28), remission of debts (15:1–6), care for the needy (15:7–11), debt-slavery (15:12–17), dedication of first-born male animals (15:19–20), and the pilgrimage festivals (16:1–17).
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">While the legislation here applies to all Israel, several teachings at first glance seem to address only the presumably male heads of household (12:7–8, 12, 18; 13:7; 15:20; 16:11, 14). This raises the following questions: What about their wives, who are not mentioned? Furthermore, are all of these laws intended only for men and not for women? The answers are not always clear. However, some laws implicitly address everyone, such as those that regulate diet (14:3–21). Others explicitly include women, as when they are expected to attend festive celebrations at Israel’s official sanctuary (12:12, 18; 16:11, 14).
</div><div class="tab-enin">A powerful theme in <i>parashat R’eih,</i> alongside the prominent concern for the loyal worship of Israel’s God alone, is caring for the needy. It is possible that a concern for women’s welfare lies behind certain economic legislation to protect the vulnerable (see at 14:29), since women were often at risk in ancient Israelite society.

</div><div class="tab-en">The rules in <i>parashat R’eih</i> begin the extensive legal collection that continues through Deuteronomy 26. Most scholars agree that even though Deuteronomy presents this material as Moses’ teachings, these precepts were compiled hundreds of years later. Evidence indicates that the compilers of the laws in Deuteronomy were an eclectic group—including scribes, priests, prophets, and other intellectuals—who formulated a notion of Israel as a nation guided by God. What makes their work unique is the powerful, unified vision that serves as the basis for their editorial work. Their distinctive perspective includes the idea that all Israel—kings and commoners alike—are to be judged by the degree to which they adhere to the laws of Deuteronomy. In particular, the laws considerably limit the roles of the king and priests and redistribute power to broader segments of the Israelite community (see at 17:14–20 and 18:1–8).
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_12.1">INTRODUCTION (12:1)
</div><div class="tab-enin">This verse specifies that the laws that follow must be observed in the Promised Land.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_12.2-14">DEMAND FOR CENTRALIZATION OF SACRIFICE IN GOD’S CHOSEN PLACE (12:2–14)
</div><div class="tab-enin">The commands to destroy places where foreign gods are worshipped (vv. 2–3) and to worship by offering sacrifices to God only in one select location (vv. 4–14) express one of Deuteronomy’s distinctive features: establishing the legitimacy of only one central shrine (which scholars often refer to as Deuteronomy’s “centralization of the cult”). Although Deuteronomy does not name the location of the shrine, other books in the Bible make clear that the Chosen Place is Jerusalem.
</div> The Israelites are charged to destroy places of worship and ritual objects that are sacred to the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land of Canaan, in order to prevent Israel from straying from God. Many modem scholars have concluded that in reality, this regulation targeted village sanctuaries where Israel’s own deity was worshipped. Such sacred sites had been legitimate places of Israelite and Judean worship in the centuries before the centralization mandated in Deuteronomy. (Note, for example, Hannah’s visits to the shrine in Shiloh in I Samuel 1.) Conducting sacrifices only in Jerusalem would have been a boon for that city’s economy, strengthening the crown as it faced Assyrian imperialism, especially in the 7th century <small>B.C.E.</small></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:3"><b>altars…pillars…sacred posts…images.</b> Archeologists have discovered these objects at sacred sites throughout the land of Israel. Ritual objects like these were earlier used by Canaanites and then adopted by the Israelites, thus indicating the debt they owed to their predecessors in the Promised Land.<br></br><i><b>sacred posts.</b></i> Heb. <i>asherim</i> (plural of <i>asherah),</i> ritual objects probably related to the worship of the goddess Asherah. According to II Kings 23, King Josiah removed the <i>asherah</i> from numerous sites, including the Temple itself and the place where “the women wove coverings for <i>asherah”</i> (II Kings 23:7). (See further at 16:21 and at Exodus 34:13.)</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:5"><b>the site that your God יהוה will choose.</b> Deuteronomy does not mention either Jerusalem or the Temple by name, since Jerusalem was not Israelite and the Temple not yet built during the time of Moses in which Deuteronomy is set.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:7"><b>households.</b> Heb. <i>bayit</i> (literally “house”; plural, <i>batim)</i> here refers to the occupants of the household compound—the extended family, including slaves and other dependents. The inclusion of the household in feasting at the sanctuary suggests a venue in which women would play a role. Families would join together to experience the joy of partaking in a sacral meal in a sacred setting.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:12"><b>sons and daughters…male and female slaves.</b> The specific mention of those with least access to resources is an important component of the laws in Deuteronomy. Free Israelite women are conspicuous by their absence from the list, which suggests that they were already included in the masculine plural command to rejoice before God (see also at 16:11 and Another View). The verse does not specify whether “slaves” refers to indentured servants, chattel slaves, or both; see further at 15:12–18; Exodus 21:2–11; Leviticus 25:35–54.<br></br><i><b>Levite.</b></i> According to Numbers 8, men from the tribe of Levi were not to receive land, but they were dedicated uniquely to God’s service. A distinctive feature of Deuteronomy is that it adds Levites—and implicitly their families—to the list of those who need special consideration or protection (see at v. 19, below), a likely result of closing the local sanctuaries that were a major source of livelihood for Levites.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:15"><div class="head2" id="deu_12.15-28">RULES ABOUT THE CONSUMPTION OF MEAT AND TITHES (12:15–28)<br></br>For Israelites as for others in the ancient world, meat-eating was not part of the daily diet, since they valued animals most for what they could produce while they were alive, including milk, wool, dung (used for fuel and construction), and offspring. Also, meat from an entire animal would have to be consumed at once, given the lack of refrigeration. Thus, eating the meat not otherwise utilized for sacrifice in festive meals provided one way for people to partake of meat. Exodus 20:21 implies that sacrifices could take place anywhere; however, if centralization of sacrifice meant that there were no longer any local sanctuaries at which to sacrifice animals, then how would those who lived far from Jerusalem be able to eat meat? In order to ensure that the consumption of meat did not cease with the cessation of village sacrifice, Deuteronomy allows Israelites to slaughter and eat meat in their own settlements, as long as they follow these detailed regulations. Deuteronomy’s laws in this case conflict with Leviticus 17:2–7, which permits eating meat only at a sanctuary.
</div><b>The impure and the pure alike may partake of it.</b> When animals for human consumption are no longer dedicated to God, everyone can partake of them, not only those who are ritually pure. This regulation makes it easier for women to consume meat because ritual impurity on account of menstruation and childbirth (see Leviticus 12; 15:19–30) no longer bars their participation.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:16"><b>you must not partake of the blood.</b> Eating blood is prohibited because blood symbolizes life—and life belongs to God (see Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:11)</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="12:17–18" ref="12:17"> Common among other peoples in the ancient Near East, tithes were a kind of assessment that could be fulfilled by designating agricultural products or livestock, which would be consumed in sacred ceremonies (see also at 14:22–29). This passage establishes that tithes are no longer to be consumed within the towns or villages of Israel; rather, they are to be joyfully shared by all members of the community, female and male alike, at God’s Chosen Place.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:18"><b>you.</b> In the singular; on who is being addressed, see at v. 12.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:19"> The centralization of sacrifice means that the landless Levites (see Numbers 8) who served local sanctuaries would have lost their means of livelihood. In an agrarian culture such as ancient Israel, those who did not own land were at risk of chronic starvation and even death. Therefore, the Levites would have become part of Israel’s underclass, unable to provide for themselves and their families.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="12:31"><div class="head2" id="deu_12.29-31">WARNINGS AGAINST WORSHIPPING AS OTHER NATIONS DO (12:29–31)<br></br>The crucial injunction condemning the worship of any deity other than Israel’s God is predicated upon the settlement of the land, after God will “cut down” the existing inhabitants. Certain biblical depictions of the conquest of the land (found especially in Joshua and Judges) claim that such destruction happened, whereas other passages portray a long period of Israelite coexistence with Canaanite and other ethnic communities in the very heartland of what would later become the Israel of the Monarchy. The results of decades of archeological research indicate that the latter version is the historically accurate one (see also at 2:34; 7:1–5, 24; 31:16).
</div><b>offer up their sons and daughters in fire.</b> While child sacrifice is condemned here as an abhorrent religious ritual, other passages reveal that at times even Israelites sacrificed their children (as implied by Genesis 22:1–19). According to II Kings 3:27, the Moabite king sacrifices his first-born son as a last resort. The Israelite child most renowned for having been sacrificed is Jephthah’s daughter (Judges 11:29–40).</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="13:2"><div class="head2" id="deu_13.1-19">WARNINGS AGAINST FALSE PROPHETS OR DIVINERS (13:1–19)<br></br>This section warns against three capital offenses that might lead Israelites astray from absolute and exclusive allegiance to Israel’s God.
</div><b>prophet.</b> The first situation involves what we might call “religious professionals,” beginning with prophets. The problem of false prophecy was important because people needed to know which individuals truly spoke for God (see at 18:9–22). The <i>Tanach</i> includes stories about four female prophets: Miriam (Exodus 15), Deborah (Judges 4–5), Huldah (II Kings 22:14–20), and Noadiah (Nehemiah 6:14), as well as several unnamed female prophets (Isaiah 8:3; Ezekiel 13:17; Joel 3:1). Nehemiah, the governor of Judah in the 5th century <small>B.C.E.</small>, implies that Noadiah is a false prophet. (On women prophets, see at 18:15 and <i>V’zot Hab’rachah,</i> Another View.)<br></br><i><b>dream-diviner.</b></i> Ancient peoples believed that their deities sometimes communicated through signs and dreams if properly interpreted by skilled practitioners. Deuteronomy considers any such practices illegitimate and dangerous; but compare Genesis 40–41, where Joseph interprets dreams without condemnation.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="13:7–12" ref="13:7"> The second case underscores the danger of false worship by prescribing the death penalty for all those—even family members and close friends—who entice someone to secretly worship deities other than Israel’s God. Wives and daughters are mentioned alongside brothers and sons as people who might entice one to false worship.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="13:7"><b>wife of your bosom.</b> This phrase suggests the physical and emotional intimacy of the marital relationship. As it does so, it highlights the grievousness of the transgression and the mandated punishment. Even a loving wife who attempts to lead her husband astray must be stoned to death, with her husband the first person to throw the stone.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="13:13–19" ref="13:13"> The third example moves from the personal to the general, as disloyalty to God condemns an entire town to death.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="14:3–8" ref="14:3"><div class="head2" id="deu_14.1-2">WARNINGS AGAINST ILLICIT MOURNING PRACTICES (14:1–2)<br></br>Gashing the skin until it bleeds and shaving were mourning customs practiced by Israelites and some of their neighbors. The other biblical passages that mention gashing or shaving have the connotation of foreignness, even when done by Israelites. For instance, I Kings 18:28 portrays Baal’s prophets mourning their god’s absence in their time of need by gashing themselves (see also Jeremiah 16:6–7; 41:4–5; 47:5). The textual evidence is ambiguous as to whether women as well as men engaged in these public mourning rituals; yet we do know that certain women were trained to chant dirges that accompanied burial ceremonies (see Jeremiah 9:16–17 and <i>Chayei Sarah,</i> Contemporary Reflection). Furthermore, iconographic evidence recovered by archeologists depicts women tearing their hair and beating their breasts as signs of mourning.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_14.3-21">DIETARY LAWS (14:3–21)<br></br>The dietary laws provide another venue in which Israel must demonstrate its allegiance to God. The regulations found here and in Leviticus 11 are straightforward: Israelites may consume only certain specified animals in order to remain within God’s holy community. However, the rationale behind these rules is less transparent. Rabbis, biblical scholars, archeologists, and anthropologists have tried to go beyond the arcane lists of permitted and prohibited animals to understand the purpose for these regulations. While explanations vary, most agree that dietary laws, whatever their origins, were eventually meant to distinguish Israel from other nations and to allow them to demonstrate their loyalty to God. Whether all Israelites were aware of and adhered to the dietary laws is uncertain. However, the absence of pig bones at Israelite sites suggests obedience to at least that rule.<br></br>The degree to which dietary rules had an impact on women’s lives is unclear. Both women and men worked in the fields, orchards, and gardens—the source of most Israelite food; and both genders tended livestock, while hunting was done mostly by men. [Food preparation was most often a woman’s task, but the dietary laws do not directly concern that issue. Rather, they concern which animals are permitted and which are forbidden, and they also ban the consumption of blood. The responsibility for draining blood likely fell to those individuals, female or male, who slaughtered animals. Some scholars believe that slaughtering and butchering were men’s tasks; but the narrative of the medium at En-dor reports that she slaughters a calf (I Samuel 28:24), perhaps indicating that both genders would have had responsibility for adhering to the dietary stipulations.—<i>Ed.</i>] (For more on the dietary laws and women’s role in food preparation, see at Leviticus 11:1–46.)
</div> These verses allow for the consumption of ruminants with cleft hooves. Such mammals include domestic livestock (sheep, goats, and cattle), those animals most accessible to the average Israelite.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="14:7"><b>they are impure for you.</b> The use of the word “impure” (repeated in vv. 8, 10, 19) suggests that dietary laws have a spiritual component and should not be understood as deriving from concerns for health, taste, or aesthetics. (For a different perspective, see at Leviticus 11:1–46.)</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="14:9–10" ref="14:9"> For more on the restriction of consuming seafood only with scales and fins, see at Leviticus 11:9.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="14:11–18" ref="14:11"> The list of forbidden birds focuses upon birds of prey. Since the carrion they eat contains blood, eating birds of prey would place Israelites in danger of consuming this prohibited substance.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="14:19–20" ref="14:19"> In general, winged insects that swarm are forbidden as food; but some (a particular type of locust, as well as crickets and grasshoppers) are permitted (Leviticus 11:20–23).</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="14:21"> This verse adds two other food regulations.<br></br><i><b>anything that has died a natural death.</b></i> Presumably such animals are prohibited as food for Israelites because they were not slaughtered and then drained of all their blood. In addition, contact with dead animals was a source of ritual contamination that removed people from God’s holy community.<br></br><i><b>you are a people consecrated</b></i> According to Deuteronomy, Israelites are God’s holy people (see also at Leviticus 19:2); consequently, they must preserve that holiness in their daily lives.<br></br><i><b>You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.</b></i> The implications and reasons for the injunction against boiling a baby goat in its mother’s milk are obscure. Scholars have not found parallels in other ancient Near Eastern legal material. While some see this as a polemic against a pagan rite, most likely this rule attests to biblical respect for the relationship between a mother and her offspring (see 22:6–7), as well as revulsion at the idea that mothers’ milk could contribute to death rather than life. [Some contemporary scholars offer a different explanation, arguing that the consonants in the noun <i>chalav</i> (milk) can be read as <i>chelev</i> (fat); in that case, the verse would forbid cooking a young animal in “its mother’s fat.” This prohibition would avoid the economic loss involved in slaughtering two animals, one of whom could still bear more young. (See Carol Meyers’ discussion of Jack Sasson’s research in <i>Exodus,</i> 2005, p. 203.)—<i>Ed.</i>]</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="14:24–26" ref="14:24"><div class="head2" id="deu_14.22-29">TITHING REGULATIONS (14:22–29)<br></br>Like the dietary laws, obedience to the laws of tithing is considered another requisite for inclusion in God’s holy community. Tithing is a type of taxation system, whereby a tenth of what one produced in the fields, vines, and orchards, together with the firstlings of one’s herds, is to be consecrated to God. In Deuteronomy the injunction applies to the entire household, women and men alike, who are to rejoice together in God’s presence as they consume these tithes at the central sanctuary. (See also Leviticus 27:30–33 and Numbers 18:21–32.)
</div> The stipulation allowing for money to be substituted for agricultural products or animals acknowledges the logistic difficulties encountered when traveling long distances burdened by heavy loads. As seen here and in rules regarding the consumption of meat (12:15–28), Deuteronomy seeks to address the hardships created by centralization of sacrifice, particularly for those living far from Jerusalem. This legislation strives to institute practices that will make it feasible for everyone to participate in the sacred life of the community.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="14:25"><b>money.</b> Literally, “silver.” Ancient Israel had no official currency system; rather, farmers exchanged standard quantities of grains, produce, and the like for fixed weights of silver. This silver might be in the form of jewelry, cast into ingots, or cut into pieces. Such currency would be easy to carry and could be exchanged for the requisite food and drink in the Chosen Place.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="14:27–29" ref="14:27"> In the third and sixth years of the seven year sabbatical cycle, Israelites are to give the tithe of their harvest to the needy in their own community, rather than consume it in the Chosen Place of worship.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="14:29"><b>the [family of the] Levite.</b> See at 12:19.<br></br><i><b>the fatherless, and the widow.</b></i> These two individuals lacked the protection of an adult male. Note that the Torah does not offer a systematic way to integrate them into alternate family settings so that they could be cared for and protected by clan elders; neither are they given resources that would enable them to fend for themselves. Rather, like the Levites and like strangers living within Israel’s borders, they are placed at the mercy of others who are charged with the responsibility to provide for them.

However, whereas Leviticus 25 prescribes release regulations for a fifty-year cycle, Deuteronomy requires a seven-year adjustment.
</div><div class="head2a" id="deu_15.1-11"><i>Remission of Debt</i> (15:1–11)<br></br>This passage articulates the ideal that there will be no needy requiring loans or other forms of assistance, since obeying God’s teachings will bring blessing and avert poverty.

</div> Deuteronomy repeatedly makes the point that plenty and well-being come not from hard work or good fortune but rather from God, who blesses those who follow God’s instruction.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="15:4"><b>hereditary portion.</b> In the Bible, the land is Israel’s inheritance, promised by God to Israel’s ancestors. Although women share in the blessing of its bounty, they generally do not seem to inherit land—the basis for survival. The Bible mentions several cases of women able to inherit land, such as Zelophehad’s daughters (see at Numbers 27:1–11 and 36:1–12), the woman of Shunem (II Kings 4), and Job’s daughters (Job 42:13–15); but these appear to be exceptions. See further at Numbers 36:11.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="15:7–11" ref="15:7"> This passage enjoins Israelites to lend to their kin with a generous spirit even if they risk losing what they loaned in the seventh-year remission of debt.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" ref="15:12"><div class="head2a" id="deu_15.12-18"><i>Release of Debt-Servants</i> (15:12–18)<br></br>This passage concerns the Israelite woman or man who becomes a servant as a consequence of financial problems or to fulfill a court judgment. The institution of indentured servitude was common throughout the ancient Near East.<br></br>Israelites risked becoming debt-servants when they could not repay loans, pay taxes, or meet other financial obligations. They might be forced to sell themselves or their children into debt-servitude in order to forestall financial ruin or starvation. Children could also become debt-servants after having been pledged as security on a loan that the parents were unable to repay. Because of the six-year limit on the term of servitude, the Hebrew debt-servant is in a position different from that of the foreigner taken as a prisoner of war or purchased from a foreign owner and kept as a slave for life. The Torah regulates the treatment of slaves and forbids the worst of abuses. (See also at Exodus 21:2—11 and Leviticus 25:39–54.)
</div><b>Hebrew man—or woman.</b> Women were more likely to be sold into servitude on account of the debts of their fathers or husbands, rather than because of debts they themselves incurred. Exodus 21:7–11 provides special rules for the daughter sold into servitude by her parents. In that case, the woman would have been treated as a wife for one of the men in the household; therefore, marital law applied to her, and she would not be expected to leave the household.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="15:17"><b>Do the same with your female slave.</b> Here, in contrast to Exodus 21:7–11, male and female servants are treated equally.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="15:18"><b>do not feel aggrieved.</b> As in vv. 9–10, the text anticipates the understandable reluctance by some individuals to follow these laws and offers reassurance.</div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin"></div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="16:1–8" ref="16:1"><div class="head2" id="deu_15.19-23">LAWS ABOUT THE DEDICATION OF FIRST-BORN MALE LIVESTOCK (15:19–23)<br></br>This section establishes that a family must sacrifice and consume unblemished firstlings annually in the Chosen Place (see also 12:17–18; 14:22–29). Similar legislation in Exodus 13:11–15, Leviticus 27:26–27, and Numbers 18:15 designates the firstlings instead for the priests.
</div><div class="head2" id="deu_16.1-17">LAWS ABOUT THE PILGRIMAGE FESTIVALS (16:1–17)<br></br>These rules for the observance of the three major festivals account for the fact that Israelites are now to celebrate in the Chosen Place, rather than in their own local communities.
</div> The Passover (Pesach) celebration commemorates God’s freeing Israel from Egypt. The highlight of the pilgrimage to God’s Chosen Place is the sacrifice and consumption of a domesticated animal, with unleavened bread eaten for the duration of the weeklong festival; a solemn gathering is to be held on the last day. Whereas other Passover regulations envision Israelites eating the sacrifice in their homes (see Exodus 12:46), Deuteronomy permits it only in the central sanctuary, a stipulation that creates additional problems that the laws try to resolve. The language of the regulations uses male singular pronouns; but as 12:12 makes clear, women are expected to share in sacral meals. The problem for most women and many men would have been the distance to the Chosen Place.</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="16:9–12" ref="16:9"> The Feast of Weeks (that is, Shavuot) comes seven weeks after the beginning of the spring harvest. It, too, requires pilgrimage to the Chosen Place and is highlighted by a freewill offering that reflects the extent of God’s blessing. As is typical of Deuteronomy, the joyous celebration is to be shared by a broad section of society.</div><div class="tab-enin" ref="16:11"> The entire household, including the stranger, fatherless, and widow, is included in the injunction to rejoice before God. Although the Israelite wife is not specifically mentioned, the inclusion of daughters, female slaves, and widows suggests that wives were included as well as a matter of fact. (See further at 12:12 and Another View.)</div><div class="tab-enin" orig_ref="16:13–15" ref="16:13"> The Feast of Booths (Sukkot) also is to be celebrated with the entire community, including all female and male family members and the marginalized elements of society.

Each feast requires the offering of a gift, which reflects the blessing that God has bestowed upon the individual making the offering. Who is required to appear before God and bring a gift reflecting God’s blessing? “All your males” (v. 16) are the ones who must see God’s “face.” [What this rule is meant to convey about females is not clear, especially given that 12:12 and other passages expect women to be present during festival celebrations as well. Assessing the relationship between obligations and exemptions is difficult.

Yet the wording of several instructions raises at least two questions about the inclusion of women.
</div><div class="tab-enin">First, daughters and female slaves are commanded to celebrate two of the pilgrimage festivals—Shavuot (16:11) and Sukkot (16:14), but not Passover (16:5–8)—along with marginal individuals like widows and orphans. (See also 12:12.) But why are wives not mentioned? The command addressed to the head of household apparently includes the man’s wife as the senior female of the household; the head of the household, when male, thus stands for both members of the conjugal pair (see also <i>Mishpatim,</i> Another View). This implicit inclusion of the wife perhaps authorizes her to act on behalf of her husband should he be unable for any reason to make the pilgrimage trip. In fact, listing her separately would have precluded her status as “second-in-command.”
</div><div class="tab-enin">The summary of the stipulations for the three pilgrim festivals presents a second problem, for it specifies that “all your males” shall come to the Chosen Place (16:16). Why are women not mentioned? Some have suggested that Deuteronomy exempts women because the journey might be too difficult for them, especially those with young children. But another possibility acknowledges that agrarian households included animals that could not be left untended for close to two weeks (the weeklong holiday plus travel time). As the chief household managers (see Proverbs 31:10–31), women were the natural ones to maintain the household at such times. Thus, the all-inclusive injunction for everyone to participate in the Sukkot festival every seventh year that is found elsewhere in Deuteronomy (31:10–12) may be idealistic. Alternatively, the insistence on women’s participation on that occasion may emphasize that they too should experience the special covenant renewal of the seventh-year celebration.

</div><div class="tab-enin">Twenty-first-century expectations for gender equality in the Torah are unrealistic. Because Israelite society was organized by lineage units, Deuteronomy addresses many of its instructions to the heads of households (usually male), who bear the main responsibility for fulfilling the Torah’s cultic requirements. Yet, although women often are not addressed explicitly in the pilgrimage regulations, they are not forbidden to participate; in fact, several texts indicate their presence. In this respect, the festival commands of Deuteronomy seem more inclusive than comparable rules in Exodus (compare Exodus 23:14–17).

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano47-2"><div class="tab-en"> <i><b>Together with your households, you shall feast there before your God</b></i> יהוה (12:7). The use of the phrase “your households” (literally “your houses”) immediately raises questions about who is included in this designation. Subsequent verses in this parashah (12:12, 18; 16:11, 14) consistently omit wives from lists of participating household members, but they do include other women, such as daughters and female slaves. Thus, early rabbinic interpreters considered the expression for “house” here to mean “wife” (<i>Sifrei D’varim</i> 64); in fact, rabbinic texts often equate the two terms (Mishnah <i>Yoma</i> 1:1). Rabbinic sources frequently cite a statement to this effect attributed to Rabbi Yosi, who said, “All my life I never called my wife ‘my wife’ <i>(ishti)</i> and my ox ‘my ox.’ Instead, my wife I called ‘my house’ and my ox ‘my field’” (BT <i>Shabbat</i> 118b; BT <i>Gittin</i> 52a, among others). Indeed, in talmudic Aramaic one of the words for “wife” is related to the word for “house.” Thus, the Rabbis understood a wife to be the essence of a household, and they attached a great deal of significance to this fundamental conviction.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">The metaphoric connection between woman and house in the rabbinic imagination led to further elaborations, such as references to the interior organs of the woman’s body as various rooms. For example, “the sages made a simile (<i>mashal mash’lu)</i> with regard to the woman: the chamber, the antechamber, and the upper chamber” (Mishnah <i>Niddah</i> 2:5). At times, women’s sexual organs are referred to as doors, hinges, and even keys (BT <i>B’chorot</i> 45a).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>You shall consecrate to your God</b></i> <b>יהוה</b> <i><b>all male firstlings</b></i> (15:19). The repeated biblical insistence that the first-born be consecrated led to an entire mishnaic tractate, <i>B’chorot,</i> which is devoted to the legal aspects of this topic. Among many other concerns, Mishnah <i>B’chorot</i> inquires as to what constitutes the status of a first-born animal. Does this include, for instance, an animal that emerged from “its mother’s side,” presumably by Caesarean birth? The answer is that such a birth does not bestow first-born status on the animal since Numbers 18:15 defines the first-born as literally what “opens the womb.” Moreover, biblical law explicitly requires a “male” first-born. Thus, any sexual ambiguity, whether a lack or a doubling of external sexual organs, constitutes a blemish that disqualifies an animal from sacrificial status as a first-born (Mishnah <i>B’chorot</i> 6:12).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>You shall rejoice in your festival</b></i> (16:14). According to the Babylonian Talmud, this verse teaches that a husband is obligated to make his wife and children rejoice as part of the holiday observance. A Babylonian sage suggests that wives are made joyous with new clothes; he goes on to claim that in Babylonia women prefer colorful garments, while women in the Land of Israel prefer bleached clothes made from linen (BT <i>P’sachim</i> 109a). Another rabbinic tradition based on this verse prohibits weddings during the intermediary days of Passover or Sukkot, since “one should not mix up one joy with another” (BT <i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 8b).
</div><div class="tab-enin"><i><b>Three times a year…all your males shall appear before your God</b></i> יהוה (16:16). The emphasis on “males” in the concluding verses of the parashah is noteworthy, especially since earlier statements imply that the entire extended household, including daughters and female slaves, was obligated to participate in festival observances. The exclusion of women in this verse appears to contradict the preceding passages. The Rabbis solved this contradiction by subdividing the responsibilities of rejoicing (v. 14) into various components. Accordingly, women and people with sexual ambiguities, such as the hermaphrodite and the non-sexed person, are said to be exempt from the commandment of appearing before God (Mishnah <i>Chagigah</i> 1:1), since the biblical verse specifies that males are to do this. “Appearance” (<i>r’iah</i>) entails both presence in the Temple and offering a sacrifice, since “they shall not appear before יהוה empty-handed” (16:16). Talmudic discussions (BT <i>Chagigah</i> 4b) suggest that the exemption of women from this particular obligation makes sense since bringing a sacrifice in this instance is a time-bound commandment (festival observances take place three times a year on specific days on the calendar). According to an early rabbinic principle, women are exempt from commandments that must be performed at fixed times (Mishnah <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7). However, the responsibility to rejoice applies to everyone (Tosefta <i>Chagigah</i> 1:4 and BT <i>Chagigah</i> 6b); thus, in that aspect of the festival celebration, women and men are equally obligated.

</div></div><div class="chap" id="ano47-3"><div class="tab-en"> “Y<small>OU ARE WHAT YOU EAT,”</small> the common expression goes. I sometimes think of this saying in relation to kashrut (that is, keeping kosher). What do the choices that we make about what we eat reveal about who we really are? Many Jews today view kashrut as an outdated vestige of ancient Israelite practice, expanded upon by rabbinic Judaism, but no longer relevant to modern day life. However, the presentation of the prohibitions associated with kashrut in <i>parashat R’eih</i> challenges us to consider anew the purposes of kashrut.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Deuteronomy 14 tells us what animals, fish, and birds we can and cannot eat. It instructs us not to boil a kid (a young goat) in its mother’s milk, an injunction that became the basis for the rabbinic separation between milk and meat (14:21; see also Exodus 23:19 and 34:26). While many Jews today believe the biblical prohibitions against certain meat and fish to be for health reasons, <i>parashat R’eih</i> makes no such claim. In fact, if this were the case, the explicit permission to give the stranger and the foreigner the foods we are forbidden to eat (14:21) would be frankly immoral. Rather, <i>parashat R’eih,</i> as the Torah does elsewhere, identifies the articulation of eating prohibitions strictly as part of the Israelites’ particular path to holiness: “for you are a people consecrated to your God יהוה” (14:21). What is it about these prohibitions that can make us holy? Interestingly, the prohibited foods are identified as <i>tamei…lachem</i>—ritually impure “for you” (14:7, 8, 10). For this reason, it is perfectly acceptable for other people to eat them, just not for the people Israel.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Traditional and modern commentators have offered various explanations as to why particular fish, poultry, and animals are considered <i>tahor</i> (“ritually pure”) and therefore acceptable to eat. But perhaps more important than the meaning of each of the details of the prohibitions is the simple fact that we are given a list of dos and don’ts that govern what we are to consume daily. According to the Torah, God asks that we abstain from eating certain foods, not because they are unhealthy or intrinsically problematic, but simply as an expression of our devotion. As with other <i>chukim</i> (laws that the rabbinic sages define as being without rational explanation), these prohibitions are like the requests of a beloved: we may not understand them, but we are, in essence, asked to follow them purely as an expression of our love. Daily, the observance of kashrut calls us back to a personal relationship with God.
</div><div class="tab-enin">The laws of kashrut offer a Jewish spiritual discipline that is rooted in the concrete choices and details of daily life—to be practiced in an area that seems most “mundane.” In fact, part of the beauty of kashrut is that regardless of our age, personal interests, or geographic location, we all eat, and most of us do so several times a day. While we may sometimes choose to dine alone, eating is almost universally enjoyed as a social activity. A spiritual discipline around eating is one that carries the clear message that spirituality is about far more than what we do in synagogue and on holidays; it extends into every area of our lives, every single day.
</div><div class="tab-enin">Kashrut reminds us again and again that Jewish spirituality is inseparable from what one might term “physical.” It teaches us that Jewish spiritual practice is about taking the most ordinary of experiences—in all aspects of our lives—and transforming them into moments of meaning, moments of connection. Kashrut provides a model for doing just that, around issues of food preparation and eating. It’s time to cook dinner: What will we make, and how will we prepare it? Will we be driven by an empty stomach or considerations that extend beyond it as well? In these moments, kashrut can connect us to Jewish tradition, to other Jews, and to God. We are hungry and sit down for a meal, but before digging in, we recall that Jewish tradition offers us the practice of pausing for a blessing and a moment of gratitude. We may take this a step further and decide to put aside <i>tzedakah</i> regularly at dinnertime, as some of us try to do. This can be seen as a practice similar to the tithing performed in ancient times, as outlined in the verses immediately following the rules of kashrut in our parashah (14:22–29). In stead of just wolfing down our food and moving on to the next activity, we can learn from Jewish rituals to pause and turn the act of eating into a moment of heightened spiritual awareness.
</div><div class="image"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
</div><div class="image0"><img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
</div><div class="tab-enin">Increasing numbers of Jews today are expanding their kashrut practice to incorporate additional ethical and environmental considerations. Was the food produced under conditions that respect persons and the environment? Were the workers who picked or prepared the food paid a living wage? Did the processes of production treat animals humanely? In addition to allowing these questions to influence our choices about what to eat, we can direct our <i>tzedakah</i> money to organizations that address these issues, like environmental and farmworker advocacy groups.
</div><div class="tab-enin">From the time of the Torah onward, Jewish tradition teaches us that the spiritual realm encompasses all of life. Kashrut and the other Jewish practices related to eating exemplify this teaching and extend beyond themselves: they stand as daily reminders to look for additional ways to turn the ordinary into moments of deeper connection and intentionality. Every moment has the potential to be one of connection. Through other <i>mitzvot,</i> such as the laws governing proper speech and interpersonal ethics, as well as through the less well-known but rich Jewish tradition of cultivating <i>middot</i> (personal qualities such as patience and generosity in judgment), we can seek to deepen our connections with each other and with God. A Jewish spiritual discipline around eating, practiced with intention, can set us on this course every day. “You are what you eat.” That is, what you choose to eat and how you choose to eat it says a lot about who you are and what kind of a life you are striving to achieve.
