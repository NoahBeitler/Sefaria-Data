   LEADERSHIP

  is challenged repeatedly throughout the book of Numbers (see, for example,
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
   Numbers 12
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_vv.14.1-45a">
   14
  </a>
  , and
  <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_21.1-22.1a">
   21
  </a>
  ). In this parashah, rebels challenge not only Moses’ guidance, but also Aaron’s religious authority. Scholars have long recognized that
  <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#num_16.1-35">
   Numbers 16
  </a>
  combines at least two stories of insurrection: Korah and his company challenge Aaron’s exclusive right to make ritual offerings to God; Dathan and Abiram question Moses’ abilities and authority. Each story has a separate focus and outcome; nevertheless, they share important features in common. Both of them turn on questions of the legitimacy of the current leadership, both demonstrate that the current leadership is divinely ordained, and both are resolved by divine wrath in a way in which the punishment fits the crime.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In these two episodes, the people fail to see that God—not Moses or Aaron—is the one responsible for electing the civil and religious authorities. When the challengers continue to speak against Moses and Aaron, God sends a plague (
  <a href="#num17-6">
   17:6–15
  </a>
  ). To demonstrate that Aaron’s post as chief priest is due to divine preference and not human election, God commands each of the tribes to present a staff at the Tabernacle (
  <a href="#num17-16">
   17:16–26
  </a>
  ). The miraculous fruit-bearing of only Aaron’s staff proves that God has chosen only the House of Aaron for the priesthood. The different duties, responsibilities, and restrictions associated with Levites and priests then are further specified and detailed at the end of the parashah (
  <a href="#num_18.1-32">
   18:1–32
  </a>
  ).

  Women do not play much of a role in

  with good reason: there is little place for women in a contest for either religious or political leadership. Aside from Miriam, Deborah (Judges 4–5), and Queen Athaliah (II Kings 11), there are hardly any female Israelite leaders recorded as such in the Bible. Miriam is a notable exception to the near absence of female leaders, for she is included in the inner circle of power along with Moses and Aaron. The prophet Micah (8th century
  <small>
   B.C.E.
  </small>
  ) reflects this view when he proclaims in God’s name, “I redeemed you from the house of bondage, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam” (Micah 6:4). Thus, the possibility of a female leader alongside male leaders certainly existed.

  It is true that, as Tikva Frymer-Kensky has noted, the book of Samuel depicts an
  <i>
   ishah
  </i>
  of special status who claimed the authority to represent her town in emergency negotiations with a hostile general who recognized her authority as a matter of course (II Samuel 20:15–22). Apparently it went without saying that she was an
  <a id="page_894">
  </a>
  elder, because that presumption best accounts for the city elders’ otherwise striking absence in the negotiations (compare Judges 8, 9, 11;
  <i>
   Reading the Women of the Bible,
  </i>
  2002, pp. 58–61). And Susan Ackerman has argued that it may have gone without saying that the role of queen mother was an acknowledged position of political and religious leadership
  <i>
   (Warrior, Dancer, Seductress, Queen,
  </i>
  1998, pp. 133–141). However, while female leadership may be occasionally discernible in Israelite historical memory, the Bible itself highlights very few women in leadership roles.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Even though the rebels’ wives are not involved in the uprising, they pay the price for their husbands’ actions, as the families of Dathan and Abiram also suffer the fate of God’s wrath. In contrast, the women related to Korah’s company are not punished for their challenge to the priesthood. Perhaps this is because women cannot serve as priests; hence, they may not have been present when their husbands offered incense to God. Unlike in
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
   Numbers 12
  </a>
  , where both Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses yet only Miriam bore the punishment, in
  <i>
   parashat Korach,
  </i>
  Dathan’s and Abiram’s families are included in the punishment for political insurrection. This suggests that the punishment would have served as a warning to any contender for power, female or male.

   The Rebellions

  </span>
  wo distinct groups, from two separate tribes, rise up together against Moses and Aaron. Moses addresses them in parallel fashion in two incidents that culminate in the destruction of each group. Because of the separate nature of the two rebellions and their ensuing punishments, scholars suspect that these were originally independent, unconnected stories. This theory is strengthened by
  <a href="49_chapter_46.xhtml#d11-6">
   Deuteronomy 11:6
  </a>
  , which refers to Dathan and Abiram without, however, mentioning Korah or any Levites.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Korah, a first cousin of Moses and Aaron (
  <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#E6-14">
   Exodus 6:18–21
  </a>
  ), and certain Levite representatives challenge Aaron’s exclusive right to the priesthood, whereas Dathan and Abiram question Moses’ leadership abilities. That incident resembles Miriam and Aaron’s challenge of Moses’ role as prophet (
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
   Numbers 12
  </a>
  ), though the contrast in God’s retaliation may suggest a leniency with respect to Miriam—and even more so, Aaron—in
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
   Numbers 12
  </a>
  . The Korah rebellion frames the separate confrontation by Dathan and Abiram, who challenge Moses.
 </div>
 <div class="head2" id="num_vv.1-11">
  KORAH’S CHALLENGE TO THE AARONITE PRIESTHOOD (16:1–11)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Korah’s challenge to the Aaronite priesthood can be explained by his own Levite lineage, which the narrator pointedly notes (
  <a href="#num_16.1-35">
   v. 1
  </a>
  ). Korah protests to Moses that all Levites should be considered holy enough for the priesthood. (In
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num8-5">
   8:5–22
  </a>
  , God had uniquely consecrated the Levites, providing some grounds for Korah’s presumption.)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  [When the daughters of Zelophehad (from the tribe of Manasseh) later confront the leadership, they find it politic to contrast their challenge with Korah’s rebellion. When they demand their father’s land, they cleverly distance their dead father from Korah by hastening to say: “Our father…was not one of the faction, Korah’s faction, which banded together against
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="ltr">

  </i>
  Korah is identified by his father, grandfather, and tribal affiliation. This partly accounts for his claim to the priesthood: he is Aaron’s patrilineal first cousin. But Dathan and Abiram’s rebellion against Mosaic leadership is not readily explicable by lineage. Perhaps Dathan and Abiram are simply representative of the general Israelite unhappiness with the wilderness experience and Moses’ leadership, an unhappiness that forms a theme throughout Exodus and Numbers.

  Later in the narrative, these chieftains who join the mutiny against Moses are connected with the Levites who challenge Aaron (

  This statement is the focus of Korah’s challenge to Aaron’s exclusive right to the priesthood, but the language is abstract enough that it works for Dathan and Abiram’s rebellion against Moses’ civic leadership as well. That they are two separate rebellions, with distinct foci, is evidenced instead from Moses’ different responses to each party. One thing that they share in common, however, is that they address their complaints about leadership choices to Moses.

   </a>
  </b>
  The rebels state that the entire congregation is holy because God dwells within it, and this appears to be consonant with priestly literature in which God promises to live in Israel’s midst (see
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e29-45">
   Exodus 29:45
  </a>
  ) and where the people are called to be holy (see
  <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
   Exodus 19:6
  </a>
  ). This ideal of a holy nation recurs throughout the priestly texts, including the ending of the previous story, which again calls Israel to be holy (
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num15-37">
   Numbers 15:40
  </a>
  ). But the challengers miss the point of these divine injunctions toward holiness: the congregation is not holy by virtue of God’s presence, but in fact they must maintain holiness in order to ensure God’s continued residence among them. Korah challenges the need for a priestly hierarchy if all are holy. The lesson to be derived from his fiery death is that the priestly hierarchy is necessary in order to maintain the congregation’s holiness.

  Literally, God “will bring him closer.” The verb
  <i>
   hikriv
  </i>
  (from the root
  <i>
   k-r-b)
  </i>
  means “to bring near” and is related to the noun for “sacrifice” (
  <i>
   korban
  </i>
  ). The priests possess a higher degree of holiness by virtue of their closeness to God. The test that Moses poses will separate those who are closest to God from the rest of the congregation.

  It was precisely a misuse of incense that had resulted in the deaths of Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu (
  <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_10.1-7">
   Leviticus 10:1–2
  </a>
  ). Korah is making a claim on the priesthood, so Moses challenges Korah to demonstrate that he can perform a priestly task. Moses’ test does not aim to show who can
  <i>
   best
  </i>
  perform priestly services for the community. Rather, it is designed to demonstrate that God is the one who has chosen Aaron for the priesthood.

  </i>
  General holiness is demanded of a congregation in which God dwells (
  <a href="#num_16.1-35">
   see at 16:3
  </a>
  ). Moses here refers to two higher levels of holiness. Above the general congregation is the additional holiness of the Levites (
  <i>

  </i>
  who are “close to” God (
  <i>
   k-r-b
  </i>
  again;
  <a href="#num16-5">
   see at v. 5
  </a>
  ) and can therefore minister on behalf of the congregation at the Tabernacle. The third and the highest level of holiness is demonstrated by the additional closeness to God enjoyed exclusively by Aaron and his descendants, the priests (
  <i>
   kohanim
  </i>
  ). Note that since only Aaron and his descendants are priests, Moses himself implicitly belongs among the Levites, like the rest of the house of Levi apart from his brother’s line.

  God is the one who elevated Aaron’s status beyond the other Levites; neither Aaron’s appointment as chief priest, nor the punishment that Korah receives for attempting to replace him, result from choices that Moses has made. By deferring judgment and punishment to God in the test-by-incense, Moses demonstrates that Korah’s complaint to Moses should have been addressed to God in the first place.

  DATHAN AND ABIRAM’S MUTINY AGAINST MOSAIC LEADERSHIP (16:12–15)

 <div class="tab-enin">
  Dathan and Abiram criticize Moses’ leadership, blaming him for the poor conditions of the people in the wilderness and accusing him of not fulfilling his promises to them of land and possessions. As with Korah, the accusations are misplaced. Moses is responsible for neither the wilderness situation nor the choice of Aaron as high priest. The second story of rebellion begins when Moses sends for Dathan and Abiram, but they refuse to come—complaining bitterly about Moses’ leadership of the people in the wilderness.

  This translation of Dathan and Abiram’s response does not convey the subtle irony inherent in the use of the verb

  The rebels’ sarcastic remarks invert Moses’ promises to bring the Israelites from Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey (

   Exodus 13:5

  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num14-6">

  Literally, “to kill us.” Dathan and Abiram imply that Moses aims to cause their deaths through the harsh conditions in the wilderness (see also
  <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-1">
   Exodus 16:3
  </a>
  ). Ironically, the reason for the delay in reaching the Promised Land is a similar protest in
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_vv.14.1-45a">
   Numbers 14
  </a>
  . There, when the people complained that God had brought them out of Egypt only to die in the wilderness (
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_vv.14.1-45a">

  </a>
  ), God threatened to destroy the entire congregation (
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num14-12">
   14:12

  ). Moses pleaded with God on their behalf, and God relented (

   Deuteronomy 24:16
  </a>
  , which states that children are not to suffer for their parents’ actions; in addition, Ezekiel 18:4 tells us that each person is responsible for his or her own crimes. But it seems from the current passage, and a parallel passage in Joshua 7:24, that this principle applies only to laws that do not concern sacred items or places. When there has been a violation of ritual law, anyone who comes into contact with the source of the offense is tainted by it, even to the third and fourth generations (
  <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-5">
   Exodus 20:5
  </a>
  ). Thus, the fact that the punishment is enacted against the entire household of each of the rebels further demonstrates that the offense is understood to be against God, and not against God’s human representatives—even though Korah, Dathan, and Abiram perceive themselves to be challenging only the authority of Moses and Aaron.

  Moses’ ability to dictate the terms of Dathan’s and Abiram’s deaths is interesting. His point is, “By this you shall know that it was
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">

  who sent me to do all these things; that they are not of my own devising” (v. 28). And yet, without prompting from God, Moses announces the terms of the rebels’ deaths, bringing about a sudden earthquake that swallows up Dathan, Abiram, and their families. To the onlooking Israelites, this presumably would have appeared to be a result of Moses’ own power; and perhaps that is intended to serve the purpose of quashing potential future challenges to his authority. In fact, however, it will have the opposite effect (

  <a href="#num17-5">
   17:5

  <a href="#num16-18">
   vv. 18–19

  , are consumed in the earthquake along with Dathan and Abiram. Reading the Hebrew closely, however, reveals the editor’s cleverness in tying together the different endings for each rebel group. In
  <a href="#num16-35">
   v. 35
  </a>
  we are told literally that “fire had gone forth” (a past perfect verb). According to the final, redacted version, the incident described in this verse, namely the burning of Korah’s incense-offering group, occurred before the earthquake swallowed them along with Dathan’s and Abiram’s households.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Thus, in vv. 18–19, Korah and his 250 companions attempted to offer incense with their fire pans at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. God’s immediate annihilation of them is described now in v. 35. Note that Moses does not act at all here. God’s Presence appears in view of the entire community (v. 19), and a fire issues forth directly from God to consume the offenders.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The difference in the enactment of each punishment highlights the difference between the two types of rebellion. The challenge to Moses’ leadership is punished by Moses with God’s backing. This pattern reflects the overarching model in which the leader—Moses, whom God has chosen—acts on God’s behalf and behest in order to take care of the people. Conversely, God handles the challenge to priestly authority directly.

  [This concluding message to the Levites assures them of their safety when they follow God’s instructions. This message is especially apt after the death of Korah, the rebellious Levite. —

   ORACH DESCRIBES
  </small>
  the punishment that befalls two groups of challengers. In the case of Dathan and Abiram, the rebels’ wives die along with their husbands. Yet in the Korah episode, only the men are punished. The story as a whole reflects a central biblical theme: the tension between a clan-based system of authority and a centralized system of priestly authority.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Dathan and Abiram represent what can be called clan heads or household heads. (The biblical terminology is not always consistent.) Early in Israel’s history, male heads of families had authority and jurisdiction over their families. For example, in
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
   Genesis 38
  </a>
  the patriarch Judah decides whether his pregnant, seemingly adulterous daughter-in-law Tamar should live or die. In contrast, the priest administers the ritual to determine whether a woman is an adulteress in
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_5.1-31">
   Numbers 5
  </a>
  .
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  According to the Bible, women within the clan system of authority played a significant role and exercised power as well as some authority. Although subject to the authority of the male head of the household, women clearly influenced the family head. For instance, unable to tolerate her rival, Sarah demands that Abraham expel Hagar. Despite Abraham’s reluctance, God tells him to obey Sarah (
  <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G21-10">
   Genesis 21:12
  </a>
  ).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Texts that focus on the priesthood shift authority away from the family’s head toward the central sanctuary and its priests. Women, in particular, are affected by this shift (see at
  <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#L26-30">
   Leviticus 26:30
  </a>
  ). Whereas in
  <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
   Genesis 38
  </a>
  Tamar actively works to secure her fate, in
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_5.1-31">
   Numbers 5
  </a>
  the suspected woman is a passive figure. The inclusion of the wives of Dathan and Abiram reflects the role that women played within the clan system.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Thus,
  <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#num_16.1-35">
   Numbers 16
  </a>
  is not only a story of infighting among families, ultimately championing Aaron and his descendants; it also tells a story about the seeming demise of an important notion of the “biblical family.” The deaths of Dathan, Abiram, and their wives at the doorway to their tents (
  <a href="#num16-27">
   16:27
  </a>
  ) make the point painfully clear: after all, the entrance to the tent is a place associated with theophany and judgment in the clan system, and hence also a symbol of authority (
  <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
   Genesis 18:1
  </a>
  ;
  <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#d22-21">
   Deuteronomy 22:21
  </a>
  ). Together, Dathan, Abiram,
  <i>
   and
  </i>
  their wives represent the clan system that must be erased—swallowed whole—in order to establish the authority of the priesthood.

    Now Korah…betook himself

  </i>
  (
  <a href="#num_16.1-35">
   16:1
  </a>
  ). Literally, “and Korah took” (
  <i>
   va-yikach Korach),
  </i>
  which presents a dilemma for translators and commentators since the verb lacks a direct object. What did Korah take? Midrash
  <i>
   B’midbar Rabbah
  </i>
  18.4 explains that Korah “took” his
  <i>
   tallit
  </i>
  —and went to get advice from his wife. BT
  <i>
   Sanhedrin
  </i>
  110a goes further and portrays Korah’s wife as playing an active role in the development of his resentment. She complains that Moses has become a king, his brother Aaron is chief priest, and Aaron’s sons are priests, while Levites such as Korah
  <a id="page_910">
  </a>
  are disadvantaged in a number of ways. Moreover, she continues, Moses humiliated the Levites by ordering them to shave their entire bodies (
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num8-5">
   8:7
  </a>
  ). Finally, Korah’s wife ridicules the commandment of
  <i>
   tzitzit
  </i>
  (
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num15-37">
   15:37–41
  </a>
  ), which requires the presence in the fringes of
  <i>
   t’cheilet
  </i>
  (a blue thread). If blue thread is so important, she asks rhetorically, why not wear a cloak made entirely of blue thread?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Why does the Babylonian Talmud—and, by implication,
  <i>
   B’midbar Rabbah
  </i>
  —portray Korah’s wife in this negative way? Rabbi Hanokh Zundel (author of the
  <i>
   Etz Yosef
  </i>
  commentary on
  <i>
   B’midbar Rabbah)
  </i>
  hypothesized that because Dathan’s and Abiram’s wives and children were with the rebels at the fateful moment of being swallowed up (
  <a href="#num16-27">
   16:27
  </a>
  ), their wives must have shared their husbands’ rebellious sentiments. Presumably, Korah’s wife also agreed with Korah’s anger. Of course, in a patriarchal society, women would have had little choice but to “agree” with their husbands. Korah’s wife, however, may have had a more specific motivation: given that Korah was a first cousin of Moses and Aaron, his rebellion was a family affair—at least in part. Korah’s wife may have zealously pursued what she saw as her husband’s legitimate interests against her powerful cousins-in-law. It is also possible that the Rabbis, who often impute the worst possible motives to women, are portraying Korah’s wife as another Eve who (in rabbinic lore) is leading her innocent husband into temptation and disaster.

    On son of Peleth
   </b>
  </i>
  (
  <a href="#num_16.1-35">
   16:1
  </a>
  ). The Rabbis give us a different model of a rebel’s spouse in their construction of the wife of On son of Peleth. The Rabbis assume that On did not see the rebellion through to the end, and thus he was spared the collective punishment. This is because he is listed among the rebels in
  <a href="#num_16.1-35">
   16:1
  </a>
  , but there is no specific mention of his death in
  <a href="#num16-23">
   16:23–35
  </a>
  when the rebels are destroyed. In a story found in two versions
  <i>
   (B’midbar Rabbah
  </i>
  18.20 and BT
  <i>
   Sanhedrin
  </i>
  109b–110a), the Rabbis attribute On’s rescue to his wife. In both versions, On’s wife points out to him that the rebellion will leave him no better off: he is currently subordinate to Aaron; if the rebellion is successful, he will be subordinate to Korah. She observes to herself, “I know that all of the congregation is holy,” citing as proof Korah’s own words in
  <a href="#num_16.1-35">
   16:3
  </a>
  . She then gets her husband drunk, puts him to bed, and sits at their front door with her hair undone and exposed. The holiness of the congregation is made manifest when the rebels approach the house to summon her husband—and withdraw immediately upon seeing her immodest appearance. By the time On awakens from his drunken sleep, the rebellion has been put down and the rebels destroyed.

 <div class="image">

 <div class="image0">

 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In the version of this story in the Midrash
  <i>
   (B’midbar Rabbah),
  </i>
  On never speaks; we do not know if he agrees with his wife or not. We may reasonably infer that he does not; otherwise, why would she have to get him drunk to put an end to his participation in the rebellion? In the version in the Talmud, however, On appears to agree with his spouse’s assessment of his status after the rebellion. When he asks her, “What should I do?” she makes her observation about communal holiness and executes her plan to save her family from destruction.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The possible appeal to women—especially poor women—of Korah’s overall critique of the Mosaic order is illustrated differently in
  <i>
   Midrash T’hillim
  </i>
  1:15. Korah is represented there as showing the injustice of Torah laws by pointing out their adverse impact on a widow with two daughters. Whether the poor widow wishes to plow, sow, harvest, or raise animals—Korah notes—Moses and Aaron are there to regulate how she should plow and sow, and to insist that she gives portions of her harvest and her herds to the priests. The widow, frustrated at all these restraints and exactions, ends up bereft and weeping together with her children.

   HAT A DRAMATIC
  </small>
  power struggle we have just witnessed in this parashah! A cabal of influential rebels tries to take power from Moses, daring to risk their lives to promote their own self-interest over the sacred destiny of their people. Their downfall is stark and dreadful.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Yet, the Torah teaches, even though Korah dies, his descendants live on (
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num25-11">
   Numbers 26:11
  </a>
  ). We certainly see them today: cynical political, religious, and communal leaders cloaking self-interest in the language of democracy, nationalism, or God. In wielding power in such shortsighted ways, these modern-day rebels present an even greater threat to God’s creation than Korah did to Moses’ leadership. This Torah portion urges us to be vigilant, lest such persons undermine the communities that we are called to create and sustain.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  But it is not only public leaders who play Korah’s role today. We, too, live with an ongoing conflict between an “inner Moses” and an “inner Korah”—between humility and arrogance, between selflessness and selfishness. And until we can hear the difference between those two voices, our actions will not be effective in countering the power of the Korahs at large in the world. We need to be clear when it is the voice of our needy, small-minded self that advises us to act, or when it is the wise voice that speaks from our deepest and best values and truth. We need a practice of reflection to discern which voice is guiding us. Happily, we can also find some guidance in this parashah.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In our tradition Moses is seen as humility embodied—the true servant of God. The
  <i>
   S’fas Emes,
  </i>
  a 19th-century Hasidic master, understood Moses as being so far from pride in his bearing that people could not fathom his modesty. In
  <i>
   parashat Korach,
  </i>
  we see Moses in that place of humility, able to lead because he loves God and the Israelites with every fiber of his being, despite his constant frustration with both of them. Twice he falls on his face—before Korah and before God—trying to stop the rebellion and to prevent God from destroying the persistently disobedient Israelites. Moses acts from the deep understanding that Korah’s challenge has nothing to do with him; it is a challenge to God. He knows himself to be the vessel through which God’s vision for the Israelites could become manifest, not the man who has to prove himself superior to an insolent competitor. Throughout the journeys of the Israelites, we see Moses grow as a spiritual leader: from a reluctant young man who struggles with anger and lack of self-confidence to become the quintessential leader—one who is able to overcome his own ego in order to serve a much greater cause. Finally, he becomes one who accepts God’s decision that he will die—and that he will die outside the land of Israel.

 <div class="image0">

 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Korah is different. His challenge to Moses is rooted in personal ambition, not love of God or of the Israelites. Unlike Moses, who hesitated to take the leadership that God offered, Korah seeks to grab it for himself. Tradition interprets the opening of the parashah—literally “And Korah took”—to mean that he took himself
  <i>
   apart from the people
  </i>
  (Tzvi Hirsch Kalischer;
  <i>
   Torah Gems,
  </i>
  1998, p. 77). Korah would have done nothing to stop God from destroying the Israelites, for he would have loved to be the sire of a whole new people. Unlike Moses, Korah sees the whole story as being about himself and the role he wants to play as a powerful chief priest.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Reading this parashah, I ask: how do I recognize Korah in my own thoughts and actions, and how do I liberate the consciousness that Moses had? In my job
  <a id="page_912">
  </a>
  as the director of a wonderful non-profit institute, I find that Korah seems to pop up most frequently when I am afraid. What if I don’t succeed at raising enough money? What if I don’t succeed at making our work known? What if I am not good enough? What if this work fails because of my incompetence? In such moments of doubt, I make myself the central actor on stage, starring in the “The Tragedy of Rachel.” In that place of fear, I separate myself from the community doing the work, and I clutch for some way to feel in control. I can’t see the whole. There is no way to make wise decisions.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  But if I make time, like Moses, to fall on my face—to breathe and reflect—I can hear the “I” shouting out in all its grandiosity. I reply,
  <i>
   “Rav l’kha
  </i>
  (Enough of this), Korah!”—acknowledging that once again I have made the story about me and my fears. In that space, Moses can emerge and call me back to humility—to the recognition that I, like everybody else, am but a bit player on this stage. I can rekindle the trust that I have in the wisdom of the unfolding of the work and in the wisdom of my colleagues to figure out what will flow from this moment.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The Korah in all of us gets triggered by different emotions: fear, anger, anxiety, greed or doubt. When this happens, we lose sight of the whole and become caught up in our own inner dramas. Our needs eclipse the needs of others.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Moses’ path—and ours—is to move from the narrow place of doubt, fear, anger, and jealousy to an expansive covenanted life in a community of mutual care and responsibility. In such a community, all people are holy. They—we—can remind each other that what matters is not the ambition of the self, but the work of helping to make the soul, the home, the office, and the world a safer, wiser, more compassionate place for all. Such a perspective helps each of us to come closer to being a humble servant of God.
