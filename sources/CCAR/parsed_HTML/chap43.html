  <i>
   (The Women’s Torah Commentary,
  </i>
  ed. Elyse Goldstein, 2000, p. 321). Specifically, God delineates the borders of the land and then appoints leaders from each tribe to oversee the distribution of each tribal portion.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  After God and Moses assign the tribes their territories, the focus falls on the one tribe that is noticeably absent from the list: the Levites. Instead of possessing their own portion of land, the Levites will receive forty-eight cities in which to dwell. Since six of these cities will be set aside as cities of refuge for those guilty of unintentional homicide, God’s speech turns to a definition of murder, the requirements for witnesses in capital cases, and other relevant rules to ensure safety and equity.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The book of Numbers concludes by revisiting the case of the daughters of Zelophehad, with a stipulation added to ensure that the ancestral territories they inherit will always belong to their tribe, Manasseh.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  At the conclusion of the book of Numbers, the people stand at the plains of Moab, poised to enter the Promised Land. Here, the story of Israel’s journey ends. (The book of Deuteronomy—which is composed almost entirely of Moses’ speeches—does not carry the story further except in its final scene, the death of Moses.)

  Although not visible in the travel accounts recorded in this parashah, women come to the fore at the end of the book, with the story about Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the five daughters of Zelophehad who are entitled to inherit his land (
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  ). In
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
   Numbers 36
  </a>
  , leaders of their clan raise a concern: the land might be lost to the tribe if the women marry men from another tribe. Moses solves the problem by restricting the group from which the daughters may choose a spouse. Even though
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
   Numbers 36
  </a>
  restricts their
  <a id="page_1014">
  </a>
  marriage options to those of their tribe, it also guarantees that the five women will have what they demanded in
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num27-4">
   27:4
  </a>
  —an inheritance among their kin. In addition, and as a result, their names are perpetuated in Israel’s story.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The appearance of these five women at the conclusion of Numbers mirrors the reference to five women at the beginning of Exodus: Shiphrah and Puah, Moses’ unnamed mother and sister (later identified as Jochebed and Miriam), and Pharaoh’s daughter (
  <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_1.1-22">
   Exodus 1–2
  </a>
  ), all of whom engaged in saving children’s lives, Moses’ life in particular. These two sets of five courageous and resourceful women thus form the bookends of Israel’s journey from slavery.

  This section contains the Torah’s longest continuous list of the places where the Israelites encamped. To this day, the location of many of these places eludes biblical scholars and archeologists; the list is in tension with other accounts of the journey and may include symbolic elements no longer detectable. The narratives of Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy also mention many of the places recounted in this section, but sometimes in a different order. Many scholars think that the editors of the Torah used this ancient list in
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_33.1-56">
   Numbers 33
  </a>
  as a guide by which to arrange the individual episodes of Exodus and Numbers. Certain places evoke incidents recounted in other biblical narratives, whereas some remain otherwise unknown.

  DIRECTIVES FOR THE FUTURE (33:50–56)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  God instructs Moses to proclaim an entrance strategy, describing the protocol concerning the inhabitants of Canaan. The instructions are concise and severe, calling upon the Israelites to dispossess the inhabitants completely; to destroy figured objects, molten images, and all worship places; and then to settle in the land. They are instructed to divide the land in proportion to the size of the tribes (or perhaps of the clans) once they enter the land. They are warned that God would destroy them should they neglect to destroy all the inhabitants. The rationale for complete destruction of the inhabitants is the danger that their presence would pose for Israel’s future. According to Numbers’ ideology, as well as Deuteronomy’s, Israel cannot survive if it is subject to the influence and presence of Canaanites. The perspective of this disturbing mandate reflects an understanding of Israel as small, inhabiting a landscape surrounded by (and infiltrated by) a stronger and more numerous people, the Canaanites. Historically speaking, the Canaanites and the Israelites were closely related. For example, what we know of contemporaneous Canaanite languages is that (like Phoenician to the north, and Moabite to the east) they were very close to Hebrew. Indeed, historians argue that the separation of Israelites from other Canaanites was a slow process. Some scholars maintain that the Bible is most severe with regard to Canaanites because Canaanite culture is most easily confused with that of Israel, as it attempts to establish a distinct identity.

  n this unit, composed entirely of God’s words to Moses, God marks the specific borders of Canaan, so that the people will learn the extent of the territory that they will inherit. Since Moses will not be accompanying the people across the Jordan, Joshua and Eleazar will lead the appointed tribal leaders in the division of lands. Discussion of external boundaries and tribal chiefs quickly moves to laws concerning the internal workings of the community.

  APPOINTING LEADERS TO OVERSEE LAND ALLOTMENT (34:16–29)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  God commands Moses to appoint Joshua and Eleazar to oversee the tribal leaders in the apportioning of land. Why not select Caleb to work with Joshua? After all, Joshua and Caleb had been partners previously, as when they brought back a favorable report after the scouting expedition; hence they are the only non-Levites in the Exodus generation who will live to enter the Promised Land (
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num_vv.14.1-45a">
   Numbers 14
  </a>
  ). Here, God chooses a priest, not another military leader, to help in the delicate process of dividing territory. As a priest, Eleazar will not inherit land; thus his leadership is both logical and invaluable.

 <div class="head2" id="num_35.1-34">
  BUILDING A JUST INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES OF REFUGE (35:1–34)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Having delineated the land’s boundaries, the Torah turns to guidelines for living within those boundaries. Any emerging social group must incorporate explicit directions for dealing with homicide, both intentional and unintentional. The Bible carefully predicts different situations with varying degrees of conflict in order to protect the rights of both the victim’s family and the one who is responsible for an accidental homicide.

  According to
  <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#N18-21">
   Numbers 18:21–24
  </a>
  , the tribe of the Levites is not to receive its own land like the other tribes but to serve as special personnel dedicated to God’s service, for which they are due to receive a share of tithes from Israelite produce. Now we learn that the Levites will receive, in addition, forty-two towns in which their families can live. The pastureland that they are to receive with their cities is not official farmland—what the Bible calls
  <i>
   nachalah.
  </i>
  Rather, the land is to serve as pasture areas for their respective cities. The difference between these levitical city pastures and the farmland inheritances of other tribes is in the size and in the nature of the inheritance. The Levites are also to receive six cities of refuge for those guilty of unintentional homicide.

  Although the Hebrew wording is not gender-specific, the translation presumes that this role was a man’s job. In the ancient Near East, using weapons to defend the family honor was typically the responsibility of men. According to David Stein, women apparently were not expected to undertake an active hunt for the killer of their kin, but if an opportunity for vengeance presented itself to a woman in the victim’s family, she might choose to seize that opportunity

  </i>
  The Torah offers those who kill accidentally a safe haven from angry and grief-stricken relatives, discouraging both those who may wish to take the law into their own hands and those who may otherwise feel obliged to avenge out of a sense of duty. In addition to the physical protection afforded by a walled city, this institution protects the killer by making the victim’s relatives liable for bloodguilt if they choose to disregard the law.

  These verses describe various cases of homicide. Verses 16–18 discuss acts unequivocally deemed intentional homicide, so the offender is expected to die by none other than the avenging relative. Only this formula can complete the Torah’s particular ordained cycle of blood vengeance.

  The (presumably natural) death of the chief priest marks the end period of the killer’s culpability. Although the Hebrew Bible generally frowns on regarding a person’s death as atonement for another’s sin, the death of the chief priest seems to function that way symbolically. Although no one is killed, the priest’s death benefits the life of another. The killer can return home, thus ending the exile.

  A single witness cannot convict a suspected killer in cases of capital offense. It is not only the gravity of the situation for the suspect that demands verifiable testimony but also the risk to the community, lest it mistakenly condemn itself to death for permitting the shedding of more innocent blood.

  The biblical principle of bloodguilt, in which the spilled blood of murder must be avenged by causing the murderer’s own blood to flow, was implicit in vv. 18–19, and is implicit again in vv. 31–32. Finally, vv. 33–34 explain the root of this principle: If a victim’s blood is not avenged, the land becomes polluted. Examples of this concept can be found throughout the Hebrew Bible. For example, in
  <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge4-10">
   Genesis 4:10
  </a>
  , God reproaches Cain saying, “What have you done? Your brother’s blood is shrieking to Me from the ground.” This passage of Numbers teaches that no bloodguilt is required from someone who kills unintentionally.

  he last episode in the book of Numbers is devoted entirely to the case of Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah. In one sense, their story seeks to resolve a potential crossing of boundaries in a book particularly concerned with setting boundaries (because the daughters’ land risks being transferred to another tribe). In another sense, the story of these five sisters forms a counterpoint to stories about the five women in
  <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_1.1-22">
   Exodus 1
  </a>
  and
  <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.1-22">

  </a>
  who rescued Israelite children: the midwives Shiphrah and Puah, Moses’ unnamed mother (later identified as Jochebed), Moses’ unnamed sister (later identified as Miriam), and Pharaoh’s unnamed daughter. Although there is no more than a literary connection between these two groups of women, the framing of Israel’s journey as a whole with stories of women creates a symbolic symmetry.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">

  , the five daughters were granted the right to inherit their dead father’s land, with no strings attached. In this parashah, at the urging of leaders of the clan and in order to protect it from losing the land permanently, Moses proclaims a new law that requires the women to marry only within their clan or tribe (v. 6; the instructions are not clear as to whether the husband must come from the clan or can be anyone in the larger tribe).
 </div>

  The clan leaders of the five sisters point out a potential problem: granting land to the sisters might mean loss of land to the Manasseh tribe if the women marry men from other tribes and their shares become parts of their husbands’ tribes.

  At the heart of the issue stand two related laws. First, the requirement that the land allotted to each tribe should belong to that group permanently. Second, that at the fifty-year jubilee, land that has been transferred or sold returns to the permanent owner (see at
  <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">

  There are three ways to explain the concern about the loss of the clan’s land. Most likely the complaint anticipates that the inherited land will eventually belong to the women’s sons and thus (if the husband is from another tribe) no longer be part of the Gilead/Manasseh tribe. It is also possible that the complaint implies that the women belong to the clan of their husband when they marry and therefore their land also belongs to that tribe. A third, but least likely, possibility is that the complaint implies that, in marriage, the land will become the husband’s property.

  In the first episode of the three scenes about Zelophehad’s daughters, Moses had brought their case before God (
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#page_973">
   27:5

  </i>
  The free choice of spouses granted to the five sisters is especially significant in the context of the ancient world, because it excludes any male relative who wishes to claim the more typical role of a guardian for the unmarried daughters. Contrast this with the status of the heiress in classical Athens who is subject to the automatic control by a male relative in regard to marriage, as the way of protecting and preserving family property.

     “provided they marry into a clan of their father’s tribe.”

  From a modern perspective, this restriction might appear as a step back after the forward steps in
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  , since God’s law granted the land to the sisters in
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  with no strings attached. Practically speaking, however, the freedom to choose a spouse from their clan is less constricting than it might seem, given the size of this tribe (one of the largest among the Israelites).

    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  An attempt to secure the greater good of protecting tribal ownership of the land, rather than a gender-specific goal, stands as the basis for restricting the marriage choices of the sisters. In other words, the issue of who inherits land is not depicted as an objection to women’s owning land but rather as a concern for preserving tribal ownership of allotted land.

  Like the ruling that allows all daughters to inherit land when there are no sons (
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#chap-fn8-3">

  The sister’s names appear for the first time in this parashah. Whereas the speakers thus far (the relatives and Moses) refer to the five sisters as “Zelophehad’s daughters” (vv. 2, 6), the narrator now calls them by their names. The sisters’ own names appear in all three episodes about them. The order here, however, differs from that of
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  and Joshua 17, and there is no obvious explanation for the sequence. On the names and their connection to places, see at

    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  Although they can marry any man from the very large tribe of Manasseh, the sisters choose their cousins. There is no reason to suppose (as Jacob Milgrom does) that the land was transferred to the husbands once the women married (
  <i>
   Numbers
  </i>
  , 1990, p. 298). The Bible does not prohibit wives from owning property.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Furthermore, the earliest Jewish contracts that we have illustrate that women continued to own property after marriage and that parents bequeathed property to both sons and daughters. Documents from the Jewish community in Elephantine, Egypt, include several marriage contracts and sale contracts. In several documents (dated around 460–447
  <small>
   B.C.E.
  </small>
  ), the father of Mibtahiah transfers property to her even though he has sons. The property remains hers at marriage. In one case, her husband, who apparently improved one of the several properties in question, or is expected to, is assured that he will have power over half of that particular property “for the improvement which you made” (Cowley 9:11–12). He cannot sell that half, and it goes to their children after him (Cowley 9). In another contract dated 434
  <small>
   B.C.E.
  </small>
  , a husband transfers ownership of half of a newly purchased property to his wife irreversibly and makes their children (a boy and a girl) equal heirs of his portion (Kraeling 4).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  It is difficult to assess the relationships between practices of this particular Jewish community and those in the Bible and ancient Israel in earlier periods. But evidence that women retained their property after marriage and were also able to inherit should caution us against concluding otherwise in this case without evidence. Moreover, the appearance of some of the women’s names as place names on early clay fragments suggest that they were recognized as primary owners (see below at
  <a href="#chap-fn12-3a">
   v. 12
  </a>
  and at
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">

    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  To underscore the perfect execution of divine command, the narrator adds that the women’s marriages indeed preserve the inherited land within their father’s tribe. The story of Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah will conclude in Joshua 17, in the report about apportioning the land among the tribes. There, we read that “Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah…appeared before the priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the chieftains, saying: ‘
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
   יהוה
  </span>
  commanded Moses to grant us a portion among our male kinsmen.’ So, in accordance with
  <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
   יהוה
  </span>
  ’s instructions, they were granted a portion among their father’s kinsmen” (
  <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#num_17.1-28">
   17:3–4
  </a>
  ). This passage makes no mention of their husbands. Furthermore, “Manasseh’s daughters inherited a portion in these together with his sons, while the land of Gilead was assigned to the rest of Manasseh’s descendants” (
  <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#num17-6">
   17:6
  </a>
  ; note that in Joshua the women are also called “Manasseh’s daughters”!). Although the historical reliability of the material in Joshua is subject to debate, it is safe to say that the book of Joshua portrays the inheritance of Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah as a large one. The 8th-century-
  <small>
   B.C.E.
  </small>
  clay fragments that bear names of towns, including Noah and Hoglah, illustrate the persistence of these names in Israelite tradition (see the introduction to
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27:1–2
  </a>
  ). Tirzah is also the name of the royal city in the Northern Kingdom in the 10th century (see I Kings 14). (For more on the daughters’ names, see at

   DESCRIBED
  </small>
  the amending of a law regarding who may inherit land: Zelophehad’s daughters—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah—brought their case before Moses; after they demanded their share of the land, the law was amended to enable them to inherit their father’s land. However, in this parashah (
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
   Numbers 36
  </a>
  ), the clan heads of their tribe approach Moses and ask him to prevent the discrimination stemming from the previously amended law. Apparently, correcting the earlier inequity created a new one, this time for the tribe to which they belong. As before, Moses amends the legislation, under God’s guidance.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The two stories, taken together, nicely illustrate the fact that some laws in the Torah are the outcome of cooperation between God and human beings. This raises the question concerning the nature of the Torah’s laws. Most of the commandments in the Torah appear as if written a priori and seem sealed and unchangeable. Nevertheless, five commandments happen to be the outcome of certain circumstances that called for God’s intervention and resulted in new legislation and amendments. (The other three cases are: the stories of the blasphemer in
  <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_24.10-23">
   Leviticus 24:10–16
  </a>
  ; the man gathering sticks in
  <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#N15-32">
   Numbers 15:32–36
  </a>
  ; and the ritually impure individuals prevented from bringing the paschal offering on time in
  <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_9.15-10.36">
   9:1–14
  </a>
  .)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The Torah could have preserved only the final laws, without the narratives that describe their emergence. But it seems that the Torah intentionally highlights a principle of dialogue between human groups and divine legislation. The purpose of the laws is that “one shall live by them” (
  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L18-5">
   Leviticus 18:5
  </a>
  ), meaning that the laws of the Torah must fit life. Such a goal is achieved by an openness to change, albeit with God’s explicit consent and command. As a result, this parashah constitutes the philosophical basis for the Oral Torah—that is, the ongoing, authoritative interpretations of Scripture. The presupposition is that its legal kernel and principles are embedded within the Written Torah, and that through different sorts of exegesis of the Torah (that is, through its explanation and interpretation), the Oral Torah is fleshed out. By way of constant searching, responses are revealed to neverending questions.

  <i>
   Tanchuma, Mas’ei
  </i>
  11 draws a parallel to a king who takes his child on a journey to seek a cure for the child’s sickness. On the return trip, the doting father recalls each leg of the original trip, remembering how they traveled together and how he worried about his child’s condition. So the Torah in recalling the journey calls to mind the struggle God had with the Israelites in the wilderness.

   Tanchuma, Mas’ei

  11 draws a parallel between God’s punishment of Adam and the law of the individual

God had told Adam that eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge would result in his death; nevertheless, God was merciful and exiled Adam from the Garden of Eden as a punishment for bringing death into the world. So too this law shows compassion for a person who accidentally kills another human being, exiling the killer to a city of refuge rather than mandating the killer’s death.

  <i>
   Makot

  2:5 even considers the possibility that the killer and his victim might be relatives, leading to a situation where to avenge one family member, a person might seek vengeance on another relative.

  <i>

  30b;
  <i>

  </i>
  120a) indicate that this law, requiring daughters who inherit from their father to marry within the clan, applied only to the generation of the wilderness, or to a time in which land was held by the tribes (Baruch HaLevi Epstein,
  <i>

  ). This statement seems contradictory. A tradition in BT
  <i>

  120a explains that the daughters of Zelophehad were permitted to marry into any of the tribes, but the Torah advised them to make “suitable” marriages that would please bot hthemselves and their father’s clan members.

  ). Zelophehad’s daughters are listed in a different order here than in
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  . According to BT
  <i>
   Bava Batra
  </i>
  120a, this indicates that each of them was equal to the other. This text also suggests that
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
   Numbers 36
  </a>
  lists the women in the order in which they were born, while
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  mentions them in order of wisdom.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  These different orders are cited in several 19thcentury anecdotes that discuss women’s experiences and characteristics (cited in A. Y. Greenberg,
  <i>
   Itturei Torah
  </i>
  on 36:11). A disciple of Rabbi Elijah ben Solomon Zalman (“the Vilna Gaon”) was approached by a man who complained that after marrying his son to the daughter of an important man, he discovered that his daughter-in-law, a woman whom he described as both intelligent and pious, was ten years older than her new husband. The rabbi responded with humor, pointing out that the daughters of Zelophehad were listed in chronological order only after they were married, to teach that a woman’s age should not be mentioned while she is single since it becomes irrelevant after marriage.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In another story, the wife of Rabbi Saul of Amsterdam, known in her youth as a brilliant woman, was asked why she had abandoned her studies after marrying and having children. She replied by noting that before their marriage, the daughters of Zelophehad were listed by (that is, known for) their wisdom, but “after they married and accepted the millstone [of household duties and childrearing] around their necks, their wisdom was forgotten and they were thereafter listed by their ages.” This story acknowledges the challenges that intelligent and learned women faced in continuing their studies in a society that expected married women to devote themselves to their husbands and children.

   HE LAST PARASHAH
  </small>
  in the book of Numbers ends with a second story about the five daughters of Zelophehad—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. The first story, in
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  , shows how the sisters demanded and received a promise—from God, no less—that they will inherit their family’s ancestral land (since their father died without leaving a son). Here in
  <i>
   parashat Mas’ei,
  </i>
  the daughters’ male relatives challenge the women’s inheritance right in order to protect ownership of tribal land. Moses responds
  <i>
   al pi Adonai
  </i>
  —“at God’s bidding” (
  <a href="#num36-5">
   36:5
  </a>
  ), by amending the new law. The change requires women who inherit ancestral land to marry into a family of their father’s tribe (
  <a href="#num36-6">
   36:6
  </a>
  ), thereby limiting these women’s choice of spouses, but keeping the property within the tribe. The parashah and the book end by confirming that the sisters did marry accordingly.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  This sequel in
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
   Numbers 36
  </a>
  appears to be a setback after the daughters’ startling triumph in
  <i>
   parashat Pinchas
  </i>
  (
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
   Numbers 27
  </a>
  ), where they won significant inheritance rights for themselves and for their “sisters” in the future. The five sisters in particular, and Israelite women in general, walk away from
  <i>
   parashat Mas’ei
  </i>
  with less than they had before. As some scholars observe, when the sisters marry their first cousins, they essentially hand over their inheritance to the same men who would otherwise have inherited the land had the women never stood up for themselves (Hara E. Person, “Masa’ei: Boundaries and Limits,” in
  <i>
   The Women’s Torah Commentary,
  </i>
  2000, p. 327; and Jacob Milgrom,
  <i>
   Numbers,
  </i>
  1990, p. 298). Moreover, in giving up some of their gains for the sake of larger familial and communal needs, they seem to perpetuate the all-too-familiar situation of women foregoing their own needs for the sake of others in the family.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Nevertheless, while the decree in this parashah certainly is a step back from the full rights given to the daughters previously, it is not a full retreat; they still end up with more than they had in the first place. To begin with, the sisters marry from a position of strength, not dependency. What would have happened to the sisters had they not stepped forward to ask for their inheritance? Given the frequency with which the Torah reminds us of our societal obligation to care for widows and orphans, we can guess what might have happened to Zelophehad’s daughters had they remained landless. Furthermore, the daughters’ actions and triumph eliminate a whole category of dependent orphans (the girls and women who until then did not inherit).
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The story of Zelophehad’s daughters invites us to reflect on the roles that family members and community play in one’s life. Our freedom as women to make choices and demands stems in part from our Jewish heritage in which women such as Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah stood together to argue for equal rights, convincing leadership—human and divine—of the justness of their cause.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  Today our individual commitments and decisions from the everyday to the profound (taking a class at night, accepting a board position, making a career change) affect our partners and our children, regardless of who makes them. Likewise, our seemingly private decisions launch a whole range of new communal developments. For example, working and studying mothers and their partners require, and therefore initiate, new structures for childcare that were not available to the previous generation. Such choices compel (or inspire) others to “think outside the box” to accommodate new challenges.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  <a id="page_1033">
  </a>
  Especially in egalitarian relationships, each person’s words and visions, choices and decisions, actions and reactions, construct an unfolding dialogue, evergrowing and often life-changing in much wider circles than one would have envisioned. What began as a seemingly private demand by five sisters for their share of land became a new law to protect all women in unforeseen circumstances.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  In
  <i>
   parashat Mas’ei,
  </i>
  at the end of the Israelites’ journey in the wilderness, the amending of the ruling for Zelophehad’s daughters (along with the concomitant change in inheritance laws in perpetuity for all Israelites,
  <a href="#chap-fn7-3">
   36:8–9
  </a>
  ) teaches modern lessons for intertwined lives: in a society, community, or family, one person’s needs and desires must be weighed against those of others. Final authority should not belong to one member only, nor should laws be made based on the interests of only one party.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The amendments in
  <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
   Numbers 36
  </a>
  also emphasize the need for lawmakers to look always at the rights of
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  citizens, and not just at the issues brought by lobbyists. The women’s movement, like all movements of liberation, discovered long ago that the most effective and enduring changes are those that create justice for
  <i>
   all
  </i>
  members of society.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  This observation does not negate the need to speak out for special interests. Just as the prayer of our matriarch Hannah became for the rabbis of the Talmud the model of how to pray (I Samuel 1:10–11; BT
  <i>
   B’rachot
  </i>
  31a–b), so in their own time, the daughters of Zelophehad model how to be an advocate for one’s own rights. Had Hannah not prayed or the sisters not spoken up, no change would have taken place. Speaking out opens up a public space where the diverse needs of community members can be examined in order to negotiate for equitable resolutions. Because the original ruling given in
  <i>
   parashat Pinchas
  </i>
  benefited the daughters but not the tribe, the amendment here in
  <i>
   parashat Mas’ei
  </i>
  demonstrates how an idea may require fine-tuning even after it becomes law.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The ending of the book of Numbers sets the stage for processes of change, showing us that even within the Torah itself, lawmaking is an inexact science requiring flexibility to change as issues arise and society evolves. We honor the sisters’ ability to speak up, and their grace to concede when their gain is shown to be against community interests. We are the inheritors of their chutzpah and their quest for equal rights.
