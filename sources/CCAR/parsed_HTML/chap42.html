  (“tribes”) presents final preparations for entering into the Promised Land and offers further guidelines to the Israelites for practices once they settle in the land. As the Israelites camp in the plains of Moab, their final stop before entering the land, God instructs Moses on matters that relate to the internal workings of the Israelite community and also to the community’s relationship with its neighbors.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The parashah first supplements earlier laws about vows (
  <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_27.1-34">
   Leviticus 27
  </a>
  ;
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_6.1-27">
   Numbers 6
  </a>
  ), then picks up the story about the incident at Baal-peor, where Israelite men sinned by succumbing to idolatry (
  <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_25.1-9">
   Numbers 25
  </a>
  ). In that earlier account at Baal-peor, the priest Phinehas appeased God’s wrath by killing two chief offenders, an Israelite man and a Midianite woman. In this parashah, God demands that the Israelites fight against the Midianites and thereby avenge that earlier wrong.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  After the successful war against the Midianites, two tribes request to remain east of the Jordan. Moses resolves this potential split among the tribes by granting the request on the condition that the fighting men from these tribes will cross the Jordan with the rest of the tribes while their families settle down in the eastern region, as requested.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Women are prominent in the discussions of both vows and the war against the Midianites. In the first case, the text delineates the rights of women who make vows (
  <a href="#num_30.2-17">
   30:2–17
  </a>
  ). These instructions shed important light on the status of women within the family and illustrate the circumstances under which the male head of the household can overrule decisions made by the women within the household. At the same time, these detailed laws indicate that women could make independent vows to God and, under normal circumstances, would be held accountable for fulfilling them.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  The subsequent section on war against the Midianites (
  <a href="#num_31.1-54">
   31:1–12
  </a>
  ) focuses on Midianite women as the chief culprits in Israel’s earlier transgressions at Baal-peor (
  <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_25.1-9">
   25:1–18
  </a>
  ). The structure of the parashah thus indirectly contrasts the Israelite women (wh article that can withstand o turn to God) with the foreign “perverse” women of Midian (who turn Israelite men away from God).

  in
  <a href="#n31-21">

  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_6.1-27">

  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_6.1-27">

  Scholars debate whether the legal scenarios depicted in this unit were ever applied before exile (587

  ), or whether they are the product of the later Persian period (539–330
  <small>

 <div class="tab-enin">
  In the Bible, the noun
  <i>
   neder
  </i>
  (“vow”) denotes a promise to dedicate something to God only if and when the supplicant’s request is fulfilled. Such conditional pledges are attested also in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Ugarit (a kingdom situated on the coast of what is now Lebanon during the 14th-12th centuries
  <small>
   B.C.E.
  </small>
  ). All vows and oaths are sworn or taken in God’s name.

  Moses prepares the Israelites by instructing the leaders. The word

  A MAN’S VOWS AND OATHS (30:3)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The discussion of men’s vows is very brief, stressing that a male householder—or a man in general, according to most interpreters—is not to go back on his word when he utters a vow to God. The story about Jephthah in Judges 11 illustrates the seriousness with which vows were regarded. Judges tells of a warrior named Jephthah who vows to sacrifice whoever or whatever first comes out from his house should he win a battle (Judges 11:30–31). Tragically, his only child—a daughter—comes out to meet him and thus becomes the promised victim. The daughter, whose name is never revealed, willingly capitulates to her father’s obligation to fulfill his vow. She only requests two months with her women companions in order to lament the fact that she will die a virgin. Judges then reports that after her death, “it became a custom in Israel for the maidens of Israel to go every year, for four days in the year, and chant dirges for the daughter of Jephthah” (Judges 11:39–40).

  People typically make vows in times of great distress, as when ill or infertile. A vow can be made in private and does not need to be witnessed by a priest or a similar functionary, but apparently it is to be uttered aloud. Thus in I Samuel 1, when Hannah makes a vow in the presence of a priest, she does not need him to officiate or approve (I Samuel 1:9–14).

  Two kinds of oaths exist in the Bible. First, an oath can establish innocence if a person has been charged with a crime. See, for example, the oath of the woman accused of adultery (in rabbinic parlance, a
  <i>
   sotah)
  </i>
  in
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#vfn16-1">
   Numbers 5:20–25
  </a>
  . The second kind of oath, like the vow, is a binding promise to another party, as in the context of a covenant, with at least one member of the party invoking God (Baruch Levine,
  <i>
   Numbers 21–36,
  </i>
  2000, p. 428).

  A WOMAN’S VOWS AND OATHS (30:4–17)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Although we do not know how common it was for women to make vows or oaths, or what these typically entailed, the laws in this parashah establish, at the very least, that the biblical writers assumed that women were making vows and oaths, and that these situations required legal attention on the part of the writer. The discussion of vows in
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#n29-39">
   Numbers 29:39
  </a>
  already implicitly includes women. In this parashah, however, women’s vows constitute a major subject. The chief concern seems to be to regulate the impact that a woman’s vow might have upon the household (which is represented by the male head of the household: her father or husband). Vows and oaths grant women a sphere in which they can articulate certain needs and have them met (consider Hannah wishing for a son and promising that son to God, irrespective of her husband’s views on the matter, I Samuel 1). The laws perhaps indicate men’s concern that the vow of a woman in their household could lead to a destabilizing loss of property. As we will see, however, the power of some women to make vows or oaths is not cut off. Rather, male heads of households are given veto power in certain situations. Widows and divorcées are free from such constraints.

  <i>
   A Woman’s Vow or Oath Uttered in Her Father’s House
  </i>
  (30:4–6)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en">
  The first discussion of women and vows or oaths establishes the parameters of authority for women still in their father’s household. The woman is not described as a child. Nonetheless, under certain conditions, her father can annul her vows and oaths. The text does not indicate the kinds of vows and oaths that women might have made or the kinds of materials they might have promised. In this passage, the lawmakers seem to accommodate both benevolent and anxious fathers, so a father is allowed to annul his daughter’s vow or oath under certain conditions.

    <a href="#chap-fn4-1" id="chap-fn04-1">
     If a woman makes a vow.
    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  The Bible does not limit the kind of property that can be vowed, and it mentions several women who make vows. We deduce from such sources that vows included a wide variety of promised offerings. For example, Hannah vows to dedicate to the sanctuary the son whom she hopes to bear (I Samuel 1:11). Women can dedicate themselves as nazirites (
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_6.1-27">
   Numbers 6:2
  </a>
  ). And in Proverbs 7:10–21, a married woman reports that she has fulfilled her vow by making a payment (
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#n7-12">
   7:14
  </a>
  ). The nature of Proverbs as wisdom literature makes it difficult to assess its value as reflecting ancient practices. Jacques Berlinerblau argues that the polemical purpose of the story in Proverbs is to warn men against seductive women, which makes the text an unreliable source for the lives of real women (
  <i>
   The Vow and the “Popular Religious Groups” of Ancient Israel: A Philological and Sociological Inquiry
  </i>
  , 1996, pp. 141–3). Nevertheless, the story suggests that readers are expected to find it credible that a married woman could make independent vows.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">

    <a href="#chap-fn4-1a" id="chap-fn04-1a">
     assumes an obligation.
    </a>
   </b>
  </i>
  [The Hebrew actually refers to prohibiting something to oneself, that is abstaining from something. This expression, like “vow,” appears in every single verse from
  <a href="#num_30.2-17">
   vv. 3–15
  </a>
  . Together, the terms treat obligations that are positive (to do something) and negative (to not do something), both types operating under the same rules. Unlike the vows that pledge to give something to God (or the sanctuary) should one’s request be fulfilled, the prohibition means denying something to oneself (possibly only for a stated period of time), like nazirite vows, which are largely about abstaining from certain foods. In her book
  <i>
   Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medieval Women
  </i>
  (1988), Carolyn Bynum illustrates how women, under the rubrics of piety, used food not merely for self-control but for control of circumstances. She also argues that through self-imposed food practices women managed to develop their own practices and social roles. It is conceivable that such considerations are at work with the preoccupation with women’s vows and self-denials here. Other areas where self-denial may operate might concern specific household responsibilities, privileges, and marital relationships. In all these arenas, women who undertake an oath to forego certain things have an impact on the household in general and the authority of men in particular. This may account for the lengthy discussion of women’s vows. —

  That is, she is unmarried and most likely does not own property. By implication, anything she offers as a pledge belongs to the household, not to her, including a measure of control of her sexuality. A father typically sets the terms of his daughter’s marriage, including the required bridal gift, and he may subject her to debt-slavery (see at
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-7">
   Exodus 21:7–11
  </a>
  ). This verse shows that a vow is not contingent on a person’s legal right to own property. A woman, even one who is young and unmarried, can still utter binding vows and oaths; she does not require her father’s consent. However, he has the option of annulling the vow under certain conditions. This law affirms a woman’s practice. In addition, there may be a practical, economic consideration: the priestly authors of this text, or their descendants, most likely would benefit from additional sanctuary dedications collected from women’s vows.

  </i>
  We are not privy to the woman’s exact age. She could be on the cusp of eligibility for marriage or of marriageable age. We might expect that this woman is either a little younger or a little older than 12. The use of the term “woman” rather than “girl” or “daughter” suggests that the vows of children are not valid. The law does not explicitly account for an unmarried woman who is neither “youthful,” widowed, nor divorced.

  Although her father may be angry that she vowed the household’s property or her time to the sanctuary, there is no penalty imposed upon the woman for simply making the vow. Jacob Milgrom suggests that the woman ought not feel guilty on account of the canceled vow (

   A Married Woman’s Vow or Oath
  </i>
  (30:7–9)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en">
  According to certain passages of the Bible, married women live under the authority of their husbands; but, like the young woman living in her father’s house, they can dedicate their husband’s property (perhaps even their own) or some of their time to the sanctuary. When Hannah utters her vow in the Shiloh sanctuary (I Samuel 1), she dedicates her first-born son. According to this passage, her husband Elkanah could overturn Hannah’s vow when he learns of it (see
  <a href="#num30-12">
   v. 12

  The new husband is given the option to annul his bride’s vow even though he was not present when she first made it. However, if he does not annul it on the day he hears of it, the vow stands as is.

  A woman who falls into either of these two categories is not beholden to a man with regard to vows and oaths. She can act autonomously; she alone is responsible for fulfilling her vow or oath. Because the Hebrew Bible typically perceives the widow as one of the most vulnerable members of its society, it legally provides for the needs of widows with regard to food, clothing, and other protections. (See at
  <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-21">

   Further Discussion of a Married Woman’s Vow or Oath
  </i>
  (30:11–17)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-en">
  The text returns to cases of married women, to situations such as that of Hannah, who vows her (and her husband’s) hoped-for son before the child is conceived. We assume that Elkanah later acquiesces to the terms of his wife’s vow, since Hannah simply tells him that she will not part with her son until he is weaned. Elkanah agrees, saying, “As long as God’s word is fulfilled” (I Samuel 1:23). Young Samuel’s parents deliver him to the Shiloh sanctuary without a recorded discussion.

These include abstention from wine and grapes and refraining from contact with the dead (see
  <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_6.1-27">
   Numbers 6
  </a>
  ). [The language implies that the woman’s vow may include abstention from other activities as well, a behavior that might have repercussions for the husband, for example, if she takes a vow of celibacy. —

  The overarching purpose for these laws about vows is elucidated here. This passage is concerned with specifying the range of a woman’s power as it relates to her own religious life and with ensuring that her independence does not conflict with the needs or preferences of the male head of the household. The laws illustrate that a woman who is not divorced or widowed is considered under the authority of either her father or her husband with respect to vows or oaths, yet only under certain conditions can he limit her decisions as an individual making a vow.

  <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#D25-5">

  THE WAR AGAINST THE MIDIANITES (31:1–12)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  The following episode of vengeance is not unique to the Bible, but it is one of the few in which women are particularly targeted. Moses holds Midianite women responsible for enticing Israelite men into foreign worship and specifically demands their deaths. The vengeance against the Midianites raises questions. First, what is the position of Moses’ Midianite wife, Zipporah (
  <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E2-16">
   Exodus 2:21
  </a>
  ), in this conflict? Second,
  <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_25.1-9">
   Numbers 25
  </a>
  depicts Moabite, not Midianite, women as seducing Israelite men (
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#n25-12">
   25:12
  </a>
  ); why then is this a campaign against the Midianites? Finally, why is Balaam punished when in
  <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#n24">
   Numbers 24
  </a>
  he blesses, not curses, Israel? Contemporary scholars attribute the inconsistencies to the editors’ choice to weave together different sources or traditions.

  </i>
  The idiom throughout the Bible indicates death, presuming the usual practice of interment in the family tomb. Thus Jacob buries Leah in the tomb of his ancestors where he too expects to be buried (see
  <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#ge_49.28-33">

  </a>
  and at
  <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num25-6">

  ). King David’s aged supporter Barzillai the Gileadite expresses his preference to die “in my own town, near the graves of my father and mother” (II Samuel 19:38). In Moses’ case the idiom is a metaphor. This will be Moses’ final battle before he dies.

  <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_25.1-9">
   Numbers 25
  </a>
  with the mention of Balaam’s return home, he must have been involved in that apostasy (so Rashi, who follows the Talmud). Contemporary scholars explain the incongruence as a result of the combination of two versions of the story (see at
  <a href="#page_997">

  [Moses’ demand that all such women be killed is based on the women’s presumed culpability in the incident at Baal-peor.

  AFTERMATH: PURIFICATION RITUALS AND DISTRIBUTION OF SPOILS (31:19–54)
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Since taking of human life renders persons impure by putting them in contact with dead bodies, those responsible for the killing must undergo the purification ritual prescribed in detail in
  <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_19.1-22">
   Numbers 19
  </a>
  . This entails being sprinkled with a special mixture called “water of lustration” (“water of

  ; see at
  <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#n19-9">

  <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L17-11">
   Leviticus 17:11

  Heb.

  The word
  <i>
   niddah

  elsewhere refers to menstruation or a menstruating woman (see
  <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">
   Leviticus 15
  </a>
  ). Many scholars argue that no real connection exists between the water and the woman, other than that both refer to matters in the purity system. However, Hyam Maccoby asserts that the term should be translated literally as “waters of menstruation.” He claims that in a time predating the biblical period, menstrual blood was not only defiling but also maintained healing and purifying properties. Biblical examples of blood as a cleansing agent include the case of the
  <i>
   chatat
  </i>
  (“purgation offering”), in which blood is sprinkled on the altar in a purifying manner (see
  <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e29-35">

  </a>
  ;
  <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.22">
   Leviticus 4:25
  </a>
  ); but there the blood is that of a male animal sacrificed to God. Maccoby maintains that the red heifer is different from other biblical sacrifices in part because the heifer is a female sacrificial animal and in part because of its distinct coloring. The red cow is not just symbolic of blood in general, but of menstrual blood in particular, which has the symbolic power of life, death, and fertility (

  vows in this parashah invite readers to reflect on the most (in) famous story about vows in the Bible: that of Jephthah’s daughter. Her father, the warrior Jephthah, vows to sacrifice as a burnt offering the first thing to come out of his house should he win a particular battle (Judges 11:30–31). When his only child, his daughter, comes out dancing to greet him after his victory, Jephthah bemoans his (!) predicament. But far from challenging his rash vow, Jephthah’s unnamed daughter encourages him to fulfill it (Judges 11:36). Her only request is that she be allowed to spend two months alone with her female companions in order to “bewail [her] maidenhood” (Judges 11:38). Afterward, “he did to her as he had vowed” (Judges 11:39). The narrator concludes by noting that it became a custom for young Israelite women to gather annually for four days to chant dirges in the daughter’s memory (11:39–40). Tikva Frymer-Kensky suggests that no one in Israel would have viewed this death lightly. “Jephthah’s daughter is a pious and faithful woman who is remembered in cult and story” (“The Bible and Women’s Studies,”
  <i>
   Studies in the Bible and Feminist Criticism,
  </i>
  2006, p. 172). But what messages does her memory convey?

 <div class="tab-enin">
  A story about a rash oath by another father, King Saul, suggests a comparison. Saul takes an oath that whoever eats or drinks during a particular battle will be put to death (I Samuel 14:24). His son Jonathan inadvertently violates the oath (even ridiculing it when he learns of it afterward), and Saul commands that Jonathan be executed. Jonathan expresses his readiness to die (v. 44). The troops, however, protest and instead ransom Jonathan (v. 45). Although we do not know what such “ransom” entails, Jonathan’s life is spared.

  The two stories come from different settings and function as a critique within their context. Taken together, the stories of Jephthah’s daughter and of Jonathan also convey messages about community and protest. Jonathan’s story illustrates the power in community to discover ways to overturn rash pronouncements when it would cost a human life. Perhaps the legacy of Jephthah’s daughter resides in the formation of community that can protest. It begins with the women who gather annually and chant, making their voices heard.

  79a–b, 81b–82a), perhaps because these were things over which women had some control and which also gave them pleasure.

  was still under her father’s authority, even if she was not literally in her father’s home when she made the vow. The medieval French commentator Rashi comments that the phrase “by reason of her youth” excludes both a very young girl, whose vows have no legal force, and a young woman who has reached the age of majority. An adult woman is not under her father’s legal control, even if she is still living at home, and her father cannot annul her vows.

  79a–b restricts a husband’s power to annul his wife’s vows to those of self-denial or that have an impact on the marital relationship. Depending on the interpreter, the husband’s power of cancellation could be limited to vows that interfere with the couple’s sexual relationship or could include any vow that might cause contention in the marriage (Adin Steinsaltz on
  <i>
   N’darim
  </i>
  79b, citing R. Isaac DeTrani and R. Menachem Meiri). A vow to abstain from sexual intercourse could certainly be annulled by the husband.

  ). Since widows and divorcées are independent entities, no one is in a position to annul their vows. According to BT
  <i>
   Gittin
  </i>
  79b, if a husband had annulled his wife’s vows that had a negative impact on the marital relationship, the woman is obligated to fulfill those vows should she become a divorcée or widow. Once vows purely of self-denial have been annulled, however, they are cancelled permanently.

  4:7 discusses a husband’s decision to divorce his wife due to her vows, while BT

 <div class="tab-enin">
  The discussion of women’s vows in
  <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#n29-39">
   Numbers 30
  </a>
  indicates that women are, in principle, capable of making and fulfilling vows. The restrictions on the vows of a minor daughter or wife in no way negate this ability. Rather, the laws recognize a certain understanding of the father-daughter and husband-wife relationship, one in which the man has a significant amount of power over the woman. This power is tempered, at least in a marital relationship, by rabbinic legislation. Mishnah
  <i>
   K’tubot 7:1–5
  </i>
  teaches that a husband who makes vows that compromise his wife’s ability to eat certain foods or wear jewelry, to visit her family or attend social functions, or who upholds his wife’s own vows of self-denial for a lengthy period of time should divorce her, since his actions make her life uncomfortable.

  <i>

  7, criticize the request of the Reubenites and the Gadites. They note that the tribes speak of providing shelter for their flocks before mentioning their children, an indication that they loved their possessions more than their families. Moses hints at their need to rethink their priorities; in his reply, he reverses the order, instructing them to “build towns for your children and [then] sheepfolds for your flocks” (
  <a href="#n32-24">

  <i>

  5, their inordinate love of possessions is what led these tribes to live outside of the land of Israel; as a result, they were exiled from their land before the other tribes (I Chronicles 5:26).

  been amazed by the power of Kol Nidrei, the prayer that introduces the evening service on Yom Kippur. Each year, I marvel at the sheer number of people who put aside all other commitments in order to be in synagogue, to be present to hear these ancient words. What brings us in the doors? Is it the haunting melody? Is it the threefold repetition of the prayer that moves us toward an emotional crescendo? Or is it the message of this prayer, which promises to absolve us of our responsibility for any vows that we may make in the coming year?
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  When we make vows, we put into speech our deepest fears and most profound hopes. Like Hannah who vows to dedicate her son to the sanctuary if God grants her a son (I Samuel 1:11), many of us make various commitments to do certain things or give up certain things that we cherish, in order to avert danger or bring about a hoped-for future. Yet some vows are rash, regrettable, or unrealizable; some are made under duress. Kol Nidrei reminds us that we have the choice to keep or annul our vows, thus affirming our most basic rights to self-expression and self-determination. This is part of what gives both the prayer and its recitation its profound power.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  <i>
   Parashat Matot
  </i>
  enumerates various regulations concerning the status of women’s vows (
  <a href="#num_30.2-17">
   30:3–17
  </a>
  ). It also describes the circumstances under which a woman’s vow may be annulled. We read that if her father or husband hears the vow on the day that she makes it, the vow can be nullified. The woman’s personal status—whether she is a child, married, or divorced—will determine the status and power of the vow and whether she may fulfill it. Although she possesses the ability to make a vow, she may have to abandon her oaths and vows if the male authority figure in her life hears them. Given that fact, what are her options? She could take her chances with vowing and being heard. Or, to avoid her vow being annulled, she might either choose not to take on the responsibility involved in making an oath or a vow, or she might opt to make her vow but without anyone hearing her; in both of these options, she would be forced to follow, and be complicit in maintaining, the culture’s attitude toward her desire for personal expression. She herself thus participates in her own silencing, because only by vowing without being heard, will she fulfill the mandate that her vow establishes. She acts by pretending that she has not acted. She can transgress the restrictions only by forcing herself to take part in them at the same time. She must betray herself to be true to herself.

  While we think we are free from these kinds of constraints, this is often not quite true. As mothers, when we chose to take emotional and physical care of our children, we voluntarily relinquish the freedom we might have enjoyed at an earlier time. Similarly, we may accept professional positions that do not sufficiently reflect our capabilities, in order to be available to support a beloved spouse, partner, or aging parent. We may not explicitly associate such situations with vow making or breaking, but in a certain important way, the relationship to vows exists. Like vow-making in the Bible, women’s aspirations, spoken or not, are promises we make, even if only to ourselves. When we give them up because of external pressures, we pay a price.

 <div class="tab-enin">
  On the one hand, we live in a time when, as women, we are blessedly free from the kind of controls that Numbers prescribes. On the other hand, we find ourselves within a web of relationships where we often give up what we had promised to ourselves, or
  <a id="page_1009">
  </a>
  we redirect our abilities. The stereotype of the Jewish mother may represent, in some ways, a woman’s efforts to take power through the very vehicles that entrap her—by making a nice home, cooking gourmet meals, and having successful children.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  Some may see these concessions as choices; others may see them as abandonment of self. We want to fulfill our responsibilities and live up to our expectations as spouses, mothers, and daughters; but we also want to be heard, to play an active role in our communities, to see ourselves and to be seen as powerful. We are aware that our culture could not survive if we sometimes did not voluntarily place our own needs as secondary. Yet, we are not always aware of the price some of us pay for that choice.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  We see in our society rising rates of depression, eating disorders, premature sexuality, and self-destructive behaviors. A 2002 report of the American Psychological Association indicates that of the 17 million Americans who suffer from depression yearly, “women are twice as likely as men to experience a major depressive episode. Depression may occur at any age during a woman’s life with certain events like puberty, pregnancy, perimenopause, trauma, substance abuse and quality of relationships.” The report also notes that current research shows that women typically “place their needs secondary to those of others.” One cannot simplistically attribute depression to a single cause, but it is difficult not to wonder to what extent the thwarting of one’s longings and hopes, either by implicit social pressures or explicit ones, plays a role.
 </div>
 <div class="tab-enin">
  How can we can stimulate and support, rather than stifle, women who long to fulfill their ambitions and dreams, so that their vows to themselves—and others—can become a reality? As a Jewish community we are still working on answers to such questions, both in the personal and institutional realms. We no longer need to be complicit in the denial and abandonment of self that pervades our culture. Instead, we can speak honestly and openly about our lives and our choices. No longer must we voice our desires in an undertone, hoping that no one will hear. Instead, we can search to find—whether in studying the Torah or participating in the world—the truth of our lives that will help us to find the truth in God’s teachings, so that we can live in a more just relationship with our loved ones and with our God.
