<div class="noindent"><span class="dropcap"><img alt="images" src="../Images/pg_xxxi.jpg"/></span> T<small>HIS COMMENTARY INVITES</small> the reader to meet the Torah text on new terms and to read the text through new eyes. In addition to more traditional modes of interpretation, this <i>Commentary</i> includes poetry, an innovative mode of expanding and extending the Torah text. In the Voices section at the conclusion of each parashah, we have collected poetry, along with selected prose pieces, to invite you to consider how issues and themes in each Torah portion reflect and illuminate women’s lives and experiences. This essay will explore the intention and the process of collecting the poems included in this volume.</div>
<div class="fmhead"><i><b>Poetry and the Oral Tradition</b></i></div>
<div class="noindent">The Torah is a living document. While some contemporary Jews may think of the Torah as a static, fixed “book,” the Torah has always been read aloud or chanted as an essential part of weekly, Shabbat, and holiday synagogue ritual. This declamatory aspect of Torah reading invites response, and the rich history of Torah commentary has developed from and continues to depend upon listeners’ familiarity with the oral text. Public reading brings together the intensely personal encounter with sacred text with the shared experience of hearing the text chanted or read aloud. Mirroring the communal experience of prayer, which, for Jews, always frames the public reading of Torah, each person is challenged to listen with concentrated attention: both as a member of the community and as an individual, hearing the words each time as if for the first time.</div>
<div class="indent">Poetry, too, demands oral recitation. By complementing each Torah portion with poetry, we are continuing the oral tradition of intentional listening and of challenging the “listener” to make connections between the text and your own life through the medium of commentary—in this case, in the form of poetry. As the poet Adrienne Rich writes, “What poetry is made of is so old, so familiar, that it’s easy to forget that it’s not just the words.” Rather, “every poem breaks a silence that had to be overcome.” Furthermore, “in the wash of poetry, the old, beaten, worn stones of language take on colors.” But these “colors,” or meanings, may also “disappear when you sieve them up out of the streambed and try to sort them out” <i>(What Is Found There: Notebooks on Poetry and Politics,</i> 1993, p. 84). This is the challenge of poetry.</div>

<div class="fmhead"><i><b>The Challenges and Pleasures of Poetry</b></i></div>
<div class="noindent">For many readers, poetry is a particularly demanding medium. Whether deprived of teachers who welcomed us into the rich and exciting world of poetic language, or bored as children by memorizing poetry that seemed to have no meaning or relevance, some of us draw away from a poem that meets us on the page, hesitating, perhaps even ashamed of what we misinterpret as our lack of skills to approach or unpack the poem. Perhaps we hesitate to approach poetry because we feel the poem beckoning and we are unsure how to respond. The poet Muriel Rukeyser writes, “A poem does invite, it does require. What does it invite? A <a id="page_lxi"></a>poem invites you to feel. More than that: it invites you to respond. And better than that: a poem invites a total response” (<i>The Life of Poetry,</i> 1996, p. 11). When we move beyond our fears, we can begin to respond to the poem—and to the Torah.</div>
<div class="indent">The Voices section invites you to give poetry a chance, to open your heart to the invitation to feel, to hear, to respond. We invite you to read each poem once, and then again, silently and aloud. Each reading will reveal new sounds, new meanings, new insights. Share your reading, and your interpretations with others. How does the poem illuminate the Torah text? How does the Torah text illuminate the poem? How does the poem serve as midrash, providing a deeper or broader reading of the text? If a poem is not immediately clear or understood, return to it at a later point. Read it again. Discuss the poem with your study partner, your friends, your teachers. In most cases we include references to verses in the Torah that we consider relevant to the poem; elsewhere we omit these because the poem relates to the parashah as a whole. Give each poem an opportunity to speak to you, opening a powerful and fresh perspective into the timeless Torah text. You may be surprised and delighted with your response.</div>
<div class="fmhead"><i><b>Poetry and Women’s Experience</b></i></div>
<div class="noindent">Since ancient times, women have collected and recorded their stories, their dreams, their fears, and their hopes. While their fathers and brothers may have bent over sacred texts, women composed songs and poems to welcome new life, to celebrate weddings, to mourn the dead. Some of these works were passed down from mother to daughter, orally or in writing. While some compositions were preserved, other writings—like many precious belongings—were lost as our people wandered from continent to continent, changing location, language, and worldview.</div>
<div class="indent">Women’s poetry begins in the Torah, with the Song of Miriam (<a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">Exodus 15:20-21</a>), perhaps even the Song at the Sea (see at <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.1-21">Exodus 15:1–19</a>). Several other biblical poems are associated with women, namely the Song of Deborah (Judges 5), the Song of Hannah (I Samuel 2) and most of Song of Songs; and women were known to compose and perform victory songs and laments (see the <a href="56_chapter_53.xhtml#page_1251">introduction to <i>parashat Haazinu</i></a>). However, we know of few writings by Jewish women between ancient times and the 16th century, when Deborah Ascarelli composed and translated liturgy for her community in Rome. In the next century, Gluckel of Hameln composed her memoirs and Sarah Copio Sullam wrote poetry for her family and friends in Venice. Another kind of poetic text that has been preserved are numerous <i>tkhines,</i> petitionary prayers, some of which were written by women, including Rebecca Tiktiner of Prague (16th century) and Sarah daughter of Tovim of Podolia, Ukraine (18th century). For many years, these prayers served as a primary liturgical resource for many women, particularly for those whose language skills did not include Hebrew. In the wake of the Haskalah (the so-called Jewish Enlightenment, beginning in the late 18th century), we begin to see published works and essays by women, including poetry, first by Rachel Morpurgo in Trieste (1790–1871; see <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#page_964"><i>Balak,</i> Voices</a>), Grace Aguilar (1816–1847) in Britain, and Penina Moise (1797–1880) and Emma Lazarus (1849–1887) in the United States, among others. These poets made their voices heard by a wider audience, writing primarily in their native tongues. (See <i>The JPS Guide to Jewish Women: 600 BCE—1900 CE,</i> edited by Emily Taitz, Sondra Henry, and Cheryl Tallan, 2003.) Although considerably limited in quantity, women’s diaries, <i>tkhines,</i> memoirs, and poetry form a parallel tradition to the rich body of codes, commentary, and discursive literature composed by Jewish men throughout the ages.</div>
<div class="indent">The poetry collected in this <i>Commentary’s</i> Voices section reflects the writings of Jewish women <a id="page_lxii"></a>across a wide chronological and geographical span. Whereas some poems date back as far as the 17th century, the majority were written in the last half century, largely by American, Israeli, and European poets. Although all the poetry in this volume appears in English, many poems have been translated from Hebrew, Yiddish, German, Russian, and other languages. The poets include both well-known, award-winning poets, as well as new, emerging poets. While a number of the poems were written as responses to specific parts of the Torah, others were not. In fact, many of the poets included in this volume were surprised and delighted to discover their work being juxtaposed as Torah commentary. A poem is the poet’s gift to the world; once released from the pen, the words enter hearts and minds in ways that the poet might never have dreamed or imagined. The wide range of poetry in this volume reflects the elasticity, the expansiveness, and the timelessness of a Torah that is open to continued and continual interpretation.</div>
<div class="fmhead"><i><b>The Process</b></i></div>
<div class="noindent">In keeping with the larger goals of this <i>Commentary,</i> the Voices section contains poems that, in some way, illuminate the experience of Jewish women as participants in, readers of, and heirs to the Torah and biblical history. The poems in Voices add depth to the four other types of commentary in each parashah by complementing, strengthening, and opening new readings of each portion. The poems fill in some of the lacunae of the biblical text by considering questions such as: Who were the women of the Bible? What might have they thought about and felt? What were the nature and the boundaries of their relationships with other women, with the men in their lives, with their children, and with their neighbors? When no women are mentioned in a story, where <i>are</i> the women? Who might they have been? While some of the poems give voice to the experiences and emotions of women mentioned in the Torah, others address broader topics and themes raised explicitly or implicitly in a given parashah, such as approaching the holy, sexual awakening, risk taking, creating and sustaining families and communities, pregnancy and childbirth, infertility, loss and mourning, and more.</div>
<div class="indent">For the other four sections that accompany each parashah, contributors were invited to write for this volume. In contrast, the Voices section was assembled by a small working group made up of the Editors (Tamara Cohn Eskenazi and Andrea L. Weiss), two members of the Editorial Board (Sherry Blumberg and Sue Levi Elwell), the Managing Editor (Hara Person), the Project Coordinator (Barbara Koppel), and our Rabbinic Student Interns (Jocelyn Hudson and Leah Berkowitz). Because our group included women who lived across the United States, we conducted our work on the telephone through conference calls, often meeting once a week for two hours at a time. This diverse group included women of different ages and diverse journeys. We discovered that we brought to our conversations a rich range of Jewish women’s experiences—as daughter, sister, friend, beloved, partner, mother of children by birth and by adoption, grandmother, and widow. The poetry that we considered challenged, comforted, and changed us. We hope you will share those experiences.</div>
<div class="indent">As we started gathering potential Voices material, we cast a wide net. We read widely, networking with poets, writers, teachers of literature, and our own friends and colleagues, sharing favorite books and poets, and spending countless hours in the stacks of libraries and bookstores and on the Internet. We found ample material for the narrative portions of the Torah; other genres presented a greater challenge.</div>
<div class="indent">As we evaluated material, we asked: How might a woman’s perspective enable us to ask new questions of the Torah? How are our understandings of <a id="page_lxiii"></a>gender and sexuality challenged by biblical texts, and how might biblical text be challenged by our growing understandings of these topics? What is the message of this poem, and how does it intersect with the biblical text? How far can we push the text, and also push each poem? What happens when we read and interpret familiar signs and symbols in new and powerfully different ways? How does an innovative reading of the text make that text more accessible and meaningful for contemporary readers?</div>
<div class="indent">During our phone calls, we read the selections aloud and discussed whether they merited inclusion and, if so, where they might fit. As our process continued, our understanding of our task deepened. We aimed to find, or, when necessary, commission or compose, poems that could act as spotlights on different aspects of each parashah. We hoped that together, these poems would reveal several distinct points of entry into each Torah portion. Additionally, for each parashah we attempted to balance poems that readers might find more accessible with those that might prove more challenging and require greater interpretive effort.</div>
<div class="indent">The Torah, which weaves together narrative, law, and song, is our people’s essential poetic expression. It calls to each of us, inviting attention and response. Poetry is a resource for facing challenges. As Muriel Rukeyser writes, “In this moment when we face horizons and conflicts wider than ever before, we want our resources, the ways of strength. We look again to the human wish, its faiths, the means by which the imagination leads us to surpass ourselves. If there is a feeling that something has been lost, it may be because much has not yet been used, much is still to be found and begun” <i>(The Life of Poetry,</i> 1996, p. 8). The time has come for all of us to hear women’s songs that echo, respond to, and challenge the themes of our ancient texts: celebrating the victory of the human spirit, crying out with the pain of loss, reflecting upon the quiet joy, and feeling the ecstasy of standing in the presence of holiness. Rukeyser observes that “much is still to be found and begun.” The Voices sections begin this process of restoring, renewing, and invigorating the study of—and delight in—the Torah of poetry and the poetry of Torah. May these poems open paths of insight and joy.</div>
