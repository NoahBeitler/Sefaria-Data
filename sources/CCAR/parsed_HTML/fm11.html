<div class="noindent"><span class="dropcap-s">T</span><small>HE INVITATION CAME</small> during the week of <i>parashat Vayeira.</i> At the time, I had been struggling with a <i>d’var Torah</i> I was preparing for the monthly board of trustees meeting at my synagogue. The central story of that portion is <i>Akedat Yitzchak,</i> the binding and near sacrifice of Isaac (<a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G22-1">Genesis 22:1-19</a>). As I thought about the horrifying image of Abraham with arm uplifted against his son, I suddenly thought about Sarah. For the very first time, it occurred to me that Sarah was part of this story, that her feelings and her reactions mattered, that if she had been asked to sacrifice her child, the story might have ended right there. I realized that in her absence and her silence there was room for commentary; therefore, I accepted the invitation to be the Scholar-in-Residence for the 1992 District 3 National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods (NFTS; now Women of Reform Judaism) biennial convention as a way to further explore Sarah’s experience.</div>
<div class="indent">As I began my research, I soon found that I was not the first to think about the silent women of our tradition. I discovered that there were women—and men—at work in diverse fields of study who were uncovering and recovering a far more complex understanding of the ancient world than the Torah narrative suggests. Their work was opening the door to restoring a sense of women’s presence at the most important moments of our history and in our most sacred text. In various settings and circumstances, these individuals were beginning to add to and expand Torah.</div>
<div class="indent">I was awed and overwhelmed by the scholarship and creative work going on in all parts of the Jewish world. However, I realized that there was no organized, cohesive way in which to access this groundbreaking work. It occurred to me that the time had come to gather the best minds of our generation, to apply all that they had researched and discovered, all that they could now interpret and imagine, to create an egalitarian commentary to the Torah, a volume that would allow women, as well as men, to find themselves in the pages of the sacred text of our people.</div>
<div class="indent">I first issued the charge at the 1992 District 3 NFTS convention and repeated it at the NFTS National Biennial Assembly in San Francisco in 1993. The <i>Commentary</i> you now hold in your hands is WRJ’s response to that challenge. What follows is an excerpt from my presentation, “Sarah’s Hidden Voice: Recovering and Discovering Women’s Spirituality”:</div>
<div class="indent">“In every generation, our people have turned to the Torah to seek answers to their needs, their problems, their contemporary challenges. We are here today, in large measure, because the Torah has yielded meaning and truth to every generation that has sought its wisdom. We can do no less. It is our responsibility to make this book live for us. As men have done throughout the centuries, we must stretch the words, we must invest them with our needs and our imagination. We must struggle with the plain sense of stories, laws, and attitudes that exclude, de-value, and indict women. We must incorporate women’s history and women’s experience as part of the living memory of the Jewish people.</div>
<div class="indent">“The past fifteen years have seen an explosion of scholarship and creative work that will help us do this.…The work that feminist scholars are doing is changing our assumptions and conceptions of the world out of which Judaism emerged.…What <a id="page_xxviii"></a>is so important about this understanding is that it gives us a sense that there is much to uncover and recover in our history that speaks to us directly as women and restores to us a sense of our presence in and at the most important moments in our history. This insight also encourages us to proceed with this process of adding to and expanding Torah, of building upon the intimations that peek through the patriarchal gloss of the text, of prodding our communal memory and inventing what we have forgotten, of remembering and inventing together in order to recover the hidden half of Torah, reshape Jewish memory, and allow women to speak. [See Judith Plaskow, <i>Standing Again at Sinai,</i> 1990, p. 56, who quotes Monique Wittig’s novel <i>Les Guerilleres:</i> “You say you have lost all recollection of it, remember.…Make an effort to remember. Or, failing that, invent.”]…</div>
<div class="indent">“I present this final charge to you not as a theoretical proposal of something women ideally ought to do and somehow will be accomplished ‘out there’ by women rabbis and scholars. I present this idea of re-claiming Torah as a very specific proposal to this great gathering of Jewish women, to this unique organization dedicated to the spiritual life and religious empowerment of Reform Jewish women. If we are really serious about women’s spirituality, about re-claiming our history and our voices, about liberating the concepts of God and community, of integrating the Torah of our tradition into the Torah of our lives [a concept that I learned from Rabbi Laura Geller], then there is something very concrete that we can do. We can commission the creation of the first women’s commentary to the Torah!”</div>
<div class="indent">Since my first encounter with Women of Reform Judaism in 1979 (when they were still NFTS), I have been awed by the power of this organization and the ability of the women who lead it. I am profoundly grateful to every member of WRJ for undertaking this project with courage and resolve, with an understanding of its potential to transform our tradition, with willingness to embrace a dream and make it a reality. Working together, women have funded, designed, researched, written, edited, and critiqued this unprecedented volume. We have done all of this in historic fashion: a woman’s voice inspired a community of women to undertake this project in which women scholars, rabbis, cantors, teachers and poets bring their voices, their unique perspective to the ancient text of our overwhelmingly patriarchal tradition. This extraordinary volume, the result of the efforts of so many, is a veritable symphony of women’s voices—beautiful, powerful, inspirational, transformative.</div>
<div class="indent">As we open these pages, with excitement and anticipation, we hear the sound of Sarah’s laughter, triumphant: “My daughters have discovered me, my children have given me new life and new hope. I am reborn for a future as infinite and as radiant as the stars in the heavens of God’s promise to Abraham and me, to Isaac and Rebecca, to Jacob, Rachel, and Leah, and to <i>all</i> of our descendants.”</div>
