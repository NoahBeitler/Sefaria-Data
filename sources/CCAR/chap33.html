   (“my laws”) concludes Leviticus, a book devoted to instructing the people of Israel how to conduct their lives in keeping with their status as God’s people. The first part of the parashah seeks to ensure obedience to these instructions by providing strong motivation in the form of a series of blessings and curses. God, through Moses, promises the people prosperity and peace if they follow the path laid out by God; and God threatens them with famine, war, and eventually exile, if they choose to spurn God’s laws and commandments (
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_26.3-46">
    26:3–46
   </a>
   ). The second part of the parashah (
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_27.1-34">
    27:1–34
   </a>
   ) is an appendix that addresses issues related to communal funding, especially of the priesthood and of the sanctuary.

   Explicit information about women in these passages, while scant, does shed some additional light on their status and the nature of their household responsibilities in ancient Israel. Especially significant for our understanding of the status of women in this culture is the material in
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_27.1-34">
    27:3–7
   </a>
   , which lists monetary equivalents for the worth of individuals whose services are vowed to the temple. Leviticus, we learn, bases these assessments and values on a combination of the factors of age and gender (see also
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#page_780">

   </a>
   ).

   In addition, the content of
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_27.25">
    27:1–25
   </a>
   , which deals with vows and gifts of property to the temple, touches upon several other issues that relate to the lives of women in ancient Israel, such as whose vows were binding and under what conditions, who could partake in the priests’ portion of sacrificial animals (a major source of food for priests and their households), and who could inherit and possess property. While
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_27.1-34">
    Leviticus 27
   </a>
   does not directly deal with these issues, all of them are crucial for those wishing to understand the significance of the instruction in this text for women in ancient Israel.

God addresses the Israelites who are about to enter the Promised Land, assuring them of great rewards if they follow God’s instructions, and threatening them with a series of increasingly severe punishments if they disobey. The laws pertain to women and men together as a community. The rewards and the punishments are symmetrical: the punishments reverse each of the promised rewards via a contrasting threat. For example, a promise of fertility of the land (vv. 4–5 and 10) contrasts with the threat of a barren and fruitless land (vv. 16, 19–20). The symmetry, among other things, expresses a balanced and ordered universe, a theme that is important in priestly writings (see
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis 1
   </a>
   ). These blessings and curses resemble those that conclude Deuteronomy’s laws (
   <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_28.1-68">
    Deuteronomy 28–30
   </a>
   ) and many ancient Near Eastern treaties. In all of these instances, the curses section tends to be much longer and more detailed than the blessings section, most likely to frighten the hearers into obedience through the threat of divine enforcement.

   Spurning (or rejecting) is something of a leitmotif in this unit. First, God promises never to spurn Israel if the people follow the laws and commandments (v. 11). Next, if the people choose to spurn these laws and commandments (v. 15), the punishments will begin. Finally, God will spurn Israel temporarily should the people fail to return to God after a series of increasingly severe punishments (

   CURSES FOR DISOBEDIENCE (26:14–45)

  <div class="tab-enin">
   In contrast to the rather brief section of blessings, the list of curses is longer and more detailed. It threatens Israel with the consequences that will follow if the people spurn God’s rules and fail to observe God’s laws. The curses in
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_26.3-46">
    Leviticus 26:14–45

   largely mirror the blessings in the previous section and also have many similarities to the curses in
   <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu_28.1-68">
    Deuteronomy 28:15–68
   </a>
   . However, in Deuteronomy the curses appear as punishment, while here they are presented also as God’s attempt to influence the people to return to the right path (see
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_26.3-46">
    vv. 18

      ten women shall bake your bread in a single oven.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Many women will all share one oven, whether for lack of dough or for lack of wood to fuel the oven. Either way, the threat is that of famine. Variations on this theme are common in ancient Near Eastern curses. For example, a curse in the Aramaic Sefire inscription (mid-8th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   ) reads: “And may his seven daughters bake bread in an oven but not fill it”; and a curse in the bilingual Assyrian-Aramaic Tell Fekheriyeh inscription (9th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   ) reads, “May a hundred women bake bread in an oven and not fill it.”
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   [It appears that ovens were beehive-shaped forms, made of a mixture of chopped clay and straw, sometimes with broken shards pressed onto the oven. They could be slightly recessed into the ground. (See P. King and L. Stager,
   <i>
    Life in Biblical Israel,
   </i>
   2001, p. 67.) They were generally in the courtyard and probably served several adjacent dwellings. But they could also be in interior space; a baker would more likely fire up an interior oven in cold rainy weather. The bread could be baked on a baking tray, set over the fire inside the oven. —
   <i>
    Ed
   </i>
   ] Oven fuel consisted of branches or dung (see Malachi 3:19; Jacob Milgrom,
   <i>
    Leviticus 23–27,
   </i>
   2001, p. 2314).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Here the text specifies women as the ones who bake the bread. This provides some insight into the division of labor in the ancient Israelite household. While women were the ones responsible for childbearing and childrearing, they also divided with men the other duties necessary to sustain and support the household. This text, then, provides evidence that women were predominantly responsible for tasks related to food production, that is, the transformation of raw foodstuffs into consumable goods. In the ancient world this was a very important and time-consuming task. Other biblical texts, through their association of women and food production in various forms, support this conclusion. For example, in I Samuel 28:24, the medium of En-dor prepares a calf and makes bread for King Saul. In Jeremiah 7:17–18, women are described as kneading dough for cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. In 1 Samuel 8:13, the prophet Samuel warns the people that monarchy will make many demands of them, including that the king “will take your daughters as perfumers, cooks, and bakers.” This last text implies that women indeed served those functions at the royal palace, as well as in ordinary households.

    </b>
   </i>
   The horrific prospect of cannibalism as a result of siege, extreme famine, or both is a recurrent theme in Israelite and other ancient Near Eastern curses. An extreme version of this theme appears in II Kings 6:28–29, when a king in besieged and famine-struck Samaria must decide between two women who had agreed to eat their respective children, first one and then the other, to stave off starvation. A conflict erupts when, after having shared in eating the first woman’s child, the second mother hides her son. (The story is an ironic twist on the episode in which King Solomon demonstrates his superb wisdom by determining which harlot is the rightful mother of a baby; see I Kings 3:16–28.) In Lamentations 2:20 and 4:10, references to women desperate enough to eat their own children show how terrible the situation for the people of Judah has become. In both of these texts, the image of women eating their children exemplifies a crisis so severe that it reverses even the maternal instinct: instead of being willing to sacrifice everything—even themselves—for their children, these mothers sacrifice their children in the most horrific way possible, so that they may live. The image is that of a world turned tragically upside down by the horrors of wartime siege and famine.

      I will destroy your cult places and cut down your incense stands.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Biblical references use neutral terms for cult places (sometimes translated as “high places”) or local shrines in early stages of Israelite life but criticize these for the period after the building of the temple in Jerusalem (in the 10th or 9th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   ). For example, I Kings 22:44 and II Kings 15:35 mention people worshiping God at such high places; that author does not approve of the practice yet apparently tolerates it. More so than men, women most likely depended on local shrines to enable them to participate in communal events. (They probably also had home shrines.) The Bible—and probably the Israelites in general—apparently considered worship of God at these local shrines to be a legitimate religious outlet until centralization of worship at the Temple began to be enforced (see at
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu_12.1-16.17">
    Deuteronomy 12:2–14
   </a>
   ). The Bible suggests that this centralization began around the 7th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   , in the reigns of King Hezekiah and, later, Josiah. The Bible associates worship at local shrines after that time with idolatry, regardless of who was worshiped there.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Centralization of worship probably had a huge impact on women, who would have been less able than men were to leave their families and their domestic and reproductive responsibilities in order to travel to Jerusalem. Once the worship of God at local shrines ceased to be legitimate, women lost important communal religious practices. When the Bible mentions women’s worship from the period of the monarchy on, it mostly categorizes it as worship of false deities, probably considered noteworthy because such practices undermined the central sanctuary. See, for example, the association of women with the worship of Asherah (I Kings 15:13 = II Chronicles 15:16; I Kings 18:19; and II Kings 23:4); references to female worship of the Queen of Heaven (Jeremiah 7:18 and 44:15–25); and women weeping for Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14). From an Israelite woman’s perspective, many of these practices were probably traditional and legitimate (see women’s defense of the worship in Jeremiah 44).

   his last of Leviticus specifies how to make various dedications to the sanctuary, how their value is determined, and whether they can be redeemed (that is, whether a monetary substitute is acceptable). These details supplement the laws about sacrifices with which the book began (
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    Leviticus 1–7
   </a>
   ). [Monetary valuation may also be related to the redemption laws of
   <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.1">
    Leviticus 25
   </a>
   in that, like “actuary tables,” they help estimate what redemption costs might entail. —

   Vows are essentially conditional promises to God, to be fulfilled if and when the requested conditions come to pass. According to biblical portrayals, one is most likely to utter a vow at a time of great distress, when direct appeal to God seems the only option left. A person often promises to dedicate or sacrifice an animal; but sometimes one offers service to the shrine, either by oneself or one’s child, such as in the case of Hannah (I Samuel 1:1–11), who promises God that if granted a son, she will dedicate his service to the sanctuary at Shiloh. The warrior Jephthah vows to sacrifice what comes from his house; it turns out to be his daughter (Judges 11:29–40; see at
   <a href="45_chapter_42.xhtml#num_30.2-17">
    Numbers 30:10
   </a>
   ). As an act of individual piety or desperation, one could utter a vow anywhere; therefore, vows were a popular form of religious devotion, one in which women could participate freely. (See additional references to women making vows in
   <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_6.1-27">
    Numbers 6:2
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="45_chapter_42.xhtml#num_30.2-17">
    30:4–17
   </a>
   ; Jeremiah 44:15–25; and Proverbs 31:2.)

    Leviticus 27
   </a>
   opens with instructions concerning the fulfillment of vows. There is evidence that at certain periods vows could be fulfilled at any sanctuary. In I Samuel 1–2, Hannah appeals to God at the sanctuary at Shiloh, and that is where she brings her son Samuel for the vowed service. However, at some point the priesthood set limitations regarding whose vows were binding, what one could promise, and where payment could be made. Often these regulations limited the ability of women to make and keep vows. According to
   <a href="45_chapter_42.xhtml#num_30.2-17">
    Numbers 30:10
   </a>
   , vows made by independent women, whether divorcées or widows, are binding. However, the vow of a woman who is under a male’s authority can be annulled by that father or husband upon first hearing of it (
   <a href="45_chapter_42.xhtml#num_30.2-17">
    Numbers 30:4–9
   </a>

Carol Meyers suggests that the Leviticus valuation may accurately reflect the relative potential for economic productivity of each gender at various stages of life (see below) and does not reflect a notion that men are inherently more valuable than women. A high mortality rate is also no doubt a factor. Carol Meyers reports that skeletal remains in some ancient tombs help to determine mortality rates among different age and gender groups in ancient Israel. These remains indicate that the death rate was highest among the pre-adult population. In one tomb group, for example, nearly half the population did not survive to the age of 18 (“The Roots of Restriction: Women in Early Israel,” 1978, p. 95).

Thus, instead of using the services of the vowed person, the priests can use the money, presumably for the maintenance of the sanctuary. The option of dedicating materials to the sanctuary not only seeks to fill a vower’s personal need but also provides resources for maintaining the national sanctuary—including its personnel, especially priests (see also

   There is some biblical evidence that men, at least, were considered to be most productive between twenty to sixty years of age. The book of Numbers legislates military conscription at twenty (

    Numbers 1:3

   The calculated 30 shekels for a woman in this category, when compared with 50 shekels for the male, places the woman’s relative economic worth in this age category at 38% of the total contribution of both genders. As Meyers notes, sociological studies show that when women contribute 40% to the economy’s productive labor, their status is at its highest. Their status diminishes if their contribution is higher (“Procreation, Production, and Protection: Male-Female Balance in Early Israel,” 1983, pp. 569–93, especially p. 575). See further

   The relative valuation of females in comparison with males is lowest in the five to twenty age group (for the female, 33% of the total contribution of both genders). Meyers observes that this period coincides with peak childbearing years, when women, occupied with childbearing and childrearing, could not provide as much in the way of other economic productivity. In addition, the fact that many women died in childbirth would also explain a devaluation of women’s economic worth relative to men in this age group.

   This flexibility allows poor people who wish to make dedications of this kind to the sanctuary even if they cannot afford the listed amounts. The sacrificial system incorporates similar concessions to the poor (see

   The next section concerns two categories of animal offerings: those that are fit for sacrifice (vv. 9–10) and those that are not (vv. 11–13). Once a sacrificable animal is pledged, it must be brought in to fulfill the vow and cannot be replaced by another animal. However, a pledged animal that is unfit for sacrifice because it is ritually impure (see
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_11.1-47">
    Leviticus 11
   </a>

Verses 12–13 of that passage determine that she is entitled to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations so long as she is part of his household. If she marries a member of the priesthood, her entitlement then derives from her husband. If she marries outside the priesthood, she becomes part of the lay community and thus loses her entitlement to partake of the sacred donations. However, if she is then widowed or divorced without children, and thus has no claim to her husband’s estate, she can go back to her father’s household and regain her entitlement to partake of her father’s portion of the sacred donations.

   This section treats three types of property pledges: dwellings (vv. 14–15), personal land holdings (vv. 16–20), and acquired land (vv. 22–25). Personal landholdings, that is, parcels of farmland, are assessed at a fixed rate according to how much seed it takes to plant them, which probably measures their size rather than how much the land has produced. The assessed value also depends on the timing of the jubilee (see
   <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
    25:29–34

   ), decreasing every year as the jubilee approaches. Several biblical texts mention women’s holding land, including Zelophehad’s daughters, Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah (see at

Presumably a female landholder could consecrate land to the sanctuary.

    HE CONCLUDING UNIT
   </small>
   of Leviticus concerns the economic support base, in the form of vowed resources, for ancient Israel’s central shrine. The first set of such votary pledges,
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_27.1-34">
    Leviticus 27:2–8
   </a>
   , involves the equivalence in silver of persons according to categories of gender and age, with separate assessments listed for females and males in four age groups. Because of the greater monetary values assigned to males in each age category, scholars have sometimes understood this table of valuations as an expression of gender bias, with females considered inherently less valuable than males.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   However, many commentators now understand that this table relates mainly to labor potential rather than to intrinsic worth. The highest monetary values appear for persons of ages twenty to sixty; such people would be considered mature adults, given the fact that biblical census texts list males of age twenty and above (namely, those who might be conscripted into military service; see
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#num_1.1-54">
    Numbers 1:3
   </a>
   ). That the youngest age category is that of one- to five-year-olds can be explained by presuming that ancient Israel was like many premodern agrarian societies in expecting children of very young ages to perform simple household tasks. Perhaps because of average differences in physical strength, women or girls were deemed to have a lower productive capacity than males of the same age, and thus
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_27.1-34">
    Leviticus 27
   </a>
   assigns them a somewhat lower valuation in all categories.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The differential shekel values attached to females and males provide an insight into the labor patterns in Israelite households and the associated status of women. The best way to view the table is to sum the value of the two genders in each age bracket, thus obtaining the combined labor value of a female-male pair of workers in each category; then we can compare the contribution of each gender to this total amount. Except for the five to twenty category, in which childbearing (presumably beginning at puberty) might reduce the labor potential of females, the female percentage of that combined female-male amount is at or near 40 percent. Social scientists who study the relative contributions of women and men to household labor in various cultures have noted that a 2:3 female-to-male ratio, with women supplying 40 percent of the subsistence labor, correlates with the maximum prestige for women. Thus the table of valuations in
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_27.1-34">
    Leviticus 27
   </a>
   is hardly a reflection of female inferiority but rather provides evidence of a positive estimation of women.

   In several different places, Mishnah

   records the names of women who made vows of various kinds, mostly related to their children. In the current context, it mentions the mother of a girl by the name of Yirmatia (or Domitia in a manuscript version) who vowed her daughter’s weight, although it is unclear to what purpose (5:1). Elsewhere in the Mishnah, Helena—the queen of Adiabene, a convert to Judaism who is also mentioned by the 1st-century-

   Nonetheless, even though women appear prominently as autonomous oath takers in rabbinic aggadic literature, halachically a woman’s oaths were subject to a father’s or husband’s annulment, much as specified already in biblical law (

   <small>

   , the Rabbis developed the regulations outlined in

Other evidence of this propensity is found in the words of the 4th-century Christian leader John Chrysostom of Antioch and Constantinople, known for his anti-Jewish sermons, who chastised his audience for flocking to the synagogues to take oaths.

The Rabbis devoted much more attention to regulating individualized vows such as vowing someone’s weight, or even the weight of a particular body part (Mishnah
   <i>
    Arachin

   5:1–2). Interestingly, the Rabbis take note that the Torah differentiates between the weight of male

   <i>
    n’kevah
   </i>
   ), and they therefore insist that this refers to those who are “definitely male” and “definitely female.” This is one of the many contexts in Jewish law where the Rabbis introduce the concept of indeterminable sexual identity, namely the hermaphrodite

    HERE IS SOMETHING
   </small>
   profoundly unsettling about
   <i>
    B’chukotai.
   </i>
   It seems to posit a world that we know, empirically, does not exist. It claims that there is a direct correlation between our actions and the natural order of the universe.
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_26.3-46">
    Leviticus 26:3–5
   </a>
   promises unambiguously: “If you follow My laws and faithfully observe My commandments, I will grant you rains in their season…you shall eat your fill of bread….”
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_14.1-32">
    Verses 14–16
   </a>
   warn just as clearly: “But if you do not obey Me and do not observe all these commandments…I will wreak misery upon you….” The seeming system of reward and punishment that these biblical passages proclaim appears to contradict the troubling reality that we witness, in which good people suffer, and evil people often prosper.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Passages like these seem to provide justification for those who reject both faith and God. How often do we hear, in the face of personal trauma or tragedy, “I can no longer believe in God” or “I can’t believe in a God who would do this”? How are we to understand God’s threats and promises?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   According to the biblical scholar Nehama Leibowitz, our ancestors regarded blessings and curses, such as those in
   <i>
    B’chukotai,
   </i>
   as forms of prayer: these are the things that people hoped for, even willed to happen, in their longing for a world in which justice would visibly prevail. Perhaps this parashah is telling us, in its own theological language, that there is a moral order to the universe that is intrinsically connected to the natural order of the universe—and that the two orders are mutually dependent. In these teachings, it is as if God gives humankind every opportunity to discern that human action is intrinsic, and essential, to the proper functioning of the cosmos. Over and over again, the Torah enjoins us to act, to do, and to be because we “were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt” (
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_6.1-7.5">
    Deuteronomy 6:21
   </a>
   ), because we “know the feelings of the stranger” (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 23:9
   </a>
   ), and through these experiences have been given the opportunity to glimpse this truth. This is why we were chosen to bear witness to God’s revelation that “I, your God
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   , am holy” (
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
    Leviticus 19:2
   </a>
   ). We are created in God’s image and we, as God’s partners, were chosen for a sacred task. This is our heritage and our responsibility; this is what it means to complete the work of Creation. But what if we forget, neglect, or ignore our sacred task of following the commandments?

  <div class="tab-enin">
   The catalogue of threats and promises is a biblical way to explain how intimate the connection of the natural realm of the universe is to the moral realm. The two realms do not function independently of each other. There is a moral order to the universe as surely as there is a more easily observable natural order of “rains in their season.”
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   And it is in the moral realm where God cannot function alone. God never could—and so kept looking
   <a id="page_783">
   </a>
   for partners. What did we expect of a God who created the natural universe? That the moral dimension was an afterthought? Our sages believed it pre-existed. God did not neglect the moral realm. On the contrary, humankind did. God kept expecting humankind to behave morally and was constantly disappointed—with Adam, with Noah, with the generations after the Flood. Finally, God found Abraham, the person who engaged God as an equal on ethical ground: “Must not the Judge of all the earth do justly?” (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 18:25
   </a>
   ), and the process of Revelation began.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The essential unity of all aspects of God’s Creation appears as well in Lurianic Kabbalah’s formulation of the universe. Isaac Luria’s theory of
   <i>
    Sh’virat Hakeilim
   </i>
   (Shattering of the Vessels) seeks to explain the brokenness of our world, and to advance the means to restore it to its original unity. For Luria in the 16th century, it was the great cosmic shattering that had brought about our exile from God and from God’s Creation. Luria not only understood the primordial unity of God’s intention but also yearned for a return to it. In God’s promise of “rains in their season [and presence] in your midst,” Luria could see the opportunity for humankind to repair the world, to release the sparks, to play a role in the restoration of the universe through the performance of mitzvot.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In Judaism, the mystic does not seek to transcend or deny the material world. Rather, the mystic’s goal is the objective of this Torah portion: to restore the world, materially and spiritually, to a “single divine reality.” As Lawrence Fine describes that goal in his study of Luria,
   <i>
    Physician of the Soul, Healer of the Cosmos
   </i>
   (2003), it is the “dream that collective human effort can mend a broken world.” This is the vision of
   <i>
    B’chukotai.
   </i>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In these final verses of the book of Leviticus, God describes—in the most tactile, physical, understandable terms possible—the relationship between God’s Creation and humankind’s responsibility. It is simultaneously bribe and promise, exhortation and encouragement. At the foundation of it all is the essential understanding of Torah: the physical and ethical dimensions of God’s Creation are wholly dependent upon each other, and we ignore that relationship at our peril. There is no quid pro quo for individuals in the world—God’s scheme is far grander and more subtle than that. The issue is not one of personal reward and punishment. It is the unity of God, the unity of the prophetic vision as rendered in the Reform liturgy: “On that day, all the world shall be One and God’s name shall be One” (Zechariah 14:9). It is the ultimate fulfillment of Torah—as expressed in
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_26.3-46">
    Leviticus 26:46
   </a>
   : “These are the laws, rules, and
   <i>
    torot
   </i>
   that
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   established
   <i>
    beino uvein b’nei Yisrael
   </i>
   (in relationship with the Children of Israel).” This is the partnership that must one day bring about the fulfillment of our hopes, dreams, and strivings—the sparks released as heaven and earth, heart and mind and soul are united at last.

    “the walking path.” As a Reform Jew, walking in God’s laws is not for me. I’d rather dance them. Lately, I’ve become a passionate dancer. I tap dance for fun, but ballroom dance is my unbridled joy. And on the dance floor, I’ve learned quite a bit about God and mitzvot. Dancing is a whole new way of being in the world. While I live pretty rationally, I dance best when I’m least cerebral. I’m not too bad at learning Torah and Talmud, but learning dance steps uses a whole different sort of memory. It’s muscle memory, body memory—a kind of memory that goes deeper and far beyond the scope of my intellect. My greatest challenge in ballroom dance has been learning to follow. I am used to being in control and trust my own abilities more easily than I trust my partners. It took me a long time to understand that following is a real blessing; trusting someone else to lead when I can anticipate and know the steps to come has become an important part of my joy as I whirl around the dance floor. Is God the supreme dance partner who invites me to join the dance of life, and to follow a rhythm that engages my body and my spirit?
