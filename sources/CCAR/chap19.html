   is theoretically everywhere, the Israelites needed assurance of God’s constant accessibility and availability. They accomplished this—as did the other peoples of the ancient Near East—by constructing an earthly residence for God, one that would mirror the heavenly prototype in which God was presumed to dwell. With God in their midst in an earthly shrine, God’s power to protect the people and provide for their well-being would be guaranteed. Beginning with
   <i>
    parashat T’rumah
   </i>
   (“gifts”), virtually all of the rest of Exodus focuses on the portable shrine known variously as the Tabernacle (
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   ) or Tent of Meeting (
   <i>
    Ohel Mo’ed
   </i>
   ). Even though some of its structure and objects are reflected in today’s synagogue furnishings, the Tabernacle should not be compared to a synagogue. It was not a house of worship; and it was off limits to all but the upper echelons of the priesthood. Instead of being a place of communal worship, it was conceived of as an elaborate and costly residence for the divine presence. The word
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   comes from the root meaning “to dwell” (
   <i>
    sh-k-n
   </i>
   ), which gave rise also to the well-known term
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   (see at
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
    25:8
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The wealth of seemingly exact details in the instructions for the Tabernacle belies the fact that such a structure probably never existed. The early Israelites may have had a relatively simple tent shrine—perhaps the Tent of Meeting—that was later incorporated into the Jerusalem Temple during the monarchy. Memories of the original shrine likely were expanded as the Exodus Tabernacle account took shape centuries later, influenced by knowledge of the First and Second Temples. This is a highly constructed account, and very little of it seems to be historical.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Tabernacle texts in Exodus—much like the sacred building texts of other ancient peoples—begin with elaborate instructions for making the
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   , its furnishings, and the priestly vestments (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#e25">
    Exodus 25–31
   </a>
   ); some Bible scholars call these instructions the
   <i>
    prescriptive
   </i>
   Tabernacle texts. Much of this information is repeated in another lengthy section relating how the instructions were implemented (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_33.1-36.7">
    Exodus 35–40
   </a>
   ); its passages are called the
   <i>
    descriptive
   </i>
   Tabernacle texts. The Golden Calf cepisode (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
    Exodus 32–34
   </a>
   ) separates these two pieces. It is helpful to remember that behind the mass of arcane details lies a yearning for God’s presence and an attempt to establish a relationship between divine immanence and transcendence, in other words, between God’s abilities to be “right here” and “everywhere” at the same time.

   Aside from God and Moses, the only other actors in this parashah are the “people” who collectively provide the building materials. While women are not explicitly mentioned in this Torah portion,
   <i>
    parashat Vayak’heil
   </i>
   specifies that both women and men donated their possessions for the construction of the
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-22">
    35:22
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-22">
    29
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e36-6">
    36:6
   </a>
   ) and that women were involved in producing textiles (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-22">
    35:25–26
   </a>
   ) and performing tasks at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e38-8">
    38:8
   </a>
   ). Such passages challenge the popular impression that this holy edifice is the result of exclusively male efforts.

   ecause the Tabernacle is conceived of as God’s abode, many of its features are highly symbolic. This is apparent in this introductory unit, which features seven categories of materials: metals, yarn, skins, wood, oil, spices, and gemstones. The number seven represents completeness in the Semitic world, so this group of materials signifies the totality of the supplies.

   Three metals will be used for the components of the Tabernacle according to their proximity to the most sacred space, the Holy of Holies. The most sacred objects will be made of gold, the most valuable metal.

   </i>
   The three colors specified for the woolen yarns—indigo blue, sea-snail purple, and cochineal red—were the most desirable and expensive in ancient Israel and the wider Near East. These particular dyes were self-fixing, meaning that they were relatively impervious to light and remained bright. Dying woolen strands with these colors was costly because the raw materials were difficult to use or rare. These three colors are probably listed in order of costliness. Textile production was largely the domain of women, as the Torah reflects in

   The verb comes from the root
   <i>
    sh-k-n.
   </i>
   The usual word for “dwell” (
   <i>
    y-sh-b
   </i>
   ) means to inhabit or live someplace. In contrast, the root
   <i>
    sh-k-n
   </i>
   indicates a moving, dynamic presence, not one tied to a fixed location. (The later concept of the
   <i>
    Shechinah

   comes from the same root; see
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#page_468">

   Or, “in the midst of” the people. Such language helps negotiate the tension between the freedom of God to be everywhere and the need of humans to have tangible evidence of God’s immanence and accessibility.

    tavnit,
   </i>
   a noun formed from the verb “to build” (
   <i>
    b-n-h

   Heb.
   <i>
    mishkan,
   </i>
   from the root
   <i>
    sh-k-n
   </i>
   (see at v. 8 under “dwell”), which allows for the mobility inherent in the concept of a tent-shrine. The noun conveys the idea of a dwelling-place and is not simply a synonym for tent. The English word “Tabernacle” (which derives from Latin) refers only to this wilderness shrine, whereas
   <i>
    mishkan
   </i>
   is a more general term: when it refers to a structure occupied by human beings it is translated as “dwelling, abode, home” (for example,
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_26.11">
    Leviticus 26:11

   ;

   </a>
   ,
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num24-5">

   he prescriptive texts (those detailing what is to be done) begin with the contents of the Tabernacle, in contrast with the descriptive texts (those detailing what was done), which begin with its structure (see the

    <i>

    </i>

   ARK AND ITS COVER (25:10–22)

  <div class="tab-enin">
   The term
   <i>
    aron
   </i>
   (“Ark”) denotes a box or chest used as a container for valuables, probably similar to those known from ancient Egypt. The Ark is to contain a document understood to be the Decalogue (“Ten Commandments”) or some form of the covenant between God and the people. At the same time, the Ark symbolically suggests a throne for the invisible deity and signifies God’s presence in the Tabernacle’s inner sanctum. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_37.1-29">

   </i>
   The Ark is to be nearly 4 feet long (a little more than 1 meter) and a bit more than 2 feet wide and deep (about ⅔ meter). The cubit was a widely used measure in the ancient Near East but was never standardized.

   These fanciful beasts are well known in ancient Near Eastern culture. Composite creatures made up of human and animal features, they are not at all like the round-faced cherubs of Western art.

   </i>
   The placement of the cherubim on either side of the “cover” forms a throne, with the cover as a footstool for God’s unseen presence (see at v. 17). The Ark, with its cover surmounted by cherubim, serves as the visible locus of God’s invisible royal presence.

   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_27.20-21">

   and frequently thereafter), is related to this concept of God’s interaction with the people at the place where the divine Presence rest. In ancient Israel, such meetings probably took the form of divine oracles delivered via qualified priests (see

    T’tzaveh
   </i>
   ,
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#page_489">

   ), or via prophetic figures like Moses (see
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-34">

   ). While women did serve as prophets in Israel (see at
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    15:20
   </a>
   ), Israelite priests were male. In the Torah’s depiction of the Tabernacle, oracular meetings held there to mediate God’s will to the people are restricted to select male agents: only those from the family of Levi.

   . In the ancient world, people typically sought oracles when they turned to a deity to resolve an otherwise intractable legal dispute (see, for example,
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    Numbers 27:1–5
   </a>
   ). Oracles also aided with political decisions, such as determining whether or when to go to war or levy taxes. According to the Torah, oracular decisions are achieved by mechanical means; see comments about the ephod (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-6">
    Exodus 28:6
   </a>
   ), priestly “breast-piece of decision” (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e28-15">

   TABLE AND MENORAH (25:23–40)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Tabernacle’s main, outer room is furnished with a table and a lampstand. A third object—an incense altar—will be mentioned in an addendum, in the next parashah (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_30.1-10">
    30:1–10
   </a>
   ). All three golden items are suitable furnishings for a royal abode; together they provide food and drink, light, and aromatic smells. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see

    37:10–24

   .)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The lampstand’s significance seems to lie less in its functional role as the bearer of a light source and more in its iconic significance, for it resembles sacred trees of other Near Eastern culture. Such trees conveyed the idea of the fertility granted by divine powers (see also at
   <a href="#exo_25.10-40">
    v. 31
   </a>
   ). Because those powers were associated with both male and female deities, the menorah’s presence in the Tabernacle perhaps conveyed the metaphoric female as well as male aspects of God.

      bread.

    </b>
   </i>
   When the Israelites lived in the Land of Israel, roughly half of their caloric intake came from cereal products. Bread was the most important part of their diet, and so not surprisingly bread has primacy in the retrojected Tabernacle offerings. But the text does not tell us who baked the bread. As in most traditional societies, bread production in Israelite households was almost exclusively the task of women (see also at
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-1">
    16:3
   </a>
   ). However, in pre-modern cultures, male specialists were often responsible for baking and cooking in elite contexts (like palaces or temples)—just as master chefs today are predominantly male even though home cooks typically are female. Yet because I Samuel 8:13 indicates that royal bakers and cooks were women, it is possible that the text envisions women as preparing this sacred bread for the tent shrine, although in a Second Temple text, this task is assigned to a levitical clan (I Chronicles 9:31).
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#l24-5">
    Leviticus 24:5–8
   </a>
   describes how the bread offering is to be prepared and presented (see also at

   Literally, “face.” This term characterizes the bread offering. Because “face” indicates divine presence (see at
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e33-20">
    33:20
   </a>
   ), its association with the bread offering perhaps signifies that the bread is for God. (However, it is eventually eaten by priests; see

   </i>
   The golden menorah has survived into post-biblical Judaism as one of the most recognizable Jewish symbols. The depiction of a single golden lampstand here conflicts with the description of ten lampstands in the First Temple (I Kings 7:49). It agrees, however, with the single lampstand of the Second Temple, which was carried off by the conquerors of Jerusalem and is depicted on the Arch of Titus in Rome. The lampstand of the Second Temple may recapture the single-menorah tradition of the pre-monarchic tent shrine. The terminology in the lampstand passage is replete with botanical terms, and its branched shape also implies a tree-like form. These features may signify the fertility provided by God or the idea of the eventual rise of a Davidic ruler as a “shoot” or “branch” (see Isaiah 11:1, Jeremiah 23:5, and Zechariah 3:8). The form may even allude to the female aspect of God’s presence, for female deities in the ancient Near East—such as the Canaanite goddess Asherah—may have been represented by sacred trees.

   These were apparently not to be attached to the lampstand, nor is it specified that they were to be made of gold. According to
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_27.20-21">
    Exodus 27:21
   </a>
   (see comment there), only one lamp may be involved. That is, the text may be describing a saucer lamp with seven spouts surmounting the central shaft, perhaps a simpler version of the complex visionary menorah of Zechariah 4:2.

   ith the directions for the Tabernacle’s interior furnishings complete, the narrative turns to the dwelling itself, which consists of two internal sections. The structure will have three components: coverings of textiles and animal skins, wooden frames, and two textile partitions. Despite the plethora of details, the specifications are incomplete and the directions for assembling the structure are unclear. Thus, it is unlikely that this section contains actual directions for making a real shrine. Information about flooring is lacking; perhaps a dirt floor is assumed (see
   <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#vfn16-1">
    Numbers 5:17

   COVERINGS (26:1–14)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The tent-like dwelling is to be made of two layers of fabric—decorated linen panels and unadorned goat-hair panels—which in turn will be covered with two layers of animal skins. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_36.8-38">

   </i>
   The translation does not capitalize this word in this passage (vv. 1–14), to indicate that the Hebrew noun
   <i>
    mishkan
   </i>
   denotes only the inner fabric component of the dwelling, to be made of decorated linen. (Compare at

   “Twisted” linen refers to the technique of spinning for preparing the linen thread. Women typically do this kind of work; compare

   Images of these fanciful composite creatures would not only form the “throne” over the Ark (see at

   The structure’s frame is to be constructed of a complex system of gilded boards and bars with metal fastenings; the frame is to be set into bases. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see

   The Hebrew word translated here as “planks” is used in the Bible only with regard to the Tabernacle; its precise nuance is not clear. Apparently the four layers of textiles and skins that comprise the tent will be hung on a frame made of acacia wood.

   The “planks” measure about 15 feet (4½ meters) by a bit more than 2 feet (about ⅔ meter); their thickness is not specified. Despite the minutiae provided, it is not clear how the frame would be assembled.

   The textile and skin coverings are to hang over a gilded wooden structure. The space thus created is to be divided into two parts by a textile partition hung on gilded posts. One of the areas is designated
   <i>

   </i>
   (“Holy”) and the other
   <i>
    kodesh kodashim
   </i>
   (“Holy of Holies”). Another textile partition, also hung on gilded posts, is to separate the interior space from the surrounding courtyard. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see

   The hooks and posts holding the screen are to be of gilded wood. The bases (“sockets”) in which they are to be set, however, are “copper” (probably bronze; see at
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">

    Instructions about the Courtyard

  <div class="tab-en">

   ike virtually every domicile in the ancient Near East, whether a village house or an urban palace, the Tabernacle is to have an unroofed outdoor space, a courtyard. Certain household functions, including roasting large pieces of meat, were performed more efficiently outdoors. Thus the altar for various types of offerings is to be placed in the courtyard.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Whereas the other parts of the Tabernacle were restricted to certain priests, the courtyard was a place where the rest of the people—including women—could enter and present their offerings.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="exo_vv.1-8">
   ALTAR (27:1–8)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Only the altar is mentioned in this section; but another courtyard installation, the laver (or basin), appears in
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e30-17">
    30:17–21
   </a>
   . The instructions say nothing about how the altar is to be used, though the following parashah mentions grain, oil, wine, and animals as offerings to be made on the altar (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e29-38">
    29:38–42
   </a>
   ). Leviticus and other biblical texts presume that women, like men, would approach the altar to present their offerings (see the
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#page_569">
    introduction to
    <i>
     Vayikra
    </i>
   </a>
   ). (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_38.1-20">
    38:1–8
   </a>
   .)

   </i>
   Because it is highly unlikely that a wooden altar, even one overlaid with metal, could have been functional, this must be a hypothetical item (see the
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#page_451">
    parashah introduction
   </a>
   ). A large-scale altar would have been made of stone, which would make it virtually impossible to build, dismantle, and transport. Features of known altars are integrated into the instructions for this somewhat imaginary wooden courtyard altar.

   </i>
   At about 7½ feet (more than 2 meters) square and 4½ feet (almost 1½ meters) high, the height would have required steps, thus making the altar conceptually different from stone or earthen altars (see
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-23">
    20:21–23
   </a>
   ), which can be built anywhere.

      horns on the four corners.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The most striking feature of the courtyard altar is that horns are to protrude from its four corners. How they are to be placed is not clear, but the positioning of the horns on stone altars discovered by archeologists suggests that the horns would have turned upward from the altar’s corners. Most of the excavated horned altars are quite small, like the incense altar of
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_30.1-10">
    30:1–10
   </a>
   ; but two massive ones have been found at Beersheba and Arad. In the Tabernacle, the altar and its horns are to play a role in the consecration ceremony (see
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e29-12">
    29:12
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">

     <a href="#chap-fn2a-4" id="chap-fn02a-4">
      copper.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Since the courtyard is the least holy zone, its furnishings, utensils, and carrying poles are to be made of bronze (see at
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#e25">
    25:3
   </a>
   ).

  <div class="tab-enin">

     <a href="#chap-fn3-4" id="chap-fn03-4">
      pails for removing its ashes.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   This anticipates the function of the altar, for the ashy remains of the wood fuel and of the offerings consumed by fire would need to be removed.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    <b>
     <a href="#chap-fn3a-4" id="chap-fn03a-4">

   These are probably for cleaning the altar after the sacrifice has been burnt.

  <div class="tab-enin">

     <a href="#chap-fn3b-4" id="chap-fn03b-4">
      basins.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The word for “basin” is from the verb
   <i>
    z-r-k
   </i>
   (“to sprinkle”), indicating that the basins are to be used to carry the blood to be sprinkled (“dashed”) on the altar (see, for instance,
   <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_7.6">
    Leviticus 7:2
   </a>
   ) or smeared on its horns (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#e29-12">

   ).

  <div class="tab-enin">

   These were used for carrying hot coals. The first step in preparing and using the altar comes last in the instructions, for the pails used for cleanup are specified first.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">

   It is not clear whether the bronze “grating of meshwork” and the “ledge” are meant to be decorative or functional elements of the altar, or both.

   This is another vague feature of the altar. Perhaps it is an attempt to deal with the conceptual problem of how an enormous object could be carried, or it may be related to the fact that no upper surface or top for the altar is specified.

   ENCLOSURE (27:9–19)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In the Land of Israel at the time of the Bible, people typically surrounded the courtyards of homes and palaces with enclosure walls that marked the limits of the premises. The enclosure also controlled the movement of animals and small children and protected the domestic and productive space and its contents from intruders. As the text describes the sacred Tabernacle precinct, its courtyard enclosure also serves as the boundary between holy space within and profane space outside. Despite the many details, directions for positioning the Tabernacle within the enclosure are not provided. (For the descriptive text later in Exodus that parallels this prescriptive section, see
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e38-9">
    38:9–20
   </a>

   </i>
   Undecorated linen fabrics form the courtyard walls. They are to be made of the highest quality linen; but unlike the linen used for the interior fabrics (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_26.1-37">
    26:1
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#e26-31">

   </i>
   The entrance to the courtyard is to be spanned by a textile panel of a more elaborate fabric, apparently the same as the screen for the entrance to the interior space (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#e26-36">
    26:36

   Like the tent within, the courtyard is to be rectangular, about 50 yards (46 meters) by 25 yards (23 meters), with fabric walls more than 7 feet (more than 2 meters) high.

   specifications for constructing the Tabernacle and its furnishings. Although the gender of the artisans is not mentioned, other biblical passages indicate that metallurgy was a male domain (I Samuel 8:12), while spinning and weaving were women’s work (Judges 16:13–14; II Samuel 3:29; Proverbs 31:19). Producing and dyeing yarns, weaving, and embroidering textiles for the Tent of Meeting and officiating priests’ clothing thus provided an avenue for women of the Exodus account to participate in this public and communal religious practice. According to II Kings 23:7, women continued producing textiles as devotional service also during the time of the Jerusalem Temple: while working in a room within the Temple precinct, “the women wove coverings” for the wooden pole of Asherah that stood in the Temple. (On worship of the goddess Asherah, see at
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
    Exodus 34:13
   </a>
   .)

  <div class="tab-enin">
   Archeological evidence of weaving abounds in both domestic and industrial contexts in the biblical period. Ceramic loom weights, indicative of an upright warpweighted loom, stone or ceramic spindle whorls for twisting fibers into continuous yarn, and bone shuttles for weaving are common finds in domestic contexts. Loom weights found in rows suggest that looms, consisting of a crossbeam supported by two upright beams, rested against a room or courtyard wall. The weights pulled taut the vertical warp strings tied to the crossbeam above. Most women spun and wove to satisfy household needs: clothing, cloaks that also served as blankets, bags to transport grain, and waterproof coverings of goats’ hair. Sheep and goats from one’s flocks, the two most common domesticated animals, provided wool and hair; linen was produced from flax fibers.

   While Israelite women wove cloth at home, the highly prized dye denoting sovereignty that was mandated for the Tabernacle curtains and vestments—
   <i>

   <i>
    argaman
   </i>
   (purple)—was manufactured in specialized installations at coastal sites. A Mediterranean mollusk,

   (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">

   ). The two key Hebrew words,
   <i>
    v’shachanti
   </i>
   (“that I may dwell”) and
   <i>
    mishkan
   </i>
   (“Tabernacle”), are related linguistically to the feminine noun
   <i>
    Shechinah.
   </i>
   The Rabbis used that term for the indwelling and intimately felt presence of God, believing that the
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   was present in the Tabernacle and, later, in the Temple in Jerusalem. According to the Talmud, the
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   also accompanied Israel into exile (BT
   <i>
    M'gillah
   </i>
   29a) and becomes manifest during communal worship (BT
   <i>
    Sanhedrin
   </i>
   39a) and moments of individual need (BT
   <i>
    Shabbat
   </i>
   12b). [As Sharon Faye Koren explains (“Shekhinah as Female Symbol,”
   <i>
    Encyclopaedia Judaica,
   </i>
   2nd ed., 2006), medieval Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah) often represented the
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   as a female aspect of God. The
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   mediated between heaven and earth and served as the passive eye or door through which a mystic could achieve divine vision. The mystics believed that sexual relations between the
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   and a male aspect of the divine brought about cosmic harmony. (Similarly, intercourse between a male mystic and his wife on earth, especially on Shabbat night, could foster both divine and mystical union.) Some contemporary Jewish feminists have reclaimed the symbol of the
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   to counter what they perceive to be the patriarchal bias of Jewish theology; they have reinterpreted mystical themes and emphasize the symbol of the feminine
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   in innovative new liturgies. —

   (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
    25:9
   </a>
   ). God’s instructions concerning the building of the Tabernacle are recounted in the Torah prior to the incident of the Golden Calf (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
    Exodus 32–34
   </a>
   ). However, some rabbinic commentators believed that these directions were given after that shameful event; and they interpret God’s command to create the Tabernacle as a sign of divine forgiveness. According to Midrash
   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah
   </i>
   51.4, the nations of the world had declared that God would never be reconciled with Israel after Israel rejected God in favor of an idol. However, Moses sucessfully pleaded for mercy on the people’s behalf. At that moment, God said to Moses, “I will let my
   <i>
    Shechinah
   </i>
   dwell among [the Israelites], so that all may know that I have forgiven Israel. My sanctuary in their midst will be testimony of My forgiveness—and from this time on may be called a ‘Tabernacle of Testimony.’” (On the
   <i>
    Shechinah,
   </i>
   see the previous comment.) Nachmanides, however, did not accept this tampering with chronology. He suggested that the commandment to build the Tabernacle was divine acknowledgment of Israel’s merit in having freely accepted the Decalogue (comment to
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#exo_33.1-36.7">
    35:1

   1.1–2 understands the Tabernacle as a sign of God’s love for Israel and portrays it as a bridal chamber for the bride (Israel) and groom (God), patterned on the heavenly Tabernacle. A parable in
   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah
   </i>
   33.1 utilizes somewhat different symbolism: When the beloved daughter of a king married another king, her father could not bear to part from her and so requested that his son-in-law build him a room so he could dwell with her. Here, God is depicted as a father and the Tabernacle as a place for the father to remain with his beloved daughter, Israel.

   <i>

   contraction, God could meet with Moses from between the cherubim, which were ten spans above the earth

   <i>
    Zohar
   </i>
   elaborates: “The mystery of the Tabernacle which is [composed of] limbs and joints—they all amount to the mystery of the human being, on the pattern of the commandments in the Torah, for all the commandments in the Torah are in the form of the mystery of the human being, male and female, for when they are joined together they are the single mystery of humanity” (

   35.1 asks why the Hebrew reads “

   on building the symbolic core of the Israelites: the Tabernacle (
   <i>
    Mishkan),
   </i>
   which will become the central shrine and sacred symbol of God’s dwelling amidst the people. The
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   will be a physical entity, but it will spiritually link the Israelites into a nation through God’s divine Presence. This portable structure is considered the forerunner of the Temple built in Jerusalem many generations after the wilderness experience. Today, the synagogue, with its distinct reminders of the Tabernacle and Temple, functions as the communal focal point for the Jewish people. It, too, serves as the spiritual center connecting Jews of all generations to our history, people, and covenant.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The building of the
   <i>
    Mishkan
   </i>
   will force the Israelites to work together in order to fulfill a common goal and prepare for a common future. Although they have just been given the Decalogue—the precepts that bind the Israelites to God and one another—the people’s participation in the making of the Tabernacle will unify the nation in a different way. It will elevate the seemingly mundane work of construction into a sacred vocation, dedicated to the service of the One God who freed them from Egypt and revealed the terms of the covenant.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   These former slaves are no strangers to building monuments and cities. The backbreaking labor of the Israelites in Egypt glorified the pharaoh and the Egyptian gods; but this certainly was not a sacred endeavor. In contrast, constructing the Tabernacle and all its finery will be holy work that aims to create sacred space and sacred instruments of worship.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    Parashat T’rumah
   </i>
   goes into great detail about the various parts of the Tabernacle, describing the Ark of the Covenant, the special table for the bread of display, the menorah, the curtains of the tent, the
   <i>
    parochet
   </i>
   (partition that screens off the sacred inner sanctum),
   <a id="page_470">
   </a>
   and the altar for delivering offerings to God. In this Torah portion and the ones that follow, the design of the Tabernacle and its contents are laid out with precise measurements and great specificity. A number of these objects can be found in contemporary synagogues, reminders of the sacred structures of our biblical ancestors. Then and now, the ark stands as the epicenter of God’s presence and the container for the divine word. Many arks contain a special curtain or partition called a
   <i>
    parochet,
   </i>
   as in the Tabernacle. In sanctuaries today, the menorah shines as a symbol of the Jewish people, just as the
   <i>
    ner tamid
   </i>
   (
   <a href="23_chapter_20.xhtml#exo_27.20-21">
    27:20
   </a>
   ; understood as an eternal light) provides a sign of God’s indwelling presence.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   According to
   <i>
    parashat T’rumah,
   </i>
   the Israelites— women and men alike—provide not only the labor, but also the raw materials for the
   <i>
    Mishkan.
   </i>
   Their gifts, brought as voluntary offerings, are gathered and transformed into a place for God to reside in their midst. Imagine how these former slaves felt as they became both builders of a nation and builders of a dwelling place for the Divine!
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   God instructs Moses: “Tell the Israelite people to bring Me gifts; you shall accept gifts for Me from every person whose heart is so moved” (
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
    25:2
   </a>
   ). This kind of giving, a freewill offering, does not come through guilt, coercion, or competition, but from the deepest recesses of the soul. The Israelites bring yarns, precious metals, cloth, and tanned skins—an array of earthly objects that will eventually become the sacred space where Israel can seek God’s presence.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Today, it is important for all of us to continue to make freewill offerings to the institutions that unify the Jewish people. Along with
   <i>
    tzedakah
   </i>
   (required giving),
   <i>
    t’rumah
   </i>
   (voluntary giving) is vital for sustaining our community. Synagogues, Jewish centers, and Jewish communal agencies cannot survive on membership fees or dues alone. As they struggle to meet their financial needs, these institutions require our heartfelt support through the freewill gifts that are necessary to fulfill the good and holy work of these organizations.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The synagogue, in particular, lies at the intersection of the earthly and heavenly realms. The heir to the
   <i>
    Ohel Mo’ed
   </i>
   (Tent of Meeting), the contemporary synagogue is the place where Jews most often seek out God. Through study, prayer, and communal gatherings, the synagogue provides the necessary environment for Jewish connection, renewal, and survival. When we bring our voluntary gifts of money, time, and other resources, we bring the realm of the holy into our lives.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Just as our ancestors were transformed from ordinary slaves into builders of God’s home on earth, we too are transformed through this sacred endeavor. We bring more peace, more hope, and more faith into our own lives and the life of our community when we support and build the synagogue. We strengthen the Jewish people even as we strengthen ourselves as Jews.

   Voluntary giving is different for each and every person; it is not simply a percentage or flat rate. A person of substantial means has the ability to give greater sums, while a person of more modest means might not have the capacity to give at such large levels. Nevertheless, each person can and should give significantly. The definition of a “meaningful gift” varies for each individual, depending on one’s circumstances. But regardless of the
   <i>
    quantity
   </i>
   of the offering, the
   <i>
    quality
   </i>
   is the same: giving a meaningful voluntary offering to a synagogue or other Jewish institution is a privilege, not a burden. This kind of giving—be it of money or time and effort—is cheerful giving, giving that makes a difference, giving that matters. Our parashah teaches that the
   <i>
    t’rumah-
   </i>
   gift is an offering that comes from the deep recesses of the heart. Then and now, it is a privilege to be involved in the sacred work of building community and constructing a dwelling place for the Divine.

    : Shekhinah, the Holy-One-Who-Dwells-in-This World, represents the mystical Community of Israel. All Israel constitutes her limbs. She is our intimate link with God-Who-Dwells-on-High and our companion as we wander in exile. As it is written:
    <i>
     “and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them
    </i>
    (
    <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.1-9">
     Exodus 25:8
    </a>
    ). Not ‘I will dwell below,’ but
    <i>
     among
    </i>
    you—just as a wanderer would. In other words, wherever Israel wanders, I will go with them and I will dwell among them, but not in a permanent place.” Mercifully, She holds back God’s upraised hand when it threatens to harm Her children, but She does not hesitate to punish us Herself when we stray.

    There is a strange little melody inside me that sometimes cries out for words. But through inhibition, lack of self-confidence, laziness and goodness knows what else, that tune remains stifled, haunting me from within. Sometimes it wears me out completely. And then again it fills me with gentle, melancholy music. Sometimes I want to flee with everything I possess into a few words, seek refuge in them. But there are still no words to shelter me. That is the real problem. I am in search of a haven, yet I must first build it for myself, stone by stone. Everyone seeks a home, a refuge. And I am always in search of a few words.
