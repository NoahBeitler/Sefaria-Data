   (“magistrates”) continues Moses’ speech in which he delineates various legal teachings for Israel. This portion focuses on the organization of the community and the promulgation of rules to promote justice within it. Although the logic behind the order of laws in the Bible is not always apparent, in this parashah we can see the relationship between many of the sections. These laws tend to be of a practical nature—for the Bible rarely theorizes or philosophizes. Yet taken together, they draw a picture of the type of ideal society that Deuteronomy envisions. In such a community, justice functions as the operative principle; and all individuals, even the king, come under its rules. Every member of society is entitled to the same justice, in both religious and civil matters. (These two areas of life were not distinguished in ancient times as they are today.) While mainly concerned with the internal workings of the community, justice also applies to the conduct of war. Along with the idea that people deserve a fair government, Deuteronomy expresses the even more important idea that the failure to perform justice constitutes a failure to heed God’s commandments, which endangers the future of Israel.

   Deuteronomy does not, for the most part, envision women serving as public officials and certainly not as priests or soldiers. However, women figure in a number of laws, especially in the following parashah (
   <i>
    Ki Teitzei
   </i>
   ). Most of the laws are phrased in the grammatical masculine (the linguistically unmarked term that often includes both genders); but in some cases, to emphasize that the legislation concerns women and men, the text explicitly addresses both genders. For example,
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#d17-2">
    17:2–5
   </a>
   stipulates that “the man or the woman” who engages in idolatrous worship will be put to death. Although the laws in Deuteronomy do not consider women to be the responsible party in their own right in all matters, they are protected when they might be victims and prosecuted when they are guilty of crimes.

   or Deuteronomy, the so-called “civil” and “religious” authorities all fall under the constraints of the justice system. According to Bernard Levinson, this unit provides what appears to be “the first blueprint for a constitutional government” in which “no single branch of government and no single religious institution should have sole power” (“Deuteronomy,”
   <i>
    Jewish Study Bible,
   </i>
   2004, p. 403).

   THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM (16:18–17:13)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This section commands the community (not God) to appoint lay people (not priests or prophets) to serve as professional judges and judicial administrators. Such individuals appear to be selected from among the existing chiefs, military officers, or other types of officials (see
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#d1-9">
    1:15
   </a>
   ). They are charged with the vital task of executing justice impartially. According to Nili Fox, in the monarchic period the king probably appointed these government officials, who often worked in conjunction with the elders in administering justice
   <i>
    (In the Service of the King,
   </i>
   2000, pp. 165, 172). The text does not mention any qualifications or training for these “magistrates and officials,” nor is their gender specified, for the language is couched in the default grammatical masculine. One may assume that in most cases they would be men, but the possibility of a woman serving as a judge (like Deborah) should not be excluded (see Judges 4–5).

   Although Deuteronomy centralizes sacrifice (see at
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu12-2">
    12:2–14
   </a>
   ), it makes no attempt to centralize the court system; people must be able to obtain justice locally. The Hebrew term translated here as “settlements” is literally “gates,” the area at the entrance to a walled settlement where people would come together to conduct their commercial and legal affairs. For example, in Ruth 4:1, Boaz and the unnamed redeemer engage in the transfer of real estate and marriage rights at the gate, in the presence of ten representative elders. In Proverbs 31 (the “Woman of Valor” passage), the husband’s position “in the gates” shows him to be a prominent citizen (v. 23); and the woman’s works are publicly recognized “in the gates” (v. 31).

   This passage applies to apostates the procedure for capital punishment. The case involves “a man or woman” (a phrase repeated three times in

    vv. 2
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu16-5">

   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#D13-15">
    13:13–17
   </a>
   ). Notice that the text here considers women autonomous persons, responsible for their own actions (not under the control of fathers or husbands) and therefore potentially guilty of a capital offense. In contrast, the passage on prophets (
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#d18-15">
    18:15–22
   </a>
   ) is phrased solely in the masculine, although women prophets existed in the Bible and ancient Near East. (See

   The principle of a minimum of two witnesses is articulated again in

   and
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#n35-30">

   </a>
   . The Bible does not specify whether women could serve as witnesses. [In the Dead Sea Scrolls (2nd century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   ), women are encouraged to testify as a witness against their husband in certain matters (see Tal Ilan, “Women,”
   <i>
    Encyclopaedia Judaica,
   </i>
   2nd edn., 2007, 21:164). This evidence suggests that women were able to serve as witnesses at certain early periods, perhaps also in the time of the Bible. —
   <i>
    Ed.
   </i>
   ] A witness has a crucial role to play in the verdict, so giving false testimony constitutes a serious crime (
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#deu19-15">
    19:15–21
   </a>
   ). In the story of Susanna (in the Apocrypha), two corrupt elders falsely accuse Susanna, a young and virtuous wife, of having an encounter with a young man other than her husband. They do so in an attempt to get even with Susanna for refusing their own advances; but when the wise Daniel interrogates the witnesses separately to see if their reports agree, he discovers the ruse.

   While public executions are not tasteful to many in contemporary Western societies, the participation of the entire community shows that everyone has a stake in “sweeping out evil” from the community. This practice does not delegate the “dirty work” to professional executioners, but instead holds all the people—or at least a body of their representatives—responsible for carrying out the sentence. (It remains unclear as to whether or not this includes women.)

   This passage establishes that the priest or lay magistrate at the central sanctuary adjudicates cases that cannot be solved at the local level, a system similar to that described in

    </b>
   </i>
   The baffling case involves a situation that lacks two witnesses or any other evidence upon which the local judges can ascertain the truth of the matter. When human beings cannot adjudicate, the case goes to the divine authority, so that God, through God’s representatives, can determine the verdict (see
   <a href="#deu19-15">
    19:17
   </a>
   ; I Kings 8:31–32); ancient Near Eastern law collections have similar procedures. Before the centralization of sacrifice (the hallmark of Deuteronomy), people would have brought such a case to the local sanctuary. Now, with the absence of local sanctuaries, divine judgment can be rendered only at the central sanctuary (Bernard Levinson, “Deuteronomy,”
   <i>
    Jewish Study Bible,
   </i>
   2004, pp. 404–05).

   Some interpreters think that the levitical priests rendered decisions on ritual matters, while the lay judges decided non-ritual cases. While this seems to be the view of II Chronicles 19:8,
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#d17-8">
    Deuteronomy 17:8

   The text emphasizes the need to adhere to the judgment rendered and to carry it out as prescribed. The fact that disregarding the verdict itself becomes a capital offense stresses the seriousness of the justice system and the safeguards Deuteronomy imposes to preserve it. At the same time, Deuteronomy limits the authority of human officials (see below).

  <div class="head2" id="deu_17.14-20">
   KINGS (17:14–20)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Bible considers a king to be subordinate to God and the legal system; hence, in a remarkable move, it puts limitations on royal power. Unlike in the Laws of Hammurabi and other ancient Near Eastern texts, the king does not promulgate law but instead is subject to it. In Deuteronomy, the king does not explicitly figure in the local or central courts. Elsewhere in the Bible, kings function as the overall guardians of justice. Yet they serve as judges in only a few cases, as when Solomon decides the case of the prostitutes’ two babies (I Kings 3:16–28) or when David deals with the “wise woman” of Tekoa, who presents a fabricated case calculated to make David bring his son Absalom back home (II Samuel 14). Perhaps even more surprising, he must continually read and obey the Teaching (
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   ). This section presents a picture here of a “constitutional monarchy” in which the king “will not act haughtily toward his fellows” (
   <a href="#deu17-20">
    v. 20
   </a>
   ).

   Although modern scholars date some parts of Deuteronomy to the time of Josiah (late 7th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   ) and other parts to the Babylonian exile (6th century
   <small>

    </b>
   </i>
   This statement, put into the mouths of the Israelites, anticipates the reason found in I Samuel 8:5 for requesting a king: because the other nations have kings. Such a request presumes that Israel must have this form of centralized government, rather than the decentralized tribal system, in order to be competitive with its neighbors, especially when it comes to military campaigns.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   This and the following verse use the portrait of Solomon to criticize the dangers of excessive royal power. According to I Kings 5:6 and 10:26, Solomon had 40,000 stalls of horses, 12,000 horsemen, 1,400 chariots, and 12,000 horses, which he imported from Egypt and Kue. These large numbers function as a way to show Solomon’s wealth and grandeur—precisely what Deuteronomy seeks to limit.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   This criticism also is built on the portrait of Solomon, who reportedly had a thousand wives (I Kings 11:1–5), many of them foreigners with whom he made political marriages. Such marriages were common in the ancient world for their diplomatic benefits, for they worked to assure peaceful relations between the royal families and thus their countries. The fact that Israelite kings had foreign wives of royal lineage shows they were players on the international scene. The Bible is concerned with the importation of foreign wives, because it believed these wives introduced their own forms of foreign worship into the royal court, thereby “leading the people astray” with idolatrous practices. Jezebel stands out as a prime example, for this Phoenician princess and wife of King Ahab worshipped Baal—and led her husband to do so as well (I Kings 16:31–33; 21:25–26).

   Levitical priests will write a copy of the Teaching for the king, who must read it regularly. The word for “Teaching,”
   <i>
    torah,
   </i>
   does not refer to the so-called Five Books of Moses, nor probably even to the book of Deuteronomy, but rather to this section pertaining to the king, or to other legal portions of Deuteronomy. This law aims to emphasize and remind the king constantly that he is subject to God’s law. In Hebrew, the term
   <i>
    mishneh torah
   </i>
   (“copy of this Teaching,” literally “a second
   <i>
    torah”)
   </i>
   becomes one of the names for Deuteronomy in rabbinic literature, since the book reviews large parts of the earlier books of the Torah (
   <i>
    Sifrei D’varim
   </i>
   160). The Greek translation of this term is “Deuteronomion,” hence the English name of the book.

   Unlike the laws concerning the king, this section expresses no interest in limiting the power of the levitical priests, but rather in ensuring that they, as a disadvantaged class, obtain their due. Their disadvantage lies in the fact that they have no land holdings, the main source of income for non-levitical Israelites in an agricultural society (see at 12:19). Levites therefore depend for their livelihood on a “tax” levied on sacrifices and tithes. The Israelites, to whom these instructions are addressed, must see to it that the levitical priests receive their proper income.

   Leviticus and Numbers typically distinguish between priests (
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   , a special subset of Levites defined as the descendants of Aaron) and Levites; only the
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   can officiate in the presentation of offerings to God and can eat certain portions of sacrificial foodstuffs (see
   <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#num_16.1-35">
    Numbers 16
   </a>
   and
   <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#num_18.1-32">
    18
   </a>
   ). Deuteronomy uses the anomalous term “levitical priests” (literally “the priests the Levites”), suggesting that it does not see two distinct classes but rather one group of potential priests. Deuteronomy gives all Levites the same right to eat portions from the sacrifices (a privilege limited to the priests in the other sources), and permits all of them to serve at the central sanctuary if they choose.

   The Hebrew has a singular suffix, “his (or its) portion”; the translation understands the antecedent to be the tribe of Levi (as in

    12:12

   Since Deuteronomy outlaws local sanctuaries, the Levites formerly serving at these sanctuaries can no longer earn a livelihood except at the central sanctuary. Those who do not serve there must depend on communal charity, along with the widow, the fatherless, and the stranger (see
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#d14-29">

   Like most of the laws in Deuteronomy, this one pertains to the settlement in the Promised Land. In this case, the danger concerns the negative religious influence of the Canaanites. Modern scholars note that by the time Deuteronomy was composed, the Canaanites were long gone. Thus, the Bible uses the term “Canaanite” anachronistically as a symbol for “the other,” often defining what is Israelite in opposition to what it calls Canaanite. Our passage uses “those nations” to refer to the various nations living in Canaan (Canaanites, Perizzites, and so forth). The practices listed as abhorrent are attested widely throughout the ancient Near East.

   The story of the medium of En-dor (I Samuel 28) and Isaiah 29:4 both confirm that communicating with the dead, or necromancy, was practiced in Israel. King Saul consults the medium of En-dor, a female necromancer, when all other forms of communication with the Divine have failed; and she successfully enables Saul to communicate with the dead prophet Samuel. Many Israelites, like other peoples of the time and later, showed an abiding concern for the dead, especially dead ancestors (see also at

   Having banned various divinatory practices, Deuteronomy now explains the legitimate way for Israel to access God’s will: through a prophet. The type of prophecy envisioned derives from the people’s desire for professional intermediaries to whom they could pose questions and receive information that would help them make decisions. In addition, as part of the narrative of the revelation at Sinai, the people request an intermediary in order to avoid the dangers inherent when one has direct contact with God (see
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#d5-19">
    5:19–24
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_20.15-23">

   Moses serves as the model for all later prophets, even though no prophet has as close contact with God as he did (see
   <a href="57_chapter_54.xhtml#deu34-10">
    Deuteronomy 34:10
   </a>
   ). The Hebrew speaks of the prophet in the masculine, as this is the linguistic default; but that does not exclude female prophets. The Bible refers to four female prophets by name: Miriam (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:20
   </a>
   ), Deborah (Judges 4:4), Huldah (II Kings 22:14–20), and Noadiah (Nehemiah 6:14); other passages mention unnamed female prophets (Isaiah 8:3; Ezekiel 13:17; Joel 3:1).

   This is Deuteronomy’s term for Sinai (see at

   The most crucial attribute of the true prophet is that he or she speaks in God’s name. Since the prophet serves as the vehicle through whom God communicates, the true prophet must be taken seriously and heeded. Clearly, a prophet speaking in the name of a foreign god is false, but what about a prophet who claims to be speaking in God’s name—how is the audience to know if the prophet truly speaks God’s words? This passage establishes the criterion of whether or not those words come to pass, which means that the audience must wait for the outcome of the prophecy. Jeremiah offers a slightly different test, suggesting that one need wait for the outcome only in prophecies of weal, whereas prophecies of doom should always be believed (Jeremiah 28:7–9).

   CITIES OF REFUGE (19:1–13)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This section mandates that the people should set aside three cities initially, with the addition of three more as needed, to provide refuge for persons guilty of unintentional homicide (see also
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_4.41-43">
    4:41–42;
   </a>
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#E21-13">

   </a>
   ;
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num35-6">
    Numbers 35:9–34
   </a>
   ). This law reflects an old practice that runs parallel to, and counter to, Deuteronomy’s principle that the courts have jurisdiction over the sentencing of a person to capital punishment and the carrying out of that punishment if warranted; in this case, a relative avenges a killing. A person who commits manslaughter could, according to other texts, find refuge at an altar (see I Kings 2:28–34); but since Deuteronomy bans local sanctuaries, it must find a substitute site of refuge, which it does by establishing “secular” cities of refuge (not the same as the levitical cities mentioned in
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#e35-40">
    Numbers 35
   </a>
   ). The principle inherent in this law fits with the Deuteronomic principles that innocent blood should not be spilled and that the guilty should receive just punishment.

   Could women avail themselves of a city of refuge? This translation understands the person who commits manslaughter as being male. While certainly women were capable of committing murder or manslaughter, it seems reasonable to assume that the person fleeing to a city of refuge would more often be a male. One reason for this conclusion is that since women did not normally live independently, it would be problematic for a woman who commits manslaughter to leave her family and live in a city of refuge.

   BOUNDARY MARKERS (19:14)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   An important biblical principle holds that land should remain in the family to which it was originally allotted. Hence, moving a boundary marker is considered stealing property. The reason for the mention of this law here remains uncertain. This ancient law is known also from elsewhere in the Bible (see Hosea 5:10; Proverbs 22:28; 23:10–11; Job 24:2) and the ancient Near East.

   This section reiterates the principle of a minimum of two witnesses (see
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#deu17-6">
    Deuteronomy 17:6
   </a>
   ). The Bible severely punishes false witnesses since they corrupt the legal system. The idea that a false witness deserves the punishment that would have been declared against the accused also appears in the Laws of Hammurabi (¶¶ 2–3).

   These deferments or exemptions are designed to permit a young conscript to complete the establishment of his home, agricultural livelihood, and family—the major anchors of society. The law is less concerned with the feelings of the individual soldier than with the formation of crucial social institutions. Establishing a house, farm, and family is the greater good, even in time of war; for without these there is no community (see also

   These procedures are typical of ancient Near Eastern warfare. If a city capitulated by accepting the peace terms, it was spared a siege, which generally resulted in starvation and disease before capitulation. Peace terms would specify the payment of tribute, which included forced labor by the captives. The killing of the adult males and the taking of women, children, and livestock as booty are also typical (as seen in the case of the foreign woman taken in warfare in
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_21.10-21">
    21:10–14
   </a>
   ) and have the effect of further weakening—or even decimating—the losing side as well as providing human capital for the victors. In I Samuel 30, David’s wives and the “wives and sons and daughters” of his six hundred men (30:3) are taken captive by a band of Amalekite raiders.

   This passage prohibits a “scorched earth” policy. Only trees that do not provide food may be cut down, if necessary, to be used for constructing ramps and scaffolding to scale the city walls. To the contemporary reader this may sound like an ecologically minded policy; but the reason for it is unclear. Perhaps it was meant to ensure a food supply for the soldiers.

   euteronomy exhibits a concern not only with punishing the guilty, but also with ensuring that the community bears no responsibility for bloodshed, for the shedding of innocent blood makes the land impure (see also

   ,
   <a href="#d19-13">

   A prayer that God will absolve the guilt follows the oath. Notice that it is no longer a matter of one town, but of “your people,” that is, Israel as a whole. Even in the somewhat “secularized” laws of Deuteronomy, justice in human affairs is part of Israel’s religious view.

    EUTERONOMY CONTAINS
   </small>
   the only ancient Near Eastern legal corpus that extensively treats the question of correct wartime behavior.
   <i>
    Parashat Shof’tim
   </i>
   introduces the first group of regulations (
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#deu_20.1-20">
    20:1–9
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#nn20-14a">
    10–18
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#d20-19">
    19–20
   </a>
   ); the rest are scattered throughout the next parashah (
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_21.10-21">
    21:10–14
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_23.10-24.9">
    23:10–15
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#chap-fn5-5a">
    24:5
   </a>
   ). Curiously, these regulations are not what one might expect from a collection of laws related to warfare. They are not concerned with strategic issues typical of warfare, like mustering the army, logistics, or battle tactics. Instead, the military regulations in our parashah deal with the peripheral aspects of war, particularly with those affected by it: women and children, cattle, trees, and even members of the attacking side.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The first, and therefore most prominent, rule defines those conscripts who are released from war (
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#chap-fn5-3">
    20:5–7
   </a>
   ): men who have built a new house, planted a vineyard, or given a betrothal gift, but they have not yet benefited from these three types of investments. The reason given is “lest he die in battle” and another person profit. This rationale echoes the curse familiar from ancient Near Eastern treaties: you will labor, but someone else will eat the fruit of your toil. It is noteworthy that in 28:30, precisely the three cases in our parashah are turned into curses. Thus, rather than glorify warfare, Deuteronomy views it as a curse that needs curbing, even for the attacking side.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Similar to the stipulations in our parashah pertaining to the establishment of a monarchy (
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#deu17-14">
    17:14–20
   </a>
   ), these rules of war reflect a subversive criticism of a key element prevalent in ancient societies: in this case, wars of expansion inaugurated by the Neo-Assyrian empire in the 8th to 7th centuries
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   Therefore, Deuteronomy’s rules of warfare can be understood as an ideological polemic related to the military and political pressures that Israel and Judah experienced at the time.

   We see, then, that the attitude toward warfare in our parashah is a learned reaction to wars forced upon the small nations at that time. Criticizing military acts implicitly and indirectly reveals the viewpoint of the Israelite underdogs, the victims of such actions.

   (
   <a href="#deu17-6">
    17:6
   </a>
   ). Despite the admirable exhortation in this parashah to pursue justice (
   <a href="#page_1144">
    16:20
   </a>
   ), post-biblical Judaism restricted women’s participation in the judicial system. In response to the requirement of two witnesses for criminal cases in this verse and
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#deu19-15">
    19:15–17
   </a>
   ,
   <i>
    Sifrei D’varim
   </i>
   190 asks, “Is a woman also qualified to give testimony?” Their answer is no, for they note that in
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#deu19-15">
    19:15
   </a>
   the Torah states “two witnesses” and further on, in
   <a href="#deu19-17">
    19:17
   </a>
   , “two [men].” Reading these two biblical verses literally, the Rabbis reason: “As the meaning of ‘two’ in the one instance is men and not women, so the meaning of ‘two’ in the other instance is men and not women.” Even earlier, the Jewish historian Josephus (1st century
   <small>
    C.E.
   </small>
   ) asserted
   <a id="page_1159">
   </a>
   that “by Jewish law women are disqualified as witnesses” (
   <i>
    Jewish Antiquities
   </i>
   4.219).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   However, the Mishnah (
   <i>
    Y’vamot
   </i>
   15:1–5 and 16:5) permits a woman to serve as a sole witness in establishing a man’s death, thus allowing his widow to remarry. Since rabbinic courts accepted female testimony in this and some other situations, why were they excluded from most civil and criminal cases? The Rabbis did not give a reason for their general disqualification of women as legal witnesses. Perhaps women’s dependence on their husbands or fathers was understood to compromise their ability to serve as independent witnesses. They could testify only when the two-witness paradigm did not hold. This proved especially important when women might have more access than men to necessary information.

   (
   <a href="#deu20-7">
    20:7
   </a>
   ). The groom becomes betrothed
   <i>
    (eiras)
   </i>
   after he gives a betrothal gift, which is referred to here as a “bride-price.” This implies that the wife is an object acquired by her future husband. (For a different perspective on the institution of betrothal in the Bible, see at
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#g29-17">
    Genesis 29:18
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-16">

   </a>
   .) The Rabbis’ use of the term
   <i>
    kiddushin
   </i>
   for “betrothal” might encourage us to think that women played a more active role in their own betrothals in rabbinic times.
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   is connected to the Hebrew word for “holy,” and “holy” in this context could indicate a relationship recognizing the betrothed woman as more than property. However, rabbinic writings (Tosefta
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   1:1 and BT
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   5b) make it clear that a betrothal is legitimate only if a man “acquires” a woman, whether he uses the term
   <i>
    m’onesset
   </i>
   or
   <i>
    m’kuddeshet
   </i>
   to assert his claim. Betrothal is not considered valid if a woman speaks or acts as the one changing the couple’s status from single to betrothed.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Like the new house and newly planted vineyard (
   <a href="#chap-fn5-3">
    20:5–6
   </a>
   ), the betrothed woman (
   <a href="#deu20-7">
    20:7
   </a>
   ) appears as a partially claimed property for whose full possession a man must take further action. Passages like this indicate that obligations accompanied betrothal (see also
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#D22-23">
    22:23
   </a>
   ) and imply that some men may not have fulfilled them expeditiously. At any given time, significant numbers of betrothed women may have occupied a limbo state wherein they were already designated as “wife” but not entitled to that status. Although biblical sources are silent about mechanisms for canceling betrothals, the Rabbis insisted on divorce to terminate the betrothed couple’s connection (Mishnah
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   1:1, 3:7).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Similar views that betrothal was tantamount to marriage are also found in Roman law. The 2nd century historian Suetonius remarked, “[O]n finding that the spirit of the law was being evaded by betrothal with immature girls…[the Emperor Augustus] shortened the duration of betrothals” (
   <i>
    Augustus
   </i>
   34:1–2). While Suetonius is discussing a binding betrothal that some elite men used to their advantage in order to avoid restrictions upon gifts and the higher taxes owed by unmarried men, the biblical example appears to establish the binding nature of betrothal intentionally. In both Jewish and Roman law and practice, a betrothal either led to a marriage or was terminated in some quiet manner.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In general, historians find references to betrothals only where problems have occurred or are envisioned. The present verse discusses one potential difficulty. A non-Jewish example appears in a legal ruling from Emperors Valerian and Gallienus (dated 259
   <small>
    C.E.
   </small>
   ) concerning a young woman who has been engaged for three years but her fiancé is abroad and unreachable. She would like to end the betrothal but cannot communicate this to him. This young woman’s lawsuit expresses concern that she would be liable to charges
   <a id="page_1160">
   </a>
   of bigamy were she to marry someone else (Judith Evans Grubbs,
   <i>
    Law and Family in Late Antiquity,
   </i>
   1995, pp. 167–8). That such cases required resolution suggests that the interval between betrothal and marriage could be problematic in both Jewish and Roman societies. However, the rarity of references to these cases raises more questions than answers about how betrothals really functioned in ancient Judaism.

    HOF’TIM IS ONE OF
   </small>
   our most neatly packaged Torah portions, beginning with commandments about the necessity for appointing “magistrates and officials” (
   <a href="#deu_16.18-18.22">
    16:18
   </a>
   ) and concluding with a procedure aimed to ensure that people do “what is right in the sight of
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="ltr">
    יהוה
   </span>
   ” (
   <a href="#deu21-9">
    21:9
   </a>
   ). From its opening words to its concluding phrases, this parashah is about righteousness and justice. Yet these concepts are meaningless unless rooted in concrete particulars so they can permeate the lives of those who wish to find meaning in the Torah. These are clearly universal values, but where do we find out about the ways women approach such values and concerns?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Among the commandments recounted in this portion are those about warfare. Can we retain humanity in time of war? The parashah asks us to attempt every other possible measure before war is undertaken, literally to “call her [that is, the city] to peace” (
   <a href="#chap-fn10-3">
    20:10
   </a>
   ), which indicates that war should be considered a last resort in resolving a conflict. All world leaders should familiarize themselves with this ethical teaching: negotiate before fighting by actively calling out in peace to one’s opponent. This recalls the active language about Aaron the priest and his sons in
   <i>
    Pirkei Avot
   </i>
   1:12, “Be like the disciples of Aaron: love peace and pursue it.” Real peace needs strong verbs of “calling” and “pursuing”—and real attempts to forge it.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This concept of calling out in peace would seem to be a place where a value of negotiation rather than fighting has permeated the ways in which the society approaches war. In discussing
   <a href="#chap-fn10-3">
    20:10
   </a>
   ,
   <i>
    Sefer HaChinuch
   </i>
   503, a medieval compilation of mitzvot, states, “The quality of mercy (
   <i>
    rachmaniut)
   </i>
   is a good quality; and it is fitting for us, the holy seed, to behave thus in all matters even with our enemies, worshippers of idols.” This notion that we should always behave with
   <i>
    rachamim
   </i>
   (mercy)—even to an enemy—is one that continues to apply to daily life, as well as to national crises. This would mean that we first would call to that person in peace, prior to arguing or becoming angry, difficult as it may be.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Are there any biblical examples of this mode of discourse? One example concerns a woman who saves an entire city from destruction (II Samuel 20:14–22). That passage tells how Joab, a warrior acting on the king’s behalf, pursues Sheba son of Bichri, the leader of a group that has rebelled and fled to the town of Abel of Beth-maacah. When Joab besieges the city, a “wise woman” employs persuasive rhetoric and feminine imagery to avert war, warning Joab that he risks destroying a “mother city in Israel” (v. 19). Joab assures her that if the people hand over Sheba, he will not attack the city. The woman makes sure that this happens when she convinces the townspeople to cut off Sheba’s head and toss it over the wall. In this case, the wise woman’s sense of mercy and calling out in peace means that one life is sacrificed for the greater good, to avert large-scale bloodshed and ruin.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    Parashat Shof’tim
   </i>
   tells us that if war cannot be avoided,
   <a id="page_1161">
   </a>
   there are humane ways to go about it: “When in your war against a city you have to besiege…you must not destroy its trees” (
   <a href="#chap-fn19-3">
    20:19
   </a>
   ). Why not? The verse continues,
   <i>
    “ki ha-adam etz ha-sadeh,”
   </i>
   which can be read either as “Are the trees of the field human?” or, alternatively, as “for a human is like a tree.” Trees have the ability to draw water into themselves, and nourish themselves. What will sustain and nurture us? An answer may come from the end of the book of Deuteronomy, when Moses charges all the people—men, women, children, and strangers—to listen to and learn “every word of this Teaching (
   <i>
    torah)”
   </i>
   (31:12). Just as we may not cut down fruit trees so they may continue to bear fruit, so we must actively study and teach Torah, striving to incorporate it into our hearts and our minds. That way, the quality of mercy will envelop and permeate our individual lives and our society as a whole.

   Are there distinct ways that women strive to infuse our world with more mercy and peace? Professor Galia Golan, who has studied Israeli-Palestinian dialogue groups for twenty-five years, has found that dialogue groups composed of all women differ in certain respects from mixed-gender groups (“Reflections on Gender in Dialogue,”
   <i>
    Nashim
   </i>
   6, 2003). She has observed that women tend to start from their shared experiences, beginning the conversation not with an abstract, angry summation of the history of the conflict, but with emotional accounts of their personal experiences. According to Golan, women seem more invested in the ability to “dissolve the psychological barriers obstructing resolution of the conflict, by reversing the dehumanization of the enemy that takes place during a prolonged conflict; expanding understanding of the other’s positions; creating empathy with the other side; and thus paving the way for eventual reconciliation.” Dialogue shows unique ways that women call one another to peace, reminding us that through our words and our actions, we possess the potential to “love peace and pursue it.”

   It seems fitting that
   <i>
    parashat Shof’tim,
   </i>
   which is about justice, ends with a body. The crucial aspect of the perplexing ritual of the
   <i>
    eglah arufah
   </i>
   (“the broken-necked heifer”) is to force the living to acknowledge their responsibility to the dead. This ritual provides a means to ascertain responsibility for the corpse. According to the Midrash, kindness to a dead person
   <i>
    (chesed shel emet)
   </i>
   is the truest kindness, for it cannot ever be repaid (
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   96.5; see also
   <a href="15_chapter_12.xhtml#page_297">
    parashat Va-y'chi
   </a>
   ). Why do it? It is the right thing to do, both for the collective of society and for the dead individual.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   It is only in this state of being a collective that a society can operate with justice. Through the totality of these laws, the parashah defines a just society—true kindness and mercy done to all—whether they are brothers, sisters, or enemies, living or dead, human or tree—so that all may find means of sustenance and peace. These values become societal values when they permeate all aspects of life.
