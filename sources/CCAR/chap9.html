   (“he settled”) be­gins the so-called “Joseph story cycle,” which goes on until the end of Gene­sis. In this first portion, the personal drama of Jacob and his family incorporates questions of national identity and survival outside the Prom­ised Land. The reader follows Joseph’s external and internal journey as he grows through hard­ships and tribulations from a spoiled son—favored by his father but hated by his brothers—into a wiser youth in an Egyptian jail.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Two stories of a woman and sex stand lit­erally at the center of the parashah. One is the story of Tamar and her father-in-law Judah (
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
    Genesis 38
   </a>
   ), in which she eventually gives birth to two sons, one of whom will be a fore­father of King David; in this episode Tamar takes extraordinary risks to secure the family’s future (if not her own) by getting pregnant by her father-in-law. In the second story, the wife
   <a id="page_210">
   </a>
   of Potiphar—Joseph’s Egyptian master—attempts to seduce Joseph; he resists, she lies about the circumstances, and he is sent to prison (
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_39.1-23">
    Genesis 39
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The two stories present the men’s behavior as contrasts: Judah eagerly has sex with the veiled Tamar, whereas Joseph resists Potiphar’s wife. (The contrast displays a bias for Joseph tribes as Genesis retrojects a much later, ongo­ing rivalry between the tribes of Joseph in the north and Judah in the south.) In both cases the text presumes that women can be sexually dangerous to men; but Tamar, unlike Potiphar’s wife, is pronounced righteous for ensuring—by using her body—that Judah’s family is not “written out of history.”
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Structurally, the parashah is symmetrical: the first and last episodes portray Joseph in relations to dreams and dream solving. Joseph’s development, the structure suggests, revolves around his dreams, and it is generated by his own actions as well as the behavior of others (his father, brothers, master, Potiphar’s wife). God, though involved, remains in the back­ground.

   These themes surround two stories about a woman’s desire and its consequences. In both, the woman uses a garment to deceive. In both, she furthers the education and development of a man. Yet her actions, while advancing the plot—and the divine plan, so it seems—are not transformational; Judah and Joseph will each have to struggle further to transform self-centeredness into leadership. Tamar’s desire and action are rewarded: she becomes a mother of twins—and is invoked in the book of Ruth within a blessing (4:12). In contrast, the desire of Potiphar’s wife remains unfulfilled and she disappears unnamed. (In early Christian in­terpretation, Jewish post-biblical sources, and Islamic re-tellings including the Qur’an [sura 12], she endures as a symbol of the dangerous foreign woman.)

   These sons of Jacob’s secondary wives seem less valued than the sons of Leah and Rachel. Joseph’s young age (seven­teen) and his status as an eleventh son would justify his family status as similar to theirs.

   This is the reason given for Jacob’s favoring Joseph, although the younger Benjamin would have been a better candidate for that. No reason is given, although presumably this reflects Jacob’s intense love for Ra­chel, Joseph’s (and Benjamin’s) deceased mother.

   Or “long tunic.” The book of Samuel uses the same expression for the garment worn by Tamar, daughter of King David, who tears it after her half-brother Amnon rapes her. It may have been an external marker of her status as a royal virgin daughter (II Samuel 13:18–19). That is, this garment functions as a symbol of its wearer’s special status. (Compare the role of a garment in Tamar’s and Madam Potiphar’s stories, below.)

   Jacob again proves to be an ineffective father, for he does not act to protect Joseph—as he did not protect his daughter, Dinah (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
    Genesis 34

   There is some confusion as to the sequence and participants of what follows, when the brothers act against Joseph; perhaps two accounts have been combined. The result, though, is clear. Joseph is taken to Egypt and is enslaved (v. 28).

   Jacob draws his own conclusion about Joseph’s “death” by looking at the garment that signified Joseph’s favorite status, now immersed in a goat’s blood. The goat whose blood stains the tunic recalls the kids’ skins that Rebekah had placed on Jacob to dupe his father, Isaac, into believing Jacob was Esau (27:16). The allusion is unmistakable: Jacob is deceived by his sons in the same manner he deceived his father—for the same practice of favoring a son. A kid will be part of Tamar’s negotiation with Judah in 38:17, yet another play on the same theme.

   The brothers do not

   Jacob that Joseph is dead—that is, they do not formally lie to him. Instead, they present the fabricated evidence and let him reach his own conclusions. An invitation to recognize items signifying identity is also important later in Tamar’s message to Judah (38:25).

   At the end of this passage, Joseph is in Egypt as a slave; Jacob is in mourning; and the text gives no sign that Joseph’s brothers feel remorse. Perhaps the family’s dysfunction can be explained by the void left after Rachel’s death (

   eaders who wish to learn what will happen to Joseph must wait, because now Tamar and Judah take center stage. This passage disrupts the plotline—just as Tamar and Judah disrupt each other’s lives—and it even seems to be placed out of chronological sequence. We do not know when these events happen. As some early rabbis and Rashi pointed out, however, this episode has literary (thematic and verbal) links to the episodes that precede and follow it, despite the ostensible interruption. For example, Judah deceives his father in the previous episode and is deceived by Tamar (for a good purpose) here; garments—Joseph’s and then Tamar’s—play a central role in both stories, as status markers as well as vehicles of deceit; and the issue of group survival is present in both. This story also looks forward to the next episode. Tamar’s bold desire and the resulting sexual transgression here is comparable (positively or negatively) with Madam Potiphar’s desire for Joseph in the story that follows, in which a garment again figures prominently.

   The present story is part of the ongoing history that leads to King David, founder of Israel’s most illustrious dynasty. According to the Bible, David’s pre-history started when Lot’s daughters, believing that the rest of humankind has been destroyed, deceived their drunken father in order to get pregnant. Two sons, Moab and Ammon, were born (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G19-26">
    19:25–38
   </a>
   ). In the second (present) installment, Tamar deceives Judah and gives birth to twins. In the third installment, Ruth the Moabite (a descendant of Lot’s daughter) marries Boaz (a descendant of Tamar’s son Perez), making her the great-grandmother of David. All three stories involve transgression of norms inscribed elsewhere in the Bible. In all three cases a younger female relative prompts a male to engage in a sexual liaison; the woman initiates the action at considerable risk to herself; and the woman dupes the man to some extent. All three cases result in the birth of one or more sons, which signals divine approval and brings benefit to Israel. Although Tamar is not explicitly identified as foreign, the context suggests that she might be. Thus foreign women become mothers of Israel’s most illustrious dynasty.

   In agreement with the custom of levirate marriage, Judah gives Tamar to his next son, Onan. In levirate marriage (see at
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_24.10-25.16">
    Deuteronomy 25:5–10
   </a>
   ), the wife of a deceased, childless man bears a son for the dead husband by being impregnated by his living brother. The practice applies when brothers live together. The son of such a union inherits the deceased brother’s property. Although this is not stated in the current passage, presumably the son also takes care of his mother, who otherwise–with neither a son nor an inheritance–would have no economic resources apart from what she brought into the marriage.

   Onan’s “sin” is refusing to impregnate his sister-in-law. His fate does not serve to condemn either masturbation or coitus interruptus, two definitions for “onanism” in English dictionaries. Onan’s selfish reasoning is logical (but condemned): he has no interest in producing an heir for his dead brother’s (land) portion, which is in the interest of the household’s structure but not in his own personal interest.

   Judah disposes of Tamar by sending her to her father’s home while keeping her legally bound to his own. His subterfuge is Shelah’s youth. As with Joseph in the previous episode (37:26–27), Judah rids himself of a person whose presence vexes him.

   Judah removes Tamar because he blames her for his sons’ death (compare at v. 10). While his reluctance is humanly understandable, his deception of Tamar is objectionable—and will, eventually, incite her to act.

   </i>
   Tamar is obedient. We learn nothing about Tamar’s response or feelings throughout these occurrences. She is twice widowed (or at least bereft of a partner) in a short time, denied her third man and thus the possibility of all-important motherhood. Moreover, she loses her place in Judah’s household by being sent back to her father but is not released of her duty to this same household. Up to this point, Tamar has no voice but only a passive presence.

   TAMAR EVOLVES FROM VICTIM TO AGENT: DECEPTION, SEX, AND PREGNANCY (38:12–23)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Tamar finally takes matters into her own hands and ensures that she will have a child by deceiving her father-in-law Judah into having sex with her. This would be incest according to the stipulation in the book of Leviticus (“you shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law,”
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
    Leviticus 18:15
   </a>
   ), and is punishable by death (
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.1-8">
    Leviticus 20:12
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Tamar seems to be motivated by the wish to conceive for Judah’s family: she endangers herself, because legally she is bound to Shelah. She deceives Judah by covering herself up—not by pretending to be anything she is not. She, then, falls in with his impulsive cupidity.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Ironically, Judah sees Tamar only when she is covered. Whether a covered face indicated the garb of a prostitute in the ancient Near East is far from certain. That Judah does not recognize Tamar despite the veil—or at least by her voice when they negotiate— is a measure of his eager state. It may also signal a lack of familiarity with his daughter-in-law. She, in fact, does not pretend to anything apart from disguising herself and looking available. She leaves the rest to him. He jumps to the conclusion that she is a prostitute.

   Although Tamar’s specific plan is not recorded, the incentive for her action is clear: Judah’s failure to keep his promise and duty.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Has Tamar planned to have sex with Judah, as the text at least implies? Or did she have some other encounter in mind—and this is why she has disguised herself? At any rate, when Judah suggests having sex with her as a prostitute, she quickly bargains for her presumed wages. She demands a payment; and even if she had no previous such plan, she is quick-witted enough to devise one now.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Judah characteristically suggests a delayed payment (a kid; see at
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_37.35">
    37:31–35
   </a>
   ). Tamar asks for a guaranty: she names Judah’s signet, cord, and staff. In other words, she wants
   <i>
    all
   </i>
   his identity markers (equivalent today to all of one’s major credit cards; see Robert Alter,
   <i>
    The Art of Biblical Narrative
   </i>
   , 1981, p. 9). While practical as a guaranty, these items also convey Tamar’s goal of legitimating herself. Surprisingly, Judah agrees to this exaggerated request. Tamar, if she had no plan to conceive a child prior to the encounter, certainly has this possibility in mind at this point. Judah has now surrendered, symbolically, his identity and social status as patriarch to Tamar.

   (prostitute), here his friend inquires using a different term. Some have suggested that cultic prostitution—namely, sexual activities connected to worship in shrines—existed in ancient Israel. But there is no evidence that this ever existed anywhere in the ancient Near East. Judah’s friend may be attempting to add dignity to a simple sexual transaction by giving it a cultic meaning. The present translation presumes that he is using a more genteel term, with no cultic signification implied.

   Judah’s rash judgment highlights the gender double-standard that the story unmasks and probably critiques. Judah has the right, as head of household, to condemn Tamar to death for her “whoredom,” which is how her pregnancy is seen. The usual biblical punishment for adultery, for both women and men, is by stoning; but Judah demands burning. In the Bible and the ancient Near East, “adultery” concerned only a married woman; and Tamar’s status is still that because, in spite of being sent to her father’s house, the marriage relationship is with the household (Judah’s), not only with the dead husband; and Judah has not released her of this bond (as is possible to do according to the levirate marriage custom,
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_24.10-25.16">
    Deuteronomy 25:7–10

   Tamar, discreetly, does not confront Judah but sends his symbols of identity and allows him to draw his own conclusion (as was done to Jacob upon Joseph’s presumed death,
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_37.35">
    37:32–33

   </i>
   Judah recognizes that Tamar has behaved in a more moral fashion than he has. He does not comment on his own unchecked desire, on his having been deceived, or on the sudden prospect of progeny. The phrasing indicates relativization: according to Judah, Tamar is not
   <i>
    wholly
   </i>
   in the right but is better by comparison with him. Yet this is the first reported occasion where anyone has called Judah to account for his actions; he rises to the occasion by taking responsibility for his earlier words and actions—albeit indirectly. It marks a definite step in his maturation.

    </b>
   </i>
   That he has no more sex with Tamar may be another attempt to whitewash his dubious behavior. At any rate, his response limits Tamar’s success: she becomes a mother (of twins) but remains without a (sexual) partner. She saves Judah’s household (and, historically, Israel) but does not transform her own position back into a married woman (as it should have been had Judah given her Shelah as promised).

   he story of Joseph resumes right where it left him in 37:36—brought down to Egypt and sold as a slave there. While much in this narrative remains ambiguous, it does continue the theme of self-definition in relation to the other peoples, this time focusing on the danger awaiting a male Israelite in a foreign land.

   </b>
   The name of Joseph’s new master resembles Potiphera, the name of the father of Asenath, Joseph’s future wife (41:45). If there is a connection, the Torah does not describe it.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">

   </b>
   Heb.
   <i>
    s’ris paroh;
   </i>
   the noun
   <i>
    saris
   </i>
   means either “a eunuch” or “an official.” Potiphar’s wife’s attraction to Joseph and her attempted seduction of him (see below) might seem different if her husband were understood to be a eunuch.

  <div class="tab-en1">

   God intervenes directly for the first time in this parashah. And undoubtedly Joseph—as a young man in a strange land—would need this divine help.

   This might be a playful reference to his wife, given that in v. 9 below, Joseph tells Madam Potiphar that his master has “withheld nothing from me but you.”

  <div class="tab-en1">

    </b>
   </i>
   Literally, “good looking and good to look at.” The same words described his mother Rachel in 29:17 (translated there as “beautiful of form and of face”). Implicitly, his beauty would serve as Madam Potiphar’s motivation for what follows.

    </b>
   </i>
   Madam Potiphar falls for Joseph and approaches him with this blatant bid. She is painfully direct. We have no details as to her motivation apart from Joseph’s beauty: is it lust only, or love as well? Is her husband a eunuch (see at v. 1), thus justifying her adulterous thought somewhat?

    </b>
   </i>
   Joseph cites his master’s trust and God as the two reasons for his refusal. He does
   <i>
    not
   </i>
   say whether or not he desires his mistress. Indeed, in the absence of data about her—name, looks, age, and attractiveness are all lacking—we may read his refusal either as lack of interest or, conversely, as control of desire due to loyalty to his earthly and divine masters.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">

   </i>
   Why does Joseph go inside when no one else is around, when he knows the mistress should be inside and waiting to pursue him, as she does “day after day”? What is the unspecified “work”? And where are all the household members? The text is ambiguous, as is Joseph’s behavior.

   For the first time, Madam attempts something physical: she gets hold of Joseph’s garment.

    </b>
   </i>
   As when his brothers took his robe (37:23), Joseph here is divested of his garment. This time we have no idea what garment it is, although once again it will be used to deceive.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">

   Joseph votes with his feet, so to speak. His verbal refusal is now backed by action.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="ge_vv.13-20">
   MADAM POTIPHAR LIES AND JOSEPH IS ARRESTED (39:13–20)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   To protect herself, Madam Potiphar accuses Joseph of intending to or actually forcing himself on her. The woman who kept saying laconically, “Lie with me!” now becomes a great rhetor as well as an accomplished liar. She presents her case skillfully to the menservants and to her husband, emphasizing different things in each instance.

   Somehow the menservants are now available again to Madam. In this, her first version of the story, she enlists their sympathy against an upstart foreign (Hebrew) man, brought in by “him”— her husband.

   The wife manages to anger her husband, but we readers remain in the dark: does he believe her? He sends Joseph to prison (v. 20), but this is the royal prison where accused persons await decisions concerning their fate. Potiphar does not punish his wife, which would indicate more clearly that he believes Joseph. The ambiguity remains.

   CONCLUSION: JOSEPH SUCCEEDS IN JAIL (39:21–23)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   At first it appears that Joseph has merely moved from one pit (in the ground in Canaan) to another (in prison in Egypt). Yet the end of this episode links with its beginning. God again has blessed Joseph; the chief jailer likes him and puts him in charge (vv. 21–22) and leaves “everything” to Joseph’s management. Once again, God makes Joseph “succeed.”

   n this concluding unit of the parashah, Joseph grows further in stature. From a callous youth, he becomes a person who cares. He asks two jail mates why they look sad after their dreams and is prepared to help (vv. 7–8). He protests his innocence but forgoes the chance to blame anybody specifically (v. 15). From being a mere dreamer, he becomes a dream interpreter. He is coming closer to the ancient Near East’s “wise man” or “wise courtier” ideal type, which is present also in the portrayals of Mordecai (in the book of Esther) and of Daniel.

   For the first time, the story depicts Joseph telling someone in Egypt how he came to be there. The version he tells the cupbearer is notable for its heavily edited contents. There is not a word about his brothers, or the events in Potiphar’s house. He blames nobody and names no culprit. All he does is establish his innocence so that, upon his restoration, the cupbearer would remember and mention him to the pharaoh. This is also the first time we are told that Joseph actively seeks freedom, or an improvement of his lot, since coming to Egypt.

   From an arrogant and gossipy boy, Joseph has grown into a young man who refuses adultery with his master’s wife, who suffers in prison, who does not tell on his brothers when the opportunity arises. Clearly, he can now exercise control over his own behavior and emotions, which he could not do earlier—and which is a prerequisite for his future role. In addition, from a dreamer he has evolved into a dream interpreter. He is poised to act on dreams to the benefit of all: his adopted land, his own self, and his original family.

   <small>
    AMAR
   </small>
   provide two models of the feminine and help to forge the contrasting characterizations of Joseph and Judah.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Potiphar’s wife is overtly sensual and verbally aggressive. Like the negative archetype of the feminine in one passage of the book of Proverbs (7:1–23), she tempts the young man into sexual impropriety. Potiphar’s wife serves as a test in the initiation of Joseph, the young wisdom hero who refuses to allow a woman to make him unfaithful to his master.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Tamar, a young childless widow, becomes a trickster, a marginal figure who succeeds in indirect ways, by deceiving those in power. The trickster’s marginality may be rooted in gender, age, economic or social status. Biblical tricksters include Abraham (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    Genesis 12:1–10
   </a>
   ), Jacob (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_27.1-28.9">
    Genesis 27
   </a>
   ), Rebekah (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_27.1-28.9">
    Genesis 27
   </a>
   ), and Tamar. Tales of tricksters appeal to the underdog side of each of us, but they may have special appeal among groups who feel themselves out of power—for example, women in a world dominated by men.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
    Genesis 38
   </a>
   , the qualities of the feminine that limited Tamar become her source of strength. When Judah sends her back to her father with empty promises of giving her his third son in good time, Tamar, like other marginal females in ancient Israelite social structure, is caught betwixt and between social categories available to women—as virgins or as child-producing, faithful wives. Eventually, Tamar takes matters into her own hands. Dressing as a prostitute and standing at the crossroads in a double symbolization of her marginality, she becomes pregnant by Judah. Wisely she has demanded and then kept his pledges, symbols of his identity and status. Judah—who is no more appealing in this tale than in the selling of Joseph—orders that Tamar be burned alive when he hears she is pregnant, dismissing her with two words. But she—clever girl—produces the tokens that identify Judah as the father, and even he must admit he has been bested. Judah, coconspirator in the exile of Joseph, is one of the many biblical males, including Samson, Sisera, and Isaac, who are tricked by women’s wiles. It is Tamar’s right to bear children in Judah’s line, and the twins indicate abundant fertility. She will be the ancestress of kings. Tamar’s power is indirect, circumscribed by the realm of procreation and supported by tricksterism. It is a power, nevertheless, that is celebrated in the biblical tale.

   (38:1). Pondering why the story of Joseph is interrupted by events in the life of his brother Judah, the Rabbis draw our attention to the pivotal roles women play in the lives of both men. Midrash
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   85.2 explains that Judah’s and Joseph’s adventures are juxtaposed “to bring the stories of Tamar and Potiphar’s wife into close proximity, in order to teach that as the former was actuated by a pure motive, so was the latter. For Rabbi
   <a id="page_227">
   </a>
   Joshua ben Levi said: Potiphar’s wife saw by her astrological arts that she was to produce a child by Joseph, but she did not know whether it was to be from her—or from her daughter.” In fact, as related in
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   86.3, the Rabbis believed that the woman whom Joseph eventually married was none other than the daughter of Potiphar and his wife, since they identified Potiphar with “Potiphera priest of On,” Joseph’s future father-in-law (41:45).

   (38:14). For the Rabbis, Tamar’s heroic actions displayed the where-withal, foresight, and fortitude of a matriarch such as Rebekah. They allude to this association in
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   60.15 and 85.7: “Two covered themselves with a veil, and each gave birth to twins—Rebekah and Tamar.” Tamar’s behavior is considered a praiseworthy response to a situation of injustice.

   (38:16). The Rabbis saw Tamar’s deception as foreordained since they believed that the messiah will ultimately arise from her long-ago union with Judah.
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   85.8 recounts that an angel intervened on Tamar’s behalf in order to make sure that Judah did not pass her by: “Rabbi Yohanan said: He wished to go on, but the blessed Holy One made the angel who is in charge of desire appear before him and say to him: ‘Where are you going, Judah? From where are kings and redeemers to arise?’ Thus:
   <i>
    he turned toward her.”

   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_37.35">

In that account, Amram, Moses’ father, speaks of her as “our mother Tamar.” The emphasis falls on her determination to perpetuate the line of Judah despite risk—which Amram uses to encourage the people to continue to perpetuate life despite their slavery (

   (39:7). Tamar and Potiphar’s wife are both presented in midrashic texts as powerful, beautiful, clever, and seductive women. However, while Tamar is universally praised because she ensured the future destiny of the tribe of Judah—from which the Davidic dynasty would eventually spring—Potiphar’s wife emerges as a more ambiguous figure. She is most often depicted as both seducer and seduced. She is portrayed as an immoral woman who meant to taunt and tease Joseph but was overwhelmed by his great beauty. According to
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   87.10, when Joseph was in prison, she would say to him: “See how I have made you suffer. By your life, I will persecute you in other ways too.” The midrash continues: “She went so far as to place an iron fork under his neck so that he should have to lift up his eyes and look at her. Yet in spite of that he would not look at her.” Rabbi Huna explains that Jacob’s
   <a id="page_228">
   </a>
   outcry—“a wild animal has devoured him” (37:33)—was actually a moment of clairvoyance in which the distraught father perceived Mrs. Potiphar’s wicked ways and her obsession with Joseph (
   <i>

   84.19). Indeed, the more depraved and seductive she acted, the more commendable was Joseph’s resistance and display of honor.

    N TERMS OF THE BIBLICAL WORLDVIEW,
   </small>
   Tamar’s tragedy is evident: she has lost her husband, and she has no offspring to secure her status as a widow and give her life purpose. Tired of leaving her fate to male relatives, Tamar takes action to secure her own position, thereby joining the circle of matriarchs who exemplify action to protect Israelite destiny.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en" style="margin-top:1em;">
   <i>
    When the Family Constellation Changes.
   </i>
   As the Bible tells the story, Judah and Tamar are in-laws who have reached a crisis point in their relationship. Why? As Carol Meyers explains (
   <i>
    Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Women in Context,
   </i>
   1988, pp. 133, 183), a young woman typically married into her husband’s extended family household. The new wife was expected to conform to household norms.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   At first, Judah is more than willing to support Tamar’s rights. It is he who prompts Onan to perform his duty (38:8); however, when Onan dies in turn, Judah inwardly blames Tamar (38:11), although the reader knows that she is innocent (38:7, 10). Clearly, there is a failure of communication. Judah tells Tamar he will eventually allow her access to Shelah, while he privately intends no such thing. For her part, Tamar correctly surmises Judah’s true intentions, but she never confronts him, discusses it with him, or attempts less radical measures, such as mediation. Evidently, Judah’s abiding sense of loss and resentment are blocking his reconciliation with Tamar. Because of Judah’s failure to heal, Tamar is also unable to move on.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Even now, any new family member—whether spouse, in-law, or child—begins as an outsider. The attendant changes in family dynamics bring accompanying stresses. If conversion or adoption is involved, the difficulties of adjustment may be compounded, requiring increased patience and sensitivity. Recriminations, too, have never been uncommon when premature death occurs in a family.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   <i>
    Recovering from the Loss of a Husband.
   </i>
   Tamar’s actions following the loss of her spouse involve extreme risk, but they are not reckless; she has a plan. Spousal loss should not force anyone into desperate acts. In modern terms, Tamar’s predicament cautions women today not to abdicate their financial security to others. They should be aware of and involved in household decisions concerning retirement plans, mortgages, and taxes. Too many widows emerge from mourning to discover financial troubles they had not known existed, and, apart from any monetary crisis that may ensue, are left with a tainted memory of their loved one and an ensuing anger that is hard to resolve.

  <div class="tab-en1">
   On a less dire note, entering widowhood nowadays may not be dangerous, but it can be frightening to face life as a single after years of partnership. Tamar’s courage in the face of genuine adversity serves as a
   <a id="page_229">
   </a>
   model for those who fear entering a social situation alone for the first time, and it may help reduce that fear to realistic proportions. After all, no one in America today will try to burn them for exiting their fathers’ houses, even were they to turn up pregnant.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Widows today should remember that they are not genuinely alone. Just as Tamar could fall back on her family of origin, the bereaved should not avoid turning to their support networks of family and friends. If these do not exist or are inadequate, there are communal resources—and new interests and people yet to explore.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Tamar eventually rises from her mourning and responds to her loss by taking action that will produce meaning for her life. Producing an heir is not the only way to create a legacy. Many are the widows and widowers who have responded to their loss through volunteer work and community involvement. Victor Frankl, in his work
   <i>
    Man’s Search for Meaning
   </i>
   (1959), taught that while we may have no control over circumstances in which we find ourselves, we have utter freedom in how we respond to those circumstances, even if only in the attitude we choose to assume in response. Tamar teaches us not to become immobilized by loss. Mourn—but then move to find ongoing purpose.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en" style="margin-top:1em;">
   <i>
    The Role of the Foreigner.
   </i>
   Had Tamar been kin, mention of her lineage would be expected; thus it seems that she was foreign. Yet this matters little to Judah: he resents Tamar because he associates her with the loss of his sons, not because of her ethnic identity. Judah had himself been married to a Canaanite, and it is he who arranged Er’s marriage with Tamar in the first place (38:6). Moreover, in Tamar’s time, no conversion rite, as such, existed; she makes her affiliation clear by aligning herself with the destiny of Judah’s household—and thus with the destiny of Israel.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Non-Israelite origin connects Tamar to the story of Potiphar’s wife that follows in
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_39.1-23">
    Genesis 39
   </a>
   . Placing the story of a good woman next to that of a bad woman clarifies, from a biblical standpoint, the meaning of both goodness and badness in women. This juxtaposition of good and bad models, known to literary structuralists as “binary opposition,” is found again in the case of the widow of Zarephath (in Phoenicia), who aids Elijah in I Kings 17 and is in counterpoint to that other Phoenician woman, Jezebel, who hounds Elijah. Women are not the only foreign exemplars: the good Kenites are repeatedly balanced with the hated Amalekites (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.22-17.16">
    Exodus 17–18
   </a>
   ; Judges 4; and I Samuel 15:6). Such stories provide examples of how a foreigner or foreign people should behave, and another less edifying one of how they often did behave. In the context of the Bible, such passages represent ethnic tensions of the past and highlight the uncertainty of trusting outsiders. For the modern world, they serve as a reminder for us to judge individuals by their actions and attitudes, rather than by labels and assumptions.

    Rachel sits in the tent

    and gathers each curl closer

    to hide them under the silken cap

    of her little daughter Joseph,

    Rachel brought forth a son

    And the mother reads the future

   <div class="poem">
    in the dark hair of her daughter:
   </div>
   <div class="poem">
    dreams will cast you in a pit,
   </div>
   <div class="poem">
    a foreign court soon after.

    The little one sits in the tent,

    she hears the words of her mother,

    the shocks grow more extreme:

    you will be locked in prison

    Dreams will save you, daughter,

    will cast you in a pit.
