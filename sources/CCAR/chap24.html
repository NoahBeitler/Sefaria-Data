    EVITICUS AIMS TO
   </small>
   shape the Israelites into a holy people and to safeguard the purity that it considers essential for contact with the holy. The Hebrew name,
   <i>
    Vayikra
   </i>
   (“and [God] called”), refers to God’s summoning Moses and giving him the instructions that constitute most of the book. The English name “Leviticus” refers to Levi, a son of Leah and Jacob and the ancestor of the priests.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Leviticus reflects the perception that God’s created world is fundamentally harmonious, good, and orderly (as in
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis 1
   </a>
   ). To preserve God’s orderly world, where everything has an assigned place, Leviticus specifies what must be done whenever boundaries are wrongfully crossed, be they boundaries of the body, time, or space—such as between sacred and non-sacred, or between life and death. In this book’s worldview, anyone who breaks God’s ordained harmony can—and must—repair it. Rituals, including sacrifices, serve to cancel or neutralize damage done to the created order and thereby restore the equilibrium.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In Leviticus, a person’s body, the sanctuary, and the community each constitute a microcosm of the universe in its sacred aspect. Each reflects and has an impact upon the larger, integrated whole. Consequently, holiness and purity are relevant to all aspects of Israelite life; they apply not merely to the sanctuary, but also to the body and the home. Therefore, the book legislates laws about food (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_11.1-47">
    Leviticus 11
   </a>
   ), sexual relations (
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
    Leviticus 18
   </a>
   and
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.1-8">
    20
   </a>
   ), and ethics (
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
    Leviticus 19
   </a>
   ), in addition to providing extensive instructions about sacrificial
   <a id="page_568">
   </a>
   offerings (
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    Leviticus 1–7
   </a>
   ). Although the priests have a unique role, all Israelites must be holy, for God is holy (see at
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.1-37">
    19:2
   </a>
   ).

  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Contemporary scholars ascribe Leviticus to priestly circles also responsible for other portions of the Torah (such as
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis 1
   </a>
   , the Tabernacle accounts in
   <a href="22_chapter_19.xhtml#exo_25.10-40">
    Exodus 25–40
   </a>
   , and most of Numbers). Such scholars often differentiate between two priestly writings: the Priestly collection (
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    Leviticus 1–16
   </a>
   ) that they call “P,” and the Holiness Code (
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
    Leviticus 17–26
   </a>
   ) that they call “H,” with
   <a href="36_chapter_33.xhtml#levi_27.1-34">
    Leviticus 27
   </a>
   as an appendix. While P emphasizes the unique privileges and responsibilities of the priests (defined as Aaron and his sons), H widens the notion of holiness to apply to all Israelites. For P, the priests (
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   ) and the Tabernacle are the exclusive intermediaries (and guardians) with regard to God’s holiness; H, however, focuses on the people themselves as the vehicle for God’s holiness.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-eninb">
   Although Leviticus mentions only one woman by name (the otherwise unknown Shelomith; see at
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_24.11">
    24:11
   </a>
   ), many of its teachings clearly apply to women as members of the Israelite community. Like the men, women are bound by the book’s various laws and must refrain from actions that may contaminate God’s sanctuary or the community. In addition, Leviticus includes three types of laws uniquely relevant to women:
  </div>
  <div class="list1b">
   1.
   <span class="space">
   </span>
   <i>
    Regulations about the processes by which women regain access to the sanctuary after childbirth and menstruation.
   </i>
   These conditions, like other conditions that pertain to the nexus between life and death (such as seminal emission for men), require ritual purification before normal life patterns may be resumed (see at
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    Leviticus 12
   </a>
   and
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">
    15
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="list1b">
   2.
   <span class="space">
   </span>
   <i>
    Laws about sexual relations.
   </i>
   Regulations about prohibited sexual relationships demarcate for an Israelite male those women whose sexuality belongs to another man and are therefore forbidden to him; they also identify kinship structures that help locate women in the family constellation (see at
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_18.1-30">
    Leviticus 18
   </a>
   and
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.9-21">
    20
   </a>
   ). Laws like these indicate that typically a woman’s sexuality is only partly under her control. For example, as Judith Wegner notes, “an unmarried girl’s biological function belongs legally to her father.” According to Wegner, this does not mean a man could do with his daughter as he pleased. Rather, “the Torah certainly expects a father to protect his daughter’s chastity until she reaches puberty and is married off” (“Leviticus,” 1992, p. 45; but see

    A Call to Approach God

   (“and [God] called”) introduces one of the most challenging texts for contemporary readers. This portion begins the instructions on how to approach God by means of sacrificial offerings. Animal sacrifices are foreign to most modern readers and offensive to many. They were, however, integral to most recorded worship practices in the ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean regions. Sacrifice continued well into the Common Era as the major way to approach the gods and to thank or appease them. Provisions for animal sacrifice are also included in the Koran, the sacred text of Islam.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Scholars of religion, attempting to understand the practice of animal sacrifice in the ancient world, suggest a number of possible explanations for why the practice endured. The rationale most frequently expressed in extrabiblical sources is that gods need to be fed as well as propitiated. Furthermore, life and fertility are gifts from the gods—gifts for which humans must show appreciation by offering something precious in return. In agricultural societies, the intimate connection between livestock and persons fostered an understanding that certain domestic animals could substitute for a human life. While these suggested explanations pertain to explicit reasons, some scholars link the pervasiveness of sacrifices in antiquity with a community’s unacknowledged desire to reduce violence. Ritual slaughtering of animals as opposed to random killings, the explanation goes, would channel people’s aggression into a socially constructive function and away from other forms of violence.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Israelite religion officially rejected an older idea that God requires sustenance like human beings. Nevertheless, it kept the
   <i>
    practice
   </i>
   of offering sacrifices as a way of serving God. The Hebrew word usually translated as “sacrifice,”
   <i>
    korban
   </i>
   , implies coming close to God (the root
   <i>
    k-r-b
   </i>
   that forms
   <i>
    korban
   </i>
   also means “to come near”) and is better translated as “near-offering.” One underlying rationale for many biblical sacrifices is to express gratitude for one’s good fortune; another rationale is that it is a means of returning the best to God—much like the payment of rent to a venerable landowner. In addition, certain sacrifices are aimed at helping people deal with the guilt of wrongdoing and with the impurity of sin, so that Israel would be on good terms with their Deity.

  </div>
  <div class="image0">

  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Sociologically speaking, sacrificial rites in antiquity served to bind community by providing a common meal that made scarce and costly meat available to many. Certain sacrifices
   <a id="page_570">
   </a>
   functioned like a neighborhood barbecue celebrating a modern holiday: an opportunity to socialize and to eat well. Leviticus, however, seems to sanction killing an animal and eating its meat only as part of a sacrificial offering.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Although sacrifices form the major focus of this parashah, the concluding section expresses a deep concern with social and economic justice (see
   <a href="#L5-20">
    5:20–26
   </a>
   ). Defrauding another person constitutes a sin against God; yet one must make amends to the injured party before offering a sacrifice to God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The legislation in this parashah applies equally to Israelite women and men. Its terminology is pointedly gender inclusive, implying that women are expected to bring offerings. A later passage,
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#L12-8">
    Leviticus 12:6–8
   </a>
   , explicitly addresses a situation in which a woman must bring two of the sacrifices mentioned in this parashah. Other biblical texts also describe women’s participation in sanctuary-centered activities. In I Samuel 1, Elkanah’s wives—Hannah and Peninnah—regularly visit the sanctuary with him, as do his daughters. Moreover, he and Hannah present and slaughter the offering that she has brought there, as payment for a vow. Many scholars hold that women’s religious activities were even more extensive than can be garnered from these texts (see
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#page_587">
    Another View
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="fm-07.xhtml#page_xli">
    “Women in Ancient Israel—An Overview.”
   </a>
   ) Nevertheless, Leviticus authorizes only men from the family of Aaron to serve as priests in the sanctuary (see in the next parashah at
   <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
    6:2
   </a>
   ).

    Procedures for Three Basic offerings

   he first unit of Leviticus functions as an overview and describes the “what” and “how” of the most common sacrifices that Israelites must bring. The emphasis falls on the types of offerings and the procedures for conducting the sacrifices, rather than on the occasions calling for sacrifices.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This unit reads like an instruction manual, which it may have been. But note that these instructions are to be disclosed to all Israel, whereas in other cultures priests typically guard the knowledge about their professional rites of worship. Although Leviticus preserves the priests’ privileged monopoly regarding the service at the altar and its sacrifices, these instructions demystify the priests’ role by making knowledge about their activities known to every Israelite.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The anthropologist Mary Douglas observes that the arrangement of the offerings on the altar recreates a movement from the outside (of the animal’s body) to the center and toward greater holiness. A similar journey takes place as a person enters the Tabernacle, or as Moses ascends Mount Sinai (
   <i>
    Leviticus as Literature,
   </i>
   1999, ch. 4). Douglas also notes the relationship between what is offered on the altar and what a person may eat (
   <a href="29_chapter_26.xhtml#levi_11.1-47">
    Leviticus 11
   </a>
   ): The meat that one may offer God is the same as that which one may eat. The parallels make the human body an analogue to the Tabernacle: a holy place designated for serving God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Sacrifice takes place at the altar located at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. The procedure for most types of sacrifices is similar: First, someone brings a sacrificial offering either on their own behalf or on behalf of their household (some or all of whom may be present); that person presents the sacrificial offering to a priest. When the offering is an animal, the person lays a hand on it. Next, the animal is slaughtered, possibly by the person who provides the offering. (Most likely over time, the priests as experts assumed the task of slaughtering on the offerer’s behalf.) The priest collects the animal’s blood and dashes it on the four corners of the altar—apparently as a purifying substance. Afterward, the animal is skinned and sectioned (probably by the priest and his assistants), and its entrails and skin are washed. Finally, the priest prepares the fire and then lays down the appropriate pieces of the animal on the altar for the sacrifice. Burnt offerings are burned completely, while other offerings provide meat for the priests or the community as a whole. Eating the appropriate portions of the offering constitutes the final step of the ritual.

   BURNT OFFERING
   <i>
    —olah
   </i>
   (1:1–17)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Hebrew name of this offering,
   <i>
    olah,
   </i>
   comes from the root
   <i>
    e-l-h,
   </i>
   meaning “to go up,” and expresses the idea that the entire offering “goes up” to God as smoke, the substance into which the animal has been transformed by fire. The burnt offering is unique because all of it must be burned, except for the skin. The English term “holocaust” originally referred to this specific sacrifice. The text makes no mention of the purpose of the ritual. The idea seems to be that this gift of life belongs completely to God—who gives life. It may express a recognition that a part of what one has received from God must return completely to God. God demands of Abraham a burnt offering, namely, Isaac (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_21.22-22.19">
    Genesis 22
   </a>
   ).
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_23.1-44">
    Leviticus 23
   </a>
   is one of several passages that describe occasions that require a burnt offering.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The fact that the burnt offering usually appears first in a series of sacrifices suggests that its purpose may be to open up communication with the Divine; if so, then that goal would be accomplished by manifesting generosity—giving part of one’s wealth to God (David Stein, personal communication).

    Exodus (40:38

   Leviticus begins with an address that is intended for the people as a whole, not only for an elite group of priests. In so doing, the book establishes the principle that priestly activities are open to scrutiny by the people as a whole. Just as this “manual” for priestly activities is to be taught to all Israel, so the legal precepts of the Torah are to be taught to all the Israelites (for example,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 21:1
   </a>
   ).

   The Hebrew has “when an
   <i>
    adam
   </i>
   from among you.” Because the word
   <i>
    adam
   </i>
   refers to a human being in a generic sense (see at
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_1.1-2.3">
    Genesis 1:26
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge_5.1-32">
    5:2
   </a>
   ), the language of this verse makes clear that the laws apply to both women and men. The subsequent verbs and pronouns appear in a masculine form only for the sake of agreement with
   <i>
    adam
   </i>
   as a grammatically masculine noun. (Hebrew has no neutral “it”; all verbs take a masculine or feminine form that matches the grammatical gender of the subject; in this case, as in many others, the noun’s grammatical gender has nothing to do with social gender. For example, “a table” is grammatically masculine and “a door” is feminine.)

   ) are derived from the same root,
   <i>
    k-r-b,
   </i>
   meaning “to come near.” Thus, the language of sacrifice carries a sense of coming close to the Divine, describing a safe way to interact with the supreme power. The precautions taken by ancient worshippers and priests (such as approaching only in specified ways and times) are analogous to those taken by modern technicians when handling radioactive material: potent energy that can heal and kill must be approached with maximum attention to protective procedures.

   . It is not clear what the animal’s sex symbolizes. Nicole Ruane, who examines the sacrificial system with regard to the sex of its victims, concludes that the highest level of holiness is symbolized in Leviticus by perfect masculinity.

   . The Torah does not specify who slaughters the animal-the one who has brought the offering (hence either a woman or a man) or the priest. As Mayer Gruber points out, ancient Near Eastern texts and pictures portray sacrificial slaughter by women as well as by men (“Women in the Cult,” 1992, n. 37). The story of the woman in En-dor, who slaughters a stall-fed calf in her home to feed King Saul, suggests that it was considered unremarkable that a woman slaughtered large animals (I Samuel 28:24).

   Blood represents life. Thus,

    Leviticus 17:11
   </a>
   states: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood.…It is the blood, as life, that effects expiation.” In Leviticus, the blood of ritually slaughtered animals functions as the element that erases impurities, much like a disinfectant is used in the modern world to remove unwelcome bacteria.

   This refrain concludes the descriptions of other offerings as well. It signals the belief that the smoke reaches God, who welcomes this offering.

   (“meal offering”) are semolina (the choice sifted granules from ground wheat kernels), olive oil, and frankincense. The offerer can prepare it in one of three ways: griddle, pan, or oven. According to
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.1-5.26">
    Leviticus 5:11

   The second type of

   refers to ripe grain from the new crop that is roasted and then made into grits. The priest offers a token portion of the roasted grain mixture to God. This offering may represent the produce of the earth returned, in gratitude, to the God responsible for the fertility of the land.

   WELL-BEING OFFERING—

  <div class="tab-enin">
   The offering of
   <i>
    sh’lamim,
   </i>
   translated here as “sacrifice of well-being,” resembles the burnt offering but with one main difference: only a portion of it “turns into smoke” (see below for details). The largest part of the sacrifice is distributed between priests and offerers, thus providing food for the Israelites. This passage does not mention a specific occasion, but subsequent instructions link the
   <i>
    sh’lamim
   </i>
   with celebrations and show that often this offering was to be brought after a burnt offering. It constitutes the basic form of sacrifice for feast days (
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu_12.1-16.17">
    Deuteronomy 12:11–12
   </a>
   ). This means that when Israelites brought sacrifices, some offerings were solely for God, as it were, and some to be eaten by community members.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   This practice turns the eating of meat into a sacred act (
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">

   ) and reflects the concern for taking life for human consumption; the sacrifice has nothing to do with atonement. As Jacob Milgrom observes, this ritual allowed the Israelites to acknowledge the miracles of their lives and express gratitude for them (

   These verses describe the parts of the animal that are consumed in their entirety. The procedures are similar to the burnt offering, except that only specified portions of the animal are placed on the altar to be burnt: certain fatty portions, including the fat that covers the entrails and the kidneys and is on the loins, as well as an appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys. The rest is divided between the priest and the one making the offering.

   The prohibition against eating blood is explicitly linked elsewhere with the conviction that blood represents life (see at

   and
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#L17-11">

   <a href="14_chapter_11.xhtml#ge_45.1-28">

    Procedures for Offerings to Restore Order

   and
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.1-5.26">
    5
   </a>
   link two major types of offerings to offenses that undermine the balance of the created order. The book of Leviticus maintains that God has created a harmonious world and that persons must—and can—restore that harmony even when they have transgressed and thereby damaged such harmony. The earlier, conventional English terms for the two offerings in this unit are “sin offering” and “guilt offering” (based on the root meanings of the Hebrew names of these sacrifices; see below). But the more current terminology, which replaces “sin” with “purgation,” and “guilt” with “reparation,” better captures the function of these offerings: the purgation offering clears away the damaging substance; and the reparation offering reconstructs or restores the system to its normative, harmonious wholeness.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   These offerings take place in a world in which the spiritual was perceived as integral to the physical—and thus directly affecting the physical. Israel’s neighbors (and no doubt many Israelites) believed in demons, a view that Leviticus rejects by ignoring it (see the lone, obscure mention of
   <i>
    se’irim
   </i>
   in
   <a href="32_chapter_29.xhtml#levi_17.1-16">
    17:7
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Nonetheless, Leviticus regards (invisible) spiritual and moral transgressions as causes of physical (visible and invisible) harm that can be “managed” by proper rituals. At the most immediate level of priestly concern, the impurity of transgressions is considered capable of becoming airborne and contaminating the sanctuary. Thus, the purgation offering aims to cleanse the sanctuary of such contamination, much like a disinfectant purges a hospital room from harmful bacteria.

  <div class="tab-en">
   The name of this sacrifice,
   <i>
    chatat,
   </i>
   is derived from the same root as the word
   <i>
    chet
   </i>
   (sin); it means “that which cancels out sin.” The English term “purgation” (purification or decontamination) succinctly captures the ritual’s function. The analogy between the Tabernacle and the larger world—microcosm and macrocosm—means that such acts have even wider ramifications. In a symbolic sense, one is restoring order to the world as a whole.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The
   <i>
    chatat
   </i>
   follows upon any accidental—not deliberate—violation of certain ethical and ritual prohibitions, of things “not to be done” (
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.1-5.26">

   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#L4-27">

   ). The person who brings the
   <i>

   </i>
   then “shall be forgiven” (

   This offering takes different forms depending on the social status of the transgressor. The different steps indicate greater degrees of responsibility and culpability, with infractions by priests being subject to the most stringent procedures. The rules thus emphasize accountability rather than privilege.

One could conclude that a female might represent a greater loss in terms of long-term investment (because more females than males are necessary for reproduction, and because females also produce milk). There is no mention as to what is to be done with the parts of the animal that are not burned on the altar. Usually, the remainder is shared by the priest and the offerer in the case of a well-being offering.

   This passage includes types of violations of which only the offender would be aware. These constitute what we might call ethical offenses, like withholding information in legal situations (
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.1-5.26">
    v. 1
   </a>
   ), or ritual violations, like touching something considered impure (

   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.1-5.26">
    4:1–5:13

   </i>
   This is the first specific transgression that the book of Leviticus mentions. It refers to a person who has refused to disclose information that is needed to establish the facts of a legal case. Such an offense might seem minor, but in fact it compromises a person’s integrity and also undermines the legal system. An after-the-fact ritual cannot change the external circumstances of the case, but it provides the transgressor with a means to amend symbolically a wrongdoing that has damaged the fabric of society and self.

   <i>
    asham,
   </i>
   elsewhere means “guilt,” which is why in English it is sometimes called a “guilt offering.” The more recent term, “reparation offering,” more accurately reflects the purpose of the ritual, which is to repair the damage done in specified cases. In contrast to the earlier instructions in this parashah, the section on the reparation offering focuses on the nature of the transgression and on payment of reparations, not on the presentation and disposition of the sacrificial offering. Restoration involves directly compensating those who have been harmed by the act.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The section begins with reparation of damage done to sacred items and concludes with damage to persons. These laws echo the Decalogue (

   ;
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu_4.44-5.30">
    Deuteronomy 5:6–18
   </a>
   ) in that crimes against another person are considered a crime against God and thus require similar reparation. The assertion that crimes against persons are also crimes against God also stands out as the central message of biblical prophets like Amos or Isaiah, and it constitutes a distinctive contribution of the Bible to Western ethics. Leviticus presents this idea, radical for its own time, as the final point in this parashah.

    LL OF THIS PARASHAH
   </small>
   and most of the next one contain instructions for sacrifices, offered by individuals (either women or men) and by households at the central shrine. Yet the extensive focus on communal rites of worship in this part of the Torah may create the impression that other religious practices were either non-existent or discouraged. However, that impression would be erroneous, for—as in traditional societies everywhere—religious activities carried out
   <i>
    only
   </i>
   by women were part of Israelite household life. Such practices are virtually invisible in the Bible. Nevertheless, archeological evidence, interpreted in light of ethnographic data and anthropological models, allows us to recognize this aspect of women’s lives in the biblical period.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The gender-specific religious behaviors of women centered on the reproductive process. Women faced the possibility of infertility, complications of pregnancy, and insufficient lactation; they were also aware of high infant mortality. Today we deal with these reproductive problems medically. But in antiquity women carried out procedures—which we might view as superstitious—that were fundamentally religious in nature. That is, women performed rituals both to avert the evil forces (like Lilith) believed to be the cause of problems and also to attract benevolent spirits in order to achieve reproductive success.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Such practices were generally apotropaic (protective). Women might wear shiny jewelry or amulets to keep the “evil eye” away. They would tie a red thread around an infant’s limb for similar reasons, a practice that continues to this day among certain Jewish groups. They might keep a lamp burning in or near a birthing room, and they would salt and swaddle a newborn (see Ezekiel 16:4). Other practices, involving votive figurines and fertility symbols known from other ancient cultures, can also be identified. Such religious behaviors focus on the welfare of childbearing women and their offspring. No doubt women considered them necessary for the creation and safeguarding of new life. Carrying out such practices, which they believed could be effective, would have given women a sense of agency in dealing with considerable reproductive risk. This also means that they were ritual experts no less than the priests in charge of the official sacrificial regimen set forth in
   <i>
    Vayikra.

    alef:
   </i>
   Moses, who was extremely close to God, maintained his humility. A third commentator explains that the Torah does not include an exhortation to be humble because were humility to be commanded, it would no longer be humility. Rather, the commentator concludes, every person should cultivate true humility

   ). One rabbi notes that until now, God had spoken to Moses in open places—such as the burning bush in the wilderness, Midian, and Sinai, where God’s presence was public and without bounds. Thus “a (lowly) maidservant saw at the Sea of Reeds what even the prophet Ezekiel was not privileged to see.” However, once the Tent of Meeting was erected, God chose concealment over openness. This is a sign of divine modesty, since what is private is seen by God as more precious

   <i>
    Tanchuma, Vayikra

   4 (ed. Buber, II, p. 475), God chose to leave the high heavens and descend to the earth, to the Tent of Meeting, for love of Israel.

   <i>
    yakriv),
   </i>
   one commentator says, “When we want to draw close (
   <i>
    I’hitkarev)
   </i>
   to God, we must offer something of our own, that is, our ‘evil inclination.’” Another suggests that this verse calls upon individuals to offer God their innermost strength and will, to submit to God, and to dedicate all of their acts to the service of God
   <i>
    (Itturei Torah
   </i>
   on Leviticus 1:2, IV, p. 10).

  <div class="tab-enin">
   One commentator on this verse cites BT
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   40b, “Those individuals who perform a single mitzvah draw themselves and the entire world toward righteousness.” Responding to the mixing of the singular and the plural verb forms in
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    Leviticus 1:2
   </a>
   , another interpretation urges that we each acknowledge that we realize our full potential through our bonds to the community of Israel

    1:4
   </a>
   ). While the Rabbis exempted women from the legal obligation to lay hands upon one’s burnt offering, some rabbis permitted them to participate in this mitzvah “if they choose” (BT
   <i>
    Rosh Ha-Shanah
   </i>
   33a;

   (
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#L1-3">
    1:5
   </a>
   ). The first verb of this verse is impersonal, and it mentions the priests only after the animal has been killed. Citing these details of wording, the Rabbis validated animal slaughter by any lay person—male or female—whether for a sacrificial offering or for purely human consumption (Midrash
   <i>

   ). Midrash
   <i>
    Tanchuma, Vayikra

   5 (ed. Buber, p. 475) notes that this is the only instance in the prolonged discussion of sacrifices in which the word for “person” is

   instead of
   <i>
    ish

   (man) or
   <i>

   <i>
    parashat Vayikra
   </i>
   introduces Leviticus, a book that sits smack in the center of the Torah like a tough vein of gristle that runs through a tender, juicy steak. Most of Leviticus is hard to digest.
   <i>
    Vayikra
   </i>
   is an instruction manual, and technical writing rarely yields compelling drama or inspiring ethical teachings. The language of our portion is formal, stylized, repetitive, precise. Yet the dryness of language cannot quite disguise the essential problem with what transpires here: the portion is slippery with blood. Rising up from the page are the screams of dying animals, the pungent stink of smoke and burning flesh.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The priestly passages in the Torah not only arouse anxiety in the squeamish—they often seem to be among the most irrelevant we encounter in our sacred text. After all, the major skills of Levites and
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   (the priests), technicians of the sacred, became obsolete almost two thousand years ago when the Temple went up in flames. While Jews with the status of
   <i>
    kohanim
   </i>
   survive in our own day, their role is marginal even in traditional synagogues, and Reform Jews have virtually eliminated their special status. Yet the Torah promises that Israelites who are faithful to the covenant will become
   <i>
    mamlechet kohanim
   </i>
   —a kingdom of priests; it envisions an entire people which serves in a priestly role (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    Exodus 19:6
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   No doubt many of us would have preferred that the Torah command us to become “a kingdom of prophets,” collectively denouncing the world’s inequities, speaking out for justice and defending the downtrodden. But it is to the priesthood that we Jews are taught to aspire, and the priesthood from which we must seek instruction in
   <i>
    parashat Vayikra.
   </i>
   What can we learn from the role of the priests—and from these methodical instructions for the slaughter and dismemberment of animals for ritual offering on the altar?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   If human beings were gentle and benevolent by nature we might not need the stern, disciplinary teachings of the priesthood. The Torah’s insight is that priestly service is what our homicidal proclivities demand and deserve. So the descendants of Phinehas, a family whose origins are murderous and full of rage (see
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_25.10-18">
    Numbers 25:1–14
   </a>
   ), are taught to (re)direct their zealous energies to the service of God. They turn from uncontrolled aggression to the discipline of ritual slaughter, hedged about with myriad laws and regulations. As officiants at the altar, their killing is tamed and domesticated, their dangerous proclivities neutralized. Stripped of the normal male prerogatives of land ownership and military service, they become, as my teacher Melila Hellner-Eshed suggests, “God’s housewives”—feminized men who dress in skirts and busy themselves with the domestic work of cooking and cleaning in God’s holy dwelling.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Sublimation of aggression may, in fact, underlie
   <a id="page_590">
   </a>
   the entire sacrificial system of worship. A
   <i>
    korban,
   </i>
   an offering to God, is more than an act of violence. It is violence transmuted into something higher; it is God re-shaping a destructive human drive into productive, creative energy. Through bringing offerings to the altar, the fierce passions of the ego are not indulged but controlled and transcended. Animals, valued possessions and markers of wealth, are given selflessly to God—and thus the worshiper learns gradually to overcome narcissism and greed. Animal blood is dashed on the altar, but human blood may not be shed; substitution trains the worshipers to restrain their own innate savagery.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The opening of our parashah reads:
   <i>
    Adam ki yakriv mikem korban l’Adonai
   </i>
   —“When any of you presents an offering of cattle to
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="ltr">
    יהוה
   </span>
   ” (
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    1:2
   </a>
   ). A Hasidic commentator offers an interpretive reading: “One who wants to become
   <i>
    karov
   </i>
   —close to God—must bring an offering
   <i>
    mikem
   </i>
   —that is, from oneself.” And what is the offering? It is the beast within ourselves—the part of ourselves that is capable of cruelty and brutality, even to those we love (
   <i>
    Itturei Torah,
   </i>
   IV, 1998, p. 10). The ritual of animal sacrifice, understood symbolically, conveys the struggle of flawed human beings to become more humane.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Israelites approached the altar in order to attain closeness to the Divine—to experience what we today would call spiritual elevation, a consciousness of being lifted up to something higher than themselves. They drew nearer to God not by denying the body and its drives but by raising the physical to a sacred purpose. From the rituals of worship set forth in
   <i>
    Vayikra
   </i>
   we learn that aggression need not be extinguished in the personality in order to lead a holy life; it may instead be channeled in constructive directions and employed for the good.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   A Talmudic passage reminds us that certain traits may be inborn, but character is never determined by fate. All human energies are ours to activate as we wish, in accordance with our freedom. Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak observed: “One who is born under the sign of Mars will be a shedder of blood.” Rav Ashi did not see such a prediction as necessarily bad, for as he pointed out, one could “shed blood” for a good cause—by becoming “either a surgeon,…a ritual slaughterer
   <i>
    (shochet),
   </i>
   or a circumciser (
   <i>
    mohel
   </i>
   )” (BT
   <i>
    Shabbat
   </i>
   156a).

   we learn that through the discipline of our faith we can redeem what is broken and flawed within ourselves, transforming barbaric urges into opportunities for blessing.

   <div class="poem">
    drown them in tears, reconciling.
   </div>
   <div class="poem1">
    We forgive mostly not from strength
   </div>
   <div class="poem">
    but through imperfections, for memory
   </div>
   <div class="poem">
    wears transparent as a glass with the pattern
   </div>
   <div class="poem">
    washed off, till we stare past what injured us.
   </div>
   <div class="poem">
    We forgive because we too have done
   </div>
   <div class="poem">
    the same to others easy as a mudslide;
   </div>
   <div class="poem">
    or because anger is a fire that must be fed
   </div>
   <div class="poem">
    and we are too tired to rise and haul a log.
   </div>
  </div>
 </body>
