   (“when you go out”) contains a wide range of criminal, civil, and family laws, featuring many of the humane precepts for which Deuteronomy is justly famous. The topics addressed include relationships within households (between men, women, and children), among neighbors, between the underprivileged and other members of society, and even between humans and animals. As elsewhere, notably in the preceding parashah, Deuteronomy is concerned with the formation of an ideal Israelite society. However, whereas
   <i>
    parashat Shof’tim
   </i>
   concentrates on public officials, most of the laws in
   <i>
    Ki Teitzei
   </i>
   are directed at ordinary individuals. What may have once been considered family matters—such as the rights of a lesser loved wife, the punishment of wayward children, the finding of lost objects—here are matters of concern to the society at large that must be legislated publicly. The goal is to create a balanced society in which the poor and weak are legally protected from the rich and strong, in which both property and human lives are respected, and—most importantly—in which individuals are subject to the community and its laws.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   While some laws in this parashah seem to follow a logical or topical order, others appear to have been inserted at random. Most of the laws offer no reason or justification for adhering to them; but some refer to events recounted earlier in the Torah, such as the skin affliction of Miriam (
   <a href="#chap-fn9-5a">
    24:9
   </a>
   ). The repeated mention of God’s approval or disapproval (as in
   <a href="#chap-fn13-6">
    24:13
   </a>
   and
   <a href="#chap-fn5-2">
    22:5
   </a>
   ) reminds us that no matter how secular the laws of Deuteronomy may appear to us, the book presents them as being on behalf of—and through—the will of God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Issues pertaining to women are prominent in this parashah. They include the treatment of a captive woman, forced sex, accusations of non-virginity, divorce, and levirate marriage. Much in the ideal society that Deuteronomy envisions revolves around the status of women, generally their sexual status as wives or potential wives. Since the family unit is the basis of society, marriage and the women’s position in the family unit are important. Deuteronomy advocates chastity before marriage but, at the same time, protects women in cases where premarital sex was forced upon them; however, the penalty for promiscuous sex is severe. Most of all, Deuteronomy seeks to ensure that women marry, for ancient Israelite society offered no good place for an adult unmarried woman.

     when he wills his property to his sons, he may not treat as first-born the son of the loved one in disregard of the son of the unloved one who is older.
     <sup>

     </sup>
     Instead, he must accept the first-born, the son of the unloved one, and allot to him a double portion of all he possesses; since he is the first fruit of his vigor, the birthright is his due.

   MARRIAGE TO A PRISONER OF WAR (21:10–14)

  <div class="tab-enin">
   This section on the captive wife continues the discussion of war in the preceding parashah (
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#deu_20.1-20">
    20:1–20
   </a>
   ). If an Israelite warrior wishes to marry a female captive, he is obligated to enable the woman to transition to her new status. The seeming conflict between this law and others that prohibit marrying women from the surrounding cultures (see especially 7:2–4) highlights the fact that the Torah does not unconditionally prohibit marrying foreign women. Rather, the prohibition pertains to those specific local Canaanite nations whose practices threaten Israel’s identity and unconditional commitment to God. [The main purpose of this law is to protect the vulnerable (as is true of other laws in Deuteronomy) and to preserve the woman’s position and dignity. That men legally had sexual access to women captured in war is evident in numerous texts from the ancient world; see, for example, the comments by the women who comfort the mother of Israel’s enemy leader, Sisera, in the Song of Deborah (Judges 5:29–30).—

   The Bible characterizes several women as beautiful, including Sarah, Rebekah, and Rachel (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.10-14.24">
    Genesis 12:11
   </a>

   </a>
   ;
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#g29-17">
    29:17
   </a>
   ). Here, the woman’s beauty is the source of the attraction. (For more on this topic, see

   The captive woman enters the household, but only after she is given a month to mourn the loss of her parents can the Israelite marry her. The change in her status is signaled by trimming her hair and paring her nails (which may be signs of mourning or of the end of the mourning period), as well as by discarding her captive’s clothing.

   If the Israelite later rejects this foreign wife, he must free her outright. Her status as the wife of an Israelite forever protects her from becoming, or reverting to, the status of a foreign slave (compare
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-7">
    Exodus 21:7–8

   ).

   this inflection of the verbal root
   <i>
    e-n-h
   </i>
   can mean to debase a woman by having sex with her outside of a regularly contracted marriage. (For more on this verb, see at
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
    Genesis 34:2
   </a>
   .) This raises the possibility that the man had sex with the woman while she was still a captive, which would not have been unusual. Alternatively, this verb may indicate that the marriage, while recognized as legal, was not considered typical.

  <div class="head2" id="deu_vv.15-17">
   HEIR WHOSE MOTHER IS AN UNLOVED WIFE (21:15–17)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The law concerns a man with two wives, although he presumably could have more. Indeed, several biblical narratives point to the two-wife family (plus concubines): Rachel and Leah (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.1-30">
    Genesis 29
   </a>
   ), Hannah and Peninnah (I Samuel 1), and the lesser-known wives of Lamech, Adah and Zillah (
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#G4-22">
    Genesis 4:19
   </a>
   ). The tension here over whose son has the rights of inheritance also informs the story of Sarah and Hagar (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    Genesis 16–21
   </a>
   ). This law is not intended to protect the unloved wife, rather, to protect the legal heir. As the husband’s first-born son, the child must be designated as his heir and receive a double portion regardless of the man’s feelings about the mother. Inheritance, which involved land, is extremely important in the Bible; thus, great pains are taken to identify the proper heirs and preserve the transmission of land holdings to them (see
   <a href="#deu_25.5-10">
    25:5–10
   </a>
   ).

   The same Hebrew words describe the situation of Leah and Rachel (see at
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#g29-30">
    Genesis 29:30–31
   </a>
   ), although there the subject of inheritance does not surface in the conflict.
  </div>
  <div class="head" id="deu_vv.18-21">
   THE INCORRIGIBLE SON (21:18–21)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The law now moves to another type of child, the incorrigible son. This law probably does not apply to daughters, for the characteristics of being a glutton and a drunkard seem to be stereotypically male, whereas
   <a href="#chap-fn20-3">
    22:20–21
   </a>
   does concern a rebellious daughter (see below). The text states explicitly that both mother and father are equally involved in multiple attempts to discipline the son. If they are unable to control him, it becomes the larger society’s responsibility to deal with him. Insubordination to parents, a violation of “Honor your father and mother” (
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#chap-fn16-3">
    5:16
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-8">
    Exodus 20:12
   </a>
   ; also
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#page_704">
    Leviticus 19:3
   </a>
   ), is considered a capital offense. Such behavior undermines the parents’ authority and the function of families, which are the center of Israelite society.

   The prohibition on cross-dressing is not explained, except to note that it is abhorrent to God. This rule perhaps was intended to prevent unacceptable sexual practices or pagan cultic practices. More likely, it aims to maintain gender boundaries, analogous to the laws against forbidden mixtures in
   <a href="#chap-fn9-2">
    22:9–11

   , thus preventing confusion about the public presentation of a person’s gender identity.

   This law deals with the humane treatment of a mother bird and her fledglings. Interpreters often compare it to the prohibition of cooking a kid (baby goat) in its mother’s milk (see at

    14:21

   The list of forbidden mixtures covers plants, animals, and clothing. No reason for these prohibitions is provided. (See also at

   . This verse does not explain why tassels (
   <i>

   ) should be put on one’s everyday clothes. However,
   <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#num15-37">

   </a>
   mandates
   <i>
    tzitzit

   (there translated as “fringes”) as reminders to obey God’s commandments. The law appears to be gender neutral, in that women are not excluded from wearing tassels. (For more on tasseled garments, see at

   n the Bible, women are expected to be chaste before marriage. This unit inquires into cases in which a woman’s premarital chastity is either in doubt or known to have been violated. (For further discussion, see Tikva Frymer-Kensky, “Law and Philosophy: The Case of Sex in the Bible,” reprinted in

   FALSE AND TRUE ACCUSATIONS OF UNCHASTITY (22:13–21)

   This passage presents the case of a husband who falsely accuses his bride of having been unchaste before the marriage. Motivating this accusation is the husband’s desire to get out of the marriage without incurring any financial costs. Under normal circumstances, if a man divorces his wife he must pay the support-money required by the marriage contract. However, if his accusation of unchastity succeeds, the husband will be able to rid himself of his wife without payment; and he might even benefit financially, for he is in essence accusing the bride’s father of breach of contract. The husband claims that he contracted and gave the betrothal gift for a virgin but received a wife whose betrothal gift should have been less. If so, the contract would be declared invalid; as a result, the husband would recoup the betrothal gift he had paid and the father might have to pay additional money as damages to the husband.

   In this legal scenario, the husband makes public statements defaming the bride. Her parents sue the husband for defamation of character, of both the bride and her parents. According to this reading, the parents are the plaintiffs and the husband is the defendant. Alternatively, the husband is the plaintiff, bringing the legal claim of unchastity; and the parents are the defendants. Both mother and father bring evidence to the elders; but only the father utters the legal declaration, perhaps because the claim of breach of contract is directed at him. (Compare 21:20, where both parents make a legal declaration.)

   Typically, readers assume this to be a blood-stained sheet from the wedding night. Many commentators, medieval and modern, have noted the flimsiness of this evidence and the impossibility of proving whether the bloodstain was faked or not, even assuming that the custom of saving the wedding sheet for such an occasion was indeed practiced in ancient Israel. On the other hand, it would have been difficult to prove that the evidence was faked. If the parents bring the lawsuit, with evidence that is hard to refute, then clearly the accusation is false. This action and the penalty that the elders impose upon the man aim at deterring such false accusations. Without such deterrence, husbands might all too easily accuse their unloved wives of premarital unchastity, to the detriment of a society in which marriage and family were the keystones.

   This is double the betrothal gift (

    v. 29

   ) that the father would have returned had the accusation been true. Thus, the would-be “thief” pays double what he wishes to steal. The fine is paid to the father, not the wife, for he is considered the injured party in the lawsuit.

   The husband’s aim from the start seems to have been to divorce his wife, and this option now is forever denied him. To a modern reader, this seems to be a punishment for the bride as well as for the husband. In ancient society, however, a woman was more secure economically when married than when divorced. (An individual could scarcely survive economically or socially unless she or he was a part of a family or similar group. This was especially true of women, who had few means of independent support and little chance for social standing or power outside the group. See at
   <a href="#page_1175">
    22:29
   </a>
   .) This law was probably intended to deter false accusations of unchastity, or perhaps to deter easy and baseless divorces.

   If the accusation is true, the sentence is carried out at the entrance to the father’s house, not at the town gate; the father is held responsible and thus is publicly dishonored. The penalty for the wife is death. Premarital sex in itself is not the problem (although it was certainly discouraged; see
   <a href="#deu22-28">
    vv. 28–29
   </a>
   ); the problem here, from the husband’s view, is misrepresentation—providing the husband with a wife whose due betrothal gift would have been lower than that of the virgin that he contracted for. Many scholars think that this section was added later for the sake of symmetry; clearly, the main emphasis is on the case of false, not true, accusation.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Modem scholars have understood this case as the female parallel to the incorrigible son. In both cases, the offspring fails to uphold the family standards and goes against parental authority. In both cases, the parents’ testimony decides the outcome; and the penalty for disobeying parental authority is death by stoning. This parallel strongly suggests that in both cases, the issue is repeated, uncontrolled behavior—not a one-time occurrence. The “unchaste bride” is actually being accused of promiscuity and deception, not merely a pre-marital fling. These laws attempt to promote proper behavior by adolescent women and men who are at precisely the age when rebellion against parental authority is most likely.

   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_21.22-22.12">

   Better, “no signs of virginity belonging to the girl were found.” In other words, the parents could not or did not bring the cloth to the elders, so there was no way to disprove the husband’s accusation.

   THE PENALTY FOR ADULTERY (22:22)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In the Bible, adultery is defined as sex between a married or betrothed woman and a man other than her husband or fiancé (see also
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-13">
    Exodus 20:13
   </a>
   ). This verse is placed here to make clear that adultery is a capital offense and that both parties receive the death penalty. In the story of the adulterous encounter between King David and Bathsheba (II Samuel 11–12), God commutes David’s death sentence; Bathsheba’s guilt is not mentioned. While in that story it is David who initiates the sexual act, Proverbs 7 tells of a married woman who lures a young man into committing adultery.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="deu_vv.23-27">
   FORCED AND CONSENSUAL SEX WITH A BETROTHED WOMAN (22:23–27)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   While Deuteronomy takes a dim view of premarital sex by a woman (see below), it recognizes that in some cases women are victims of nonconsensual sex and therefore seeks to protect them from culpability in those cases. (A betrothed woman, meaning one whose marriage has been contracted, is for legal reasons considered like a married woman. If she engages in consensual sex with a man other than the one betrothed to her, both are committing adultery.) How does one determine if the sex was consensual or not? This section establishes that if the encounter took place in the town (
   <a href="#D22-23">
    vv. 23–24
   </a>
   ), where she could call for help if she needed it, then the sex is judged to be consensual and both are culpable. The supposition is that had she called for help, she would have been heard and rescued. However, in the country (
   <a href="#deu22-25">
    vv. 25–27
   </a>
   ), where presumably no help is available, the sex is assumed to have been forced and the woman is not culpable. We may assume that the woman went on to marry her fiancé with no legal repercussions.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="deu_vv.28-29">
   FORCED SEX WITH AN UNBETROTHED WOMAN (22:28–29)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This case concerns a woman who is not married or betrothed, so engaging in sex with her does not constitute adultery. The law assumes that the man initiated the act and that there was some degree of coercion, as reflected in the statement, “he seizes her and lies with her” (
   <a href="#deu22-28">
    v. 28
   </a>
   ; compare
   <a href="#D22-23">
    v. 23
   </a>
   ). The man is obligated to marry the woman and to pay the betrothal gift for virgins; he may never divorce her. (Compare
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-16">
    Exodus 22:15–16
   </a>
   , which does not include the no-divorce stipulation and provides for the father’s refusal of the marriage.)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Some modern commentators wonder if this was a form of elopement, or a way for the woman to force her father to agree to her choice of a marriage partner. Others view the law as hard on the woman, who would have to remain married to her “rapist” (although this was not necessarily a rape). As in most cases, however, the law is not focused on the interests of women individually, but instead on families and society. The law assumes some initiative or even force on the man’s part (on such language, see at
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#E19-15">
    Exodus 19:15
   </a>
   ); after all, voluntary sex on the woman’s part that did not result in marriage to the sexual partner would leave her vulnerable to the true claim of unchastity by a subsequent husband (see
   <a href="#chap-fn20-3">
    vv. 20–21
   </a>
   ). This law seeks to prevent that situation. Sex by an unmarried or unbetrothed woman is, as it were, covered up by making it sound less-than-consensual and by quickly marrying off the woman to her sexual partner (who would hardly be in a position to later accuse her of unchastity). The man is obligated to remain married to her for much the same reason as the false accuser is (see at
   <a href="#deu20-19">
    v. 19
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Permanent marriage without the possibility of divorce protects the woman (see at
   <a href="#deu20-19">
    v. 19
   </a>
   ), who would find it difficult to contract another marriage if her past marital or sexual history were known. The law also protects the father’s interest in that he receives the fullest betrothal gift. A never-married non-virgin daughter would not be easy to marry off. Given that there must have been women of this description, Deuteronomy is at pains to protect them while still adhering to a high ideal standard for women’s premarital sexual behavior.

   These verses exclude Ammonites and Moabites because they treated Israel poorly after the Exodus. According to
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#g19-36">
    Genesis 19:36–38
   </a>
   , Ammon and Moab are the offspring of the incestuous unions between Lot and his daughters, which may explain why they are included just after the mention of the
   <i>
    mamzer.
   </i>
   Traditional commentators interpret this exclusion as applying only to male Ammonites and Moabites. This helps eliminate the contradiction between this verse and the book of Ruth, in which a Moabite woman (Ruth) is accepted into the Israelite community. The present translation understands the grammatically masculine language in this prohibition to refer to women as well, based on an allusion in I Kings 11:1–2 (
   <i>
    The Torah: A Modern Commentary,
   </i>
   revised edition, 2005, p. 1328). However the exclusion of Ammonites and Moabites is defined, its historical origin is not known, nor is it clear if Deuteronomy’s denial of citizenship also included a ban on marrying them (although that may have been the result).

   Ritual purity is required in the military camp, for God is thought to be present in it. Certain bodily functions render a man impure (see at

   Heb.
   <i>

   </i>
   and
   <i>
    kadeish.
   </i>
   In the past, scholars understood these terms as a reference to male and female cult prostitution, which was associated with Canaanite and Mesopotamian fertility rites where ritual sexual union was believed to ensure agricultural fertility. The reason for this interpretation is that the term
   <i>
    k’deishah
   </i>
   derives from
   <i>
    k-d-sh
   </i>
   (meaning “holy” or “set apart”) and the etymologically related Akkadian term
   <i>
    kadishtu
   </i>
   refers to a type of priestess. Recent scholarship, however, has questioned the existence of cult prostitution in the ancient Near East, although there may have been prostitutes in the vicinity of temples, and temples may have received funds from their activities. Many scholars now believe that
   <i>
    k’deishah
   </i>
   means a common prostitute (
   <i>
    zonah
   </i>
   ), not a cult prostitute (see
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#G38-12">
    Genesis 38:15
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#g38-21">
    21
   </a>
   , where both terms are used). [Others suggest different interpretations. Tikva Frymer-Kensky writes that
   <i>
    k’deishah
   </i>
   refers to “a public woman, who might be found along the roadway (as virgins or married women should not be). She could engage in sex, but might also be sought out for lactation, midwifery, and other female concerns” (
   <i>
    Women In Scripture,
   </i>
   2000, p. 162). Phyllis A. Bird, who translates
   <i>
    k’deishah
   </i>
   as “hierodule” (from Greek, meaning “a sacred/holy servant”) considers the term to refer to a variety of cult-related women (
   <i>
    Missing Persons and Mistaken Identities,
   </i>
   1997, p. 199).—

  <div class="tab-enin">
   While the Bible certainly does not encourage prostitution, it acknowledges and accepts it as part of the social reality. Indeed, since prostitutes are among the socially inferior in that they do not belong to male-headed households, the Bible occasionally treats them with sympathy (see the depiction of Rahab in Joshua 2 and the two women who plead before Solomon in I Kings 3:16–27). Deuteronomy’s strong stance against prostitution fits with the book’s idealized picture of society.

   This law about forbidden remarriage considers it indecent (akin to adultery) for a husband to remarry a woman he divorced who subsequently married another man. This may have been intended to deter quick divorce or to prevent promiscuity; concerns about paternity could also be an issue. Note that David’s wife Michal was given to another man, Paltiel, by her father King Saul, but David subsequently demanded her back as his wife (I Samuel 18:27; 25:44; II Samuel 3:13–16). (See also at

   This technical language for divorce—the opposite of “takes her as a wife”— means that the woman is no longer part of the man’s household. [This ruling was not always interpreted to mean that only husbands could initiate divorce. The oldest surviving Jewish marriage contracts (from a Jewish community in Elephantine, Egypt) show that in the 5th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.

   , wives could initiate a divorce.—

   LEVIRATE MARRIAGE (25:5–10)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Levirate marriage is intended to secure the continuation of a deceased married man’s lineage and land-inheritance if he has no children. This principle is operative in the story of Judah and Tamar (
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
    Genesis 38
   </a>
   ) and hinted at, although not in its normal form, in the book of Ruth. Deuteronomy provides a process for opting out of the levirate marriage, later called
   <i>
    chalitzah,
   </i>
   although in biblical times it seems that levirate marriage was preferred. The number of such marriages must have been relatively small, since most married couples would have produced a child within a few years of marriage, before the husband died. Military deferment for new husbands (
   <a href="#chap-fn5-5a">
    24:5
   </a>
   ) helps to avoid the situation whereby a man is killed in war before he has sired a child.

   The widow initiates the public proceedings after her brother-in-law denies her the protection and status that she would have as a wife and mother, and as the beneficiary of her husband’s inheritance. The woman here clearly has legal standing and is entitled to bring a case to the court. Her words and actions, formalized by the law, are a performative way of publicly shaming the brother-in-law who refuses the levirate marriage.

   The law does not envision a woman being able or desiring to reject a levirate marriage. After all, to become an unattached childless widow is a position most ancient women would have wished to avoid.

    Exodus 17:8–16

   . Amalek is singled out for strong condemnation. The command to blot out the name of this enemy is emphasized by its being framed by “remember…do not forget.” (There is an irony to the command to remember to blot out Amalek’s name.) In synagogues, this passage is traditionally read aloud from the Torah on Shabbat Zachor, the sabbath before Purim. By calling Haman an Agagite, the book of Esther makes him an Amalekite, whose king in the time of Saul was Agag. Amalek became a symbol of later Jewish enemies as well.

    HE LEGISLATION IN
   </small>
   <a href="#deu24-1">
    24:1–4
   </a>
   deals not with divorce so much as with remarriage. The text mentions only in passing that grounds for divorce include
   <i>
    ervat davar,
   </i>
   translated here as “something obnoxious” in a woman (
   <a href="#deu24-1">
    v. 1
   </a>
   ), and that a
   <i>
    sefer k’ritut,
   </i>
   a “bill of divorcement,” changes hands (
   <a href="#deu24-1">
    v. 3
   </a>
   ). The real concern of this section is to prohibit a man from
   <i>
    remarrying
   </i>
   a woman who had taken a new husband in the meantime, even if the subsequent marriage ended legitimately.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   It remains unclear what, if anything, these verses signify about contractual relations between husbands and wives in ancient Israel; but what lessons can we draw from the text itself? Some commentators claim that this legislation is meant to guard against confusion over paternity; others posit that it discourages men from divorcing in haste and repenting at leisure. Yet these ends could be achieved without a new-husband clause, so why not simply prohibit remarriage to the same wife? One possible answer is that the new-husband clause might create a measure of autonomy for the woman, who is otherwise a passive party under biblical marriage law. She can put herself off limits to her first husband by agreeing to become another man’s spouse, or she can signal her commitment to her first husband by remaining single.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   But why would the male authors of this text legislate for female autonomy? Perhaps because of the intriguing theological implications as set forth in the book of Jeremiah. Along with some other prophets, Jeremiah envisages a metaphorical marriage in which God is the husband and Israel the wife who has done “something obnoxious” or “unseemly” (
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#chap-fn8-5">
    3:8
   </a>
   ). Israel has been unfaithful with many lovers (
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#chap-fn01head">
    3:1
   </a>
   ), meaning that she has worshipped other gods. The prophet implies that even if God hands Israel a bill of divorce, she can refrain from taking a new husband (by no longer worshipping other gods) and can instead wait for her first husband, God, to take her back.

   ) that the Torah is making a concession to the
   <i>
    yetzer hara

   <a id="page_1186">
   </a>
   One restriction involves requiring the consent of both parents to the punishment. The son cannot be subjected to the procedure unless he has both a father and a mother, and the parents’ marriage must be a “suitable” one. If either parent has any one of a number of physical defects, the law does not apply (

   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_19.18">

   (
   <a href="#deu24-1">
    24:1
   </a>
   ). This passage (
   <a href="#deu24-1">
    vv. 1–4
   </a>
   ) takes for granted a husband’s right to initiate divorce. Citing this verse, some of the Rabbis allow a man to divorce his wife simply because he finds her housekeeping skills unsatisfactory or because he no longer finds her physically attractive (Mishnah
   <i>
    Gittin
   </i>
   9:10).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Torah does not mention a wife’s right to initiate divorce, but Jews have nevertheless recognized it in various times and place (compare
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-7">
    Exodus 21:10–11
   </a>
   ). Extant Jewish marriage contracts from the early Second Temple period stipulate either party’s right to initiate divorce. Marriage contracts among rabbinic Jews of the early medieval Levant often contain similar stipulations.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Meanwhile, the Mishnah (
   <i>
    K’tubot
   </i>
   5:7) mentions a different approach, wherein an unhappy wife can start a countdown for dissolution of the marriage by declaring herself to be a
   <i>
    moredet
   </i>
   (refusing or recalcitrant wife). After allowing time for reconciliation, the court would apparently compel her husband to divorce her, although she would not receive a divorcée’s usual marriage settlement.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The Mishnah allows women to petition the court directly for release from an unsatisfactory marriage (
   <i>
    K’tubot
   </i>
   7:10), and it describes instances in which a man’s behavior would require that he divorce his wife (
   <i>
    K’tubot
   </i>
   7:1–5). Yet according to another line of legal reasoning, a man cannot be divorced against his will (Mishnah
   <i>
    Gittin
   </i>
   9:8; BT
   <i>
    Gittin
   </i>
   88b). In Babylonia, most rabbinic authorities maintained that only a husband could initiate divorce, and this view prevailed in rabbinic Judaism by approximately the year 1300

   (

   for speaking against him (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-10">
    Numbers 12:10–15

   ). Rashi here echoes the words of
   <i>
    Sifrei D’varim,
   </i>
   “If you want to avoid being stricken with
   <i>
    tzaraat,
   </i>
   do not gossip, for Miriam gossiped about her brother and was stricken.” The 13th-century commentator Nachmanides adds here that this exhortation should be understood as a positive commandment parallel to other verses that call on us to remember something in particular (such as
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-8">
    Exodus 20:8
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_25.17-19">
    Deuteronomy 25:17
   </a>
   ). He notes that the gravity of this commandment is demonstrated by the affliction of Miriam, “a righteous woman, a prophet who spoke about her brother out of concern, loving him as she did herself.” Although Miriam “did not speak directly to Moses so as not to embarrass him, nor did she speak in public, but only in private to her holy brother [Aaron],” nonetheless, and despite “all of her good deeds,” she was punished. This demonstrates the enormity of gossip.

   <a id="page_1187">
   </a>
   is required (for example,
   <i>
    Y’vamot
   </i>
   1:1–3; 2:1–3). The Talmud recounts situations in which widows were reluctant to marry their brothers-in-law despite the men’s eagerness to perform levirate marriage. These women confided their concerns to rabbis, who—convinced that the men’s motives were selfish—tricked the men into releasing their sisters-in-law from their obligations (BT
   <i>
    Y’vamot

   106a).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Beginning already in the Talmud (BT
   <i>

    HE CENTRALITY OF MEMORY
   </small>
   to Jewish self-understanding emerges with great vividness in
   <i>
    parashat Ki Teitzei
   </i>
   , which repeatedly enjoins us to remember events in ways that affect ongoing behavior and practice: “Always
   <i>
    remember
   </i>
   that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore…observe this commandment” (
   <a href="#deu24-18">
    24:18
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#deu24-22">
    22
   </a>
   ). “In cases of a skin affection be most careful to do exactly as the levitical priests instruct you….
   <i>
    Remember
   </i>
   what your God
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   did to Miriam on the journey after you left Egypt” (
   <a href="#chap-fn8-5a">
    24:8–9
   </a>
   ).
   <i>
    “Remember
   </i>
   what Amalek did to you on your journey, after you left Egypt…you shall blot out the memory of Amalek” (
   <a href="#deu_25.17-19">
    25:17
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#deu_25.17-19">
    19
   </a>
   ). Clearly, the major events of the Jewish past are not simply history but living, active memory that continues to shape Jewish identity in the present. Through telling the story of our past, we learn who we are and must become.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In insisting on the significance of memory for identity, the parashah shows that memory can serve a wide variety of purposes and can be used to support modes of being that seem to conflict with each other. The memory of enslavement in Egypt is repeatedly yoked with injunctions insisting upon justice and compassion: “You shall not subvert the rights of the stranger or the fatherless; you shall not take a widow’s garment in pawn” (
   <a href="#deu24-17">
    24:17
   </a>
   ). "When you reap the harvest in your field and overlook a sheaf in the field, do not turn back to get it; it shall go to the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow” (
   <a href="#chap-fn19-6">
    24:19
   </a>
   ). Because Jews once knew hunger and experienced what it was like to dwell as strangers on the margins of society, we are commanded to create a society in which the marginal are cared for and the hungry are provided with food.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Memories of the deeds of the Ammonites and Moabites and the perfidy of Amalek become the foundation for opposite injunctions, those concerning exclusion and vengeance. Because the Ammonites and Moabites did not provide Israel with food in the wilderness, the descendants of these nations should be excluded from God’s congregation, even to the tenth generation (
   <a href="#chap-fn3-4">
    23:3–4
   </a>
   ). Because Amalek cut down stragglers in the line of march when Israel left Egypt hungry and tired, the memory of the Amalekites should be entirely obliterated (
   <a href="#deu_25.17-19">
    25:17–19
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The memory of Miriam’s skin condition
   <i>
    (tzaraat)
   </i>
   is still another kind of memory, a highly truncated one. Already in the book of Exodus when Miriam is introduced, it seems clear that she is not being remembered fully. She appears suddenly, leading the women in song at a central moment of the people Israel’s history (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:20–21
   </a>
   ) as if she materialized
   <a id="page_1188">
   </a>
   out of the desert sands. Later, her death and burial are recorded in one verse (
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_20.1-29">
    Numbers 20:1
   </a>
   ). There is no account of her passing or of the community’s response; she vanishes, disappearing, as it were, into the desert sands. In this parashah, her
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   is remembered (
   <a href="#chap-fn8-5a">
    24:8–9
   </a>
   ), but not her leadership; her punishment is recalled, but not the challenge to Moses’ authority that she mounts with Aaron (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
    Numbers 12:1–2
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   If memory is foundational to Jewish community, then perhaps this one-sided memory of a very important woman in the Torah is part of what creates the preconditions for some of the sexual legislation in the parashah. It makes sense that a community that cannot remember its central female figures in all their roundedness will also have difficulty imagining women as agents of their own sexuality—and thus will repeatedly subordinate their interests to those of fathers and husbands. We read that if a woman is found not to be a virgin when she marries, she is stoned to death on her father’s doorstep (
   <a href="#deu_22.13-29">
    22:13–21
   </a>
   ); that a virgin who is raped is then forced to marry her rapist (

   <a href="#deu24-1">
    24:1–4
   </a>
   ); and that a woman who is widowed before she has children must marry her husband’s brother (
   <a href="#deu_25.5-10">
    25:5–10
   </a>
   ). The Torah in this section offers no store of memories of women’s perspectives and experiences that could provide the basis for an alternative ethic.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   What do we do, then, when the demands of memory seem to be at odds with each other—when, for example, the partial and distorted memory of Miriam in this parashah collides with the notion of remembering the marginalized, including the marginalized within the Israelite community?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The process of remembering brings with it an obligation to ethical discernment: which memories do we want to affirm and further develop and which do we want to repudiate or transform? We cannot forget the commandments to exclude the Ammonites or blot out the memory of Amalek because their presence in the Torah reminds us of how easy it is to respond to vengeance with more vengeance, or injustice with more injustice. But we can also consciously cultivate memories that encourage us to stop the cycle of violence and domination. When we remember the courage and initiative of Miriam in helping to save her brother (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.1-22">
    Exodus 2:1–10
   </a>
   ), when we appreciate her importance to the Israelites who refused to move on without her (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-10">
    Numbers 12:15
   </a>
   ), when we honor her insistence that her own leadership be recognized (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-2">
    Numbers 12:2
   </a>
   ), then we lay the foundations for contemporary communities in which women and other “strangers” can take their full and rightful place.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   Perhaps the process of sifting through memory also can help to make sense of the last, enigmatic verse of the parashah that enjoins us to “blot out” all memory of Amalek and yet “remember” at the same time. How is this possible? Having grown up in a Reform congregation in the 1950s in which women were on the
   <i>
    bimah
   </i>
   only to light candles, I am aware of how the enormous changes in women’s roles over the last half century make such memories of prior injustices difficult to believe. We blot out the memory of Amalek when we create Jewish communities in which the perpetual exclusion of some group of people—or the denial of women’s rights—are so contrary to current values as to be almost incredible. Yet, if we are to safeguard our achievements, we can also never forget to remember the history of inequality and the decisions and struggles that have made more equitable communities possible.
