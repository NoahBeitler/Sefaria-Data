   (“law [that]”) acknowledges the grim reality of death in the wilderness, a necessary succession in leadership, and the approach of the journey’s end. Repeatedly in this parashah, healing and new life follow death. In the face of the chaos and unpredictability of death and its contaminating powers,
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_19.1-22">
    Numbers 19
   </a>
   responds with a priestly ritual, recording instructions that contain a great deal of regulatory detail, delivered in an orderly, precise tone.
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_20.1-29">
    Numbers 20
   </a>
   focuses on two significant deaths in the community of Israel, that of Miriam and her brother Aaron.
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_21.1-22.1a">
    Numbers 21
   </a>
   focuses on new opportunities in spite of deep disappointment, as successful battles mark a positive change in Israel’s fortune. After the loss of his siblings, Moses remains, leading Israel ever closer to the edges of the Promised Land, a land that he himself will never enter.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   The deaths of Miriam and Aaron are central to this parashah, providing us an opportunity to consider the role of each within the Israelite camp. Gender politics can be detected in the more elaborate details concerning the punishment and death of Aaron in comparison to the report of Miriam’s death. Nevertheless, the mere fact that the time and place of Miriam’s death are recorded is highly unusual and therefore quite striking. One intriguing detail even places her on a par with Moses: he too is condemned to death in the same literary unit in which Miriam and Aaron die. Could it be mere coincidence that these three siblings are grouped together in this fashion? Indeed, the prophet Micah places Miriam on a par with her brothers: “I brought you up from the land of Egypt, redeemed you from the house of bondage, and sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you” (Micah 6:4). Miriam’s death provides an opportunity to reflect on her life and to appreciate the unique features of this biblical leader (see at

   ).

   The preparations of the “water of lustration” begin with a series of steps performed by Eleazar, Aaron’s son. The officiant takes the red cow outside the camp, slaughters it, and then purifies those involved. The entire procedure is considered highly impure (

   Priestly texts are vigilant concerning boundaries. This unit deals repeatedly with such delineations: outside and inside the camp, as well as inside a tent, and out in an open field.

   In this case, the priest sprinkles the blood at the front of the Tent of Meeting. At other times, the priest sprinkles blood directly on the altar. Jacob Milgrom draws an analogy between sacrificial blood and a cleansing agent such as detergent (
   <i>
    Numbers
   </i>
   , 1990, p. 439; see also at

  <div class="tab-enin">
   Stephen Geller offers a trenchant summation of blood’s use both as a sign of sinfulness and its opposite—an agent of creative purification (“Blood Cult,” 1992, pp. 97–124). As he points out, blood signals loss of life, including murder; for instance, the blood of Abel testifies that Cain murdered him (
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#ge4-10">
    Genesis 4:10
   </a>
   ). But blood also symbolizes life itself; therefore, according to the Bible, God has forbidden humans to eat flesh without first draining its blood (
   <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#g9-1">
    Genesis 9:4–6
   </a>
   ). Blood saves Israel from death in
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e12-13">
    Exodus 12:13
   </a>
   . Paradoxically, in
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    Leviticus 12
   </a>
   , after the woman gives birth she remains in a state of “blood purification” that marks the arrival of new life; but in
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">
    Leviticus 15
   </a>
   , blood of the menstruating woman represents the missed opportunity of conception. Both conditions make a woman temporarily impure.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   These symbolic dimensions of blood are captured in the ritual of the red cow. An actual encounter with death requires that one be washed with a watery mixture containing the ashes of incinerated blood. The mixture is acquired through an animal’s death in a ceremony of purifying renewal that allows one to return to the community of the living.

   Every part of the animal is to be used. While the present ritual is unusual in adding the blood of the sacrifice to the mixture, in other respects it follows priestly precedent (as in
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_4.1-5.26">
    Leviticus 4:12

   ).

   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e36-8">
    Exodus 36:8

   ,

   [Both here and in the next verse, the probable reference is to a (male) priest or Levite; on the other hand, these may have been the kinds of tasks in which an Israelite sanctuary’s female staff could be expected to take part, if there were indeed such workers.

   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e38-8">

    </b>
   </i>
   The term for lustration,
   <i>
    niddah,
   </i>
   illustrates the way in which a word may take on contradictory meanings in different biblical traditions. Later commentary has conflated those meanings and woefully misunderstood them.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The noun
   <i>
    niddah
   </i>
   derives from the root
   <i>
    n-d-d
   </i>
   “to depart, flee, wander”; the causative use of the root means “to chase away, put aside,” related to the Akkadian cognate, “to throw, cast down.” Jacob Milgrom understands
   <i>
    niddah
   </i>
   as having originally referred to the menstrual blood, which was discharged or eliminated.
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   came to refer to the menstruant herself, “for she too was ‘discharged’ and ‘excluded’ from her society not by being kept at arm’s length from others but, in many communities, by being banished to and quarantined in separate quarters”
   <i>
    (Leviticus 1–16,
   </i>
   1991, p. 745).
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   occurs 29 times in the
   <i>
    Tanach,
   </i>
   conveying at least three possible meanings: menstrual impurity (the most frequent meaning), indecency, and purification (the present case).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    Niddah
   </i>
   is used in
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    Leviticus 12
   </a>
   and
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">
    15
   </a>
   matter-of-factly, in the midst of details concerning states of impurity for males as well as females, to designate the flow of blood during menstruation. It does not convey a negative attitude toward a menstruating woman. In
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#L20-18">
    Leviticus 20:21
   </a>
   , however, the term takes on a more negative meaning as “indecency” when used in reference to when a man marries his brother’s wife. Milgrom captures the distinction between these texts, explaining that in
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#levi_12.1-8">
    Leviticus 12
   </a>
   and
   <a href="31_chapter_28.xhtml#levi_15.1-33">
    15
   </a>
   “the word
   <i>
    niddah
   </i>
   is a technical term for menstrual discharge”; yet in
   <a href="33_chapter_30.xhtml#levi_20.1-8">
    Leviticus 20
   </a>
   and derivative literature, “it becomes a metaphor for impurity, indecency or disgrace that stems from moral rather than physical causes” (
   <i>
    Leviticus 1–16,
   </i>
   p. 744).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   A prime example of the derivative literature is Ezekiel 36:17, where the prophet uses the term in an explicitly degrading sense, comparing Israel’s defilement of the land to a menstruating woman. Reading the continuation of this passage, Jonathan Klawans suggests that the menstruating woman in Ezekiel is an apt image since she “can cleanse herself quickly and easily from her ritual impurity, so too will God purify the people from the defiling force of their sins” (
   <i>
    Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism,
   </i>
   2000, p. 31). However, one can read it in a more blatantly pejorative way, and legitimately conclude that Ezekiel resorts to the image in order to impugn Israel severely (see also Ezekiel 7:19; 18:6; 22:10).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Similarly, Ezra 9:11 borrows the analogy of the menstruating woman to emphasize that the land had been defiled by its inhabitants’ abominations. In II Chronicles 29:5,
   <i>
    niddah
   </i>
   is used in contradistinction to holiness. Nevertheless, none of these increasingly negative uses of
   <i>
    niddah
   </i>
   explains its use in
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_19.1-22">
    Numbers 19
   </a>
   .
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In the present verse,
   <i>
    niddah
   </i>
   conveys the nuance found in the term’s original meaning—being set apart—since the watery mixture is to remain
   <i>
    outside
   </i>
   the camp. Yet through purification it restores the individual to her or his proper place
   <i>
    within
   </i>
   the camp. Zechariah 13:1 highlights that sense of restoration. The prophet envisions the day on which God will vindicate Jerusalem: “On that day a fountain opened to the…inhabitants of Jerusalem for cleansing [
   <i>
    chatat
   </i>
   ] and for sprinkling [
   <i>
    niddah
   </i>
   ].” Thus, both that oracle and the present verse use
   <i>
    niddah
   </i>
   in close connection to
   <i>
    chatat.
   </i>
   In both texts
   <i>
    niddah
   </i>
   is understood not as defiling or abhorrent, but as its opposite, ensuring purification. Both passages suggest a moment of restoration and joyous relief.

   <a href="#num19-14">
    v. 14
   </a>
   states that whoever enters a tent in which someone has died faces contamination. Surely a woman runs the same risk of encountering the dead as a man. Yet, as in many other ritual procedures, the woman goes unmentioned. Given the inclusive use of the masculine pronoun elsewhere in priestly writings, one can conclude that these laws apply to women as well.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   A contaminated individual who fails to purify herself or himself remains impure and will defile the Tabernacle. To discourage such an outcome, the negligent individual is threatened with one of the most severe penalties possible in ancient Israelite law:
   <i>
    kareit
   </i>
   or excommunication. The prominence and intermingling of the words for purity (twice) and impurity (four times) along with purification (three times) urgently draw attention to maintaining the Tabernacle in its required state of purity—so that God remains in the midst of Israel.

   In this procedure of purification, “living water” (as in

    Genesis 26:19

   ) is added to the ashes, mixed together, and sprinkled on the contaminated tent, vessels, and person.

   he ritual of purification is immediately relevant since Miriam now dies. Perhaps as a result of her death, Moses and Aaron behave at Meribah in such a way as to be denied entry into the Promised Land. Aaron dies at the end of the unit, so the deaths of Moses’ siblings bracket a unit that also recounts unsuccessful negotiations with the King of Edom.

   Death reports in the Bible are highly political. Here, the politics of gender appear to play a role in the greater length and quantity of details reported of Aaron’s death versus that of his sister, Miriam. Through the shaping of their deaths in
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_20.1-29">
    Numbers 20
   </a>
   , the biblical writer reinforces and strengthens the status of Aaron at the expense of his sister. However, we readers are free to revise that opinion.

   MIRIAM’S DEATH (20:1)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In one brief verse—astonishing in its terseness—we learn of the death of Miriam.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Miriam remains an enigmatic figure. Unlike the majority of other women in the
   <i>
    Tanach
   </i>
   (the Hebrew Bible), her reputation does not rest on being someone’s mother or wife. She has an independent existence. The
   <i>
    Tanach
   </i>
   even accords her the title of “prophet” (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:20
   </a>
   ). That she is mentioned as late as the book of Chronicles testifies to “the tenacity of her place in Israel’s memory” (Rita J. Burns,
   <i>
    Has the Lord Indeed Spoken Only Through Moses?,
   </i>
   1987, pp. 92, 129). Rita Burns suggests that Miriam’s name derives from the Egyptian
   <i>
    mry,
   </i>
   meaning “beloved” (Burns, p. 10).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In spite of tantalizing hints like these, we see her fleetingly in powerful and contradictory images: joyously leading the women in song at God’s deliverance of Israel from the Sea (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.1-21">
    Exodus 15
   </a>
   ), or punished by God with “snow-white
   <i>
    tzaraat
   </i>
   ” after challenging Moses’ exclusive leadership (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
    Numbers 12
   </a>
   ). These fragmented views of Miriam suggest a more elaborate tradition that has not been preserved. Perhaps she held such an established reputation as a leader of Israel that she threatened the interests represented by the Torah’s later editors, and therefore
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num12-1">
    Numbers 12
   </a>
   extinguishes her voice. Unlike Moses and Aaron, Miriam has no successor.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Nonetheless, the details of Miriam’s death in this verse—the first new moon, the place of her burial, especially the notice that she is buried—suggest that she is a leader of significant import in the Torah. After all, the death of most characters in the Bible receives no notice. This is true especially of women; elsewhere the Torah records the deaths only of Sarah (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_23.1-20">
    Genesis 23:2
   </a>
   ), Rachel (
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num35-19">
    35:19
   </a>
   ), and Rebekah’s nurse, Deborah (
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num35-8">
    35:8
   </a>
   ). In addition, Miriam’s death is to be followed by that of her brothers, which cannot be coincidence. The three die, each in turn, on the last three stops of the journey.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In her extensive study of Miriam, Burns draws the following conclusion: “Six of the seven…texts which mention her represent her as a leader. In her initial [named] appearance in the narratives (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:20–21
   </a>
   ), Miriam officiates at a celebration of the foundational event of Hebrew religion…. In designating Miriam as ‘sister’ of Aaron (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:20
   </a>
   ) and of Aaron and Moses (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#NN26-59">
    Numbers 26:59
   </a>
   ; I Chronicles 5:29) the biblical writers use kinship terminology to express Miriam’s parallel status in religious leadership vis-à-vis that of the two other leading figures in the wilderness…. Micah 6:4…[says] that Miriam (along with Moses and Aaron) was divinely commissioned as a leader in the wilderness” (Burns, p. 121).

   MOSES AND AARON PUNISHED: FATEFUL INCIDENT AT MERIBAH (20:2–13)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Following closely on the heels of Miriam’s death, God now informs Aaron and Moses of their impending deaths. In contrast to Miriam’s death, the deaths of the brothers are explicitly considered a punishment.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Verses 1 and 2 mention “the Israelites,” “the people,” and a verbal form of “joined” which also appears in the unit as “community.” The interweaving of these terms focuses on Israel as a collective in all its manifestations. Everyone is implicated in the events of the journey; we learn that even the fates of Moses and Aaron connect irretrievably to that of Israel.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Is the timing of the present complaint for water significant? Miriam is closely associated with water: she observes the deliverance of Moses from drowning in the Nile (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_2.1-22">
    Exodus 2:1–9
   </a>
   ), and she celebrates with him at the sea (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:20–21
   </a>
   ). Right before she dies, new ritual instructions require “water of lustration” that is made from “living water” (
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_19.1-22">
    Numbers 19
   </a>
   ). And now, immediately after Miriam’s death, the people desperately cry for water. Because the two episodes follow each other sequentially, the Rabbis explicitly connect Miriam’s death to the lack of water. The linkage suggested to the midrashic imagination that she was the source of the water now gone.

   Israel’s complaint resembles that of

    Numbers 14

   , in which the people bitterly complain about leaving Egypt only to die in the wilderness (see also
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#e16-1">
    Exodus 16:3
   </a>
   ). Denied entry to Canaan due to their lack of belief in God’s power to ensure its conquest, they now pine after the food of that promised land: grain, figs, vines, and pomegranates.

   These verses describe God’s punishment of Moses and Aaron. What wrong could Moses and Aaron have committed severe enough to warrant God’s punishment after years of loyal service? The laconic quality of the narrative has provoked thousands of years of interpretation in an attempt to identify their misdeed. [Because Moses’ and Aaron’s “crime” here is not self-evident, contemporary scholars, like early rabbinic interpreters, have offered a wide range of possible explanations in addition to the one proposed here. Some suggest that the “crime” concerns striking the rock: Moses struck the rock instead of speaking to it, or perhaps he violated God’s instructions by striking it twice instead of once. Others suggest that God is angry because the incident discloses problematic aspects of Moses’ character as a leader: Moses lost his temper in an inappropriate manner. Still others suggest that Moses’ language was wrong: By phrasing his words as a question (
   <a href="#num20-10">
    v. 10
   </a>
   ), he could have been misunderstood as doubting God; by saying “shall we get water for you” (
   <a href="#num20-10">
    v. 10
   </a>
   ), he positioned himself and Aaron—instead of God—as the chief actors; or by calling the people “rebels” he denigrated them. —

   The emphasis on sight—as in

   Literally, “all its daughters.” The
   <i>
    Tanach
   </i>
   uses terms of female relations to describe a walled city as a “mother” and an open village as a “daughter.” The “mother” city (since walled) is better protected than her daughter from attack. As F. S. Frick observes, these female terms reflect and reinforce a pattern of domestic relations as well as societal conceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of a female at different points in her life: “Mothers had considerable authority over their daughters—hence the analogy of a walled mother-city exerting control of the unwalled. Just as a mother had major responsibilities in caring for her children, so the city provided protection for its people…. The fundamental awareness of maternal care permeates the concept of cities as female” (“Mother/Daughter as Territory,” in

    IRIAM, WHO HAS PLAYED
   </small>
   both a vital and a subdued role in the story of the Exodus and the wilderness wanderings, dies in this parashah. Her death is reported briefly: “Miriam died there, and was buried there” (
   <a href="#num_20.1-29">
    20:1
   </a>
   ). There is no mention of people mourning her death or feeling the loss of her contribution to the Israelite people. Not long afterward, when Aaron is about to die, Moses in an elaborate ceremony publicly passes on Aaron’s ritual clothing, signs of his exalted position, to Aaron’s son Eleazar. Then, the people mourn him for thirty days (
   <a href="#num20-22-29">
    20:22–29
   </a>
   ). This contrast between Miriam’s and Aaron’s deaths is striking and troubling.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   How does Moses respond to Miriam’s death? While the text does not record his reaction, we can glean important insights from the way he handles (or mishandles) the subsequent crisis over water and from the way her name appears obliquely in this episode.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In the debacle that immediately follows Miriam’s death, when the Israelites clamor for water (
   <a href="#num_20.1-29">
    20:2–5
   </a>
   ), Moses hits the rock instead of speaking to it as instructed (
   <a href="#num20-8">
    v. 8
   </a>
   ). God punishes both Moses and Aaron for this failure by having them die in the wilderness instead of permitting them to enter the Promised Land. The telling clue to Moses’ attitude is suggested by his words. Before hitting the rock, Moses cries out “Listen, you rebels!” (
   <a href="#num20-10">
    v. 10
   </a>
   ). The word for “rebels” is
   <i>
    morim,
   </i>
   and it appears nowhere else in the Bible in this form. Remarkably, in their unvocalized form the words,
   <i>
    morim
   </i>
   (rebels) and
   <i>
    miryam
   </i>
   (Miriam) are identical; both words are made up of the same four Hebrew consonants:
   <i>
    m-r-y-m.
   </i>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This verbal coincidence may intimate that Moses’ behavior has as much to do with losing Miriam as with his frustration with the Israelite people. It suggests that when faced with the task of producing water, Moses recalls Miriam as his older sister, his co-leader, and perhaps most of all, the clever caretaker who guarded him at the Nile.

     Miriam died
    </b>
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#num_20.1-29">
    20:1
   </a>
   ). Midrash
   <i>
    Kohelet Rabbah
   </i>
   7.4, uses this occasion to reflect upon the lives of righteous people in general, noting that when the righteous are born nobody feels the difference, but when they die, many are affected. Following Miriam’s death, for example, her well—which had provided water for the Israelites in the wilderness—ceased to exist, and everybody felt her loss (also Tosefta
   <i>
    Sotah
   </i>
   11:10). The Bible does not mention the marvel known as Miriam’s Well. However, the earliest forms of rabbinic literature discuss how the death of each of the three leaders in the wilderness resulted in the end of a beneficial supernatural phenomenon that had assisted the Children of Israel. The supernatural qualities of Miriam’s Well include that it traveled with the nation in the wilderness
   <a id="page_932">
   </a>
   (BT
   <i>
    Shabbat
   </i>
   35a) and that it later had healing powers (Midrash
   <i>
    Vayikra Rabbah
   </i>
   22.4). The medieval commentator Rashi explains the connection between Miriam’s death and the disappearance of the well (on BT
   <i>
    Shabbat
   </i>
   35a) by pointing out that the subsequent verse states, “The community was without water” (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_20.1-14">
    20:2
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    <b>
     Miriam died
    </b>
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#num_20.1-29">
    20:1
   </a>
   ). The Talmud (
   <i>
    Mo’ed Katan
   </i>
   28a) asks, “Why is the death of Miriam juxtaposed to the portion of the
   <i>
    parah adumah
   </i>
   (the red heifer of
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_19.1-22">
    Numbers 19
   </a>
   )?” It then provides the answer that the ritual of the
   <i>
    parah adumah,
   </i>
   which according to the Rabbis was performed until the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem (70
   <small>
    C.E
   </small>
   .), was intended to provide atonement for specific types of sin. Therefore, the Talmud explains, the deaths of righteous people, including Miriam, have an atoning effect. This emphasis on atonement seems to stray from the biblical presentation of the
   <i>
    parah adumah
   </i>
   as a ritual purification sacrifice and ceremony. The talmudic linkage to the idea of atonement is clarified by the
   <i>
    Tosafot
   </i>
   to that passage; it states that the
   <i>
    parah adumah,
   </i>
   as described in
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_19.1-22">
    Numbers 19
   </a>
   , provided atonement for the sin of the Golden Calf (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
    Exodus 32
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The theological idea that the death of Miriam, or any righteous person, enables atonement is a difficult concept for modern Jews to accept. Ours is evidently not the first generation to grapple with the notion of vicarious atonement, since it was already discussed in the 13th-century commentary of Rabbi Menachem ben Solomon Meiri. He stated that it is not the act of the righteous dying that atones for sins; rather, these deaths often move the living toward introspection and private acknowledgement of wrongdoing, which then results in personal prayer for repentance.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    <b>
     Miriam died there
    </b>
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#num_20.1-29">
    20:1
   </a>
   ). A rabbinic tradition (BT
   <i>
    Baba Batra
   </i>
   27a) states that six people did not die as ordinary mortals do. By the conventional method, as explained by the Rabbis, it is the Angel of Death who takes individuals from this world. The six who did not die in this manner experienced their deaths by God’s “kiss”—that is, their lives were taken by God directly. These six were Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. The Talmud discusses the last three individuals in this list, noting that the Torah text can be said to describe Moses and Aaron’s demise explicitly as “by the kiss of” God (translated in this book as “at the command of,” but literally “by the mouth of,”
   <a href="57_chapter_54.xhtml#deu34-5">
    Deuteronomy 34:5
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num33-38">
    Numbers 33:38
   </a>
   ). Miriam’s death “by the kiss of” God, however, is derived via a midrashic method that compares the technical language used in describing her death to the technical language used for the deaths of her brothers. The language is similar enough to imply that the details of their deaths were similar as well. After comparing these deaths, the Talmud then goes on to explain that Miriam’s death by God’s “kiss” is implicit rather than explicit, because it would be considered indelicate for her—the only woman on this list—to have been described in such a manner (BT
   <i>
    Mo’ed Katan
   </i>
   28a).

   ). This is the beginning of the song of thanksgiving that was recited by the Israelites after God gave them water from a well in the region of Beer (sometime after Miriam’s death). Although the Torah does not mention Miriam in connection with this biblical incident, rabbinic traditions did link her to it later. One of the ancient Aramaic translations of the Torah, the
   <i>
    Targum Yerushalmi,
   </i>
   incorporates an elaboration of this verse, explaining that this well was brought forth due to the merit of Miriam. It also links her to a tradition of wells associated with other biblical figures, namely, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, as well as other unnamed leaders.

The prophet Micah recognizes all three siblings as Israel’s leaders when he proclaims in God’s name: “I redeemed you from the house of bondage, and sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you” (Micah 6:4). Although the Bible preserves only a few direct references to Miriam, her importance to the Israelites’ story shines through even this leanest of biographical sketches. First, Miriam is called a prophet (in
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:20
   </a>
   , although her prophetic teachings are not recorded. Second, she sings and leads the women in song to God following her people’s safe passage across the Sea of Reeds (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:21
   </a>
   ). Third, she (along with Aaron) speaks out against Moses about his wife and his authority (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-2">
    12:1–2
   </a>
   ). Fourth, she is shut out of the camp when she is stricken with skin disease; tellingly, the Israelites refuse to move on until she returns (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-2">
    12:10–15
   </a>
   ). Finally, she dies and is buried in Kadesh (
   <a href="#num_20.1-29">
    20:1
   </a>
   ), a place name that evokes the holy

   These few references to Miriam are but clues to the larger story of her life and importance.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   Let us imagine that larger story by creating a midrash. Picture Moses as he climbed Mount Nebo to see the Promised Land he would never enter and to experience God’s drawing out his soul as gently as a kiss draws out the breath (
   <a href="57_chapter_54.xhtml#deu_34.1-12">
    Deuteronomy 34

   , at “Miriam died there”). What was he thinking at that moment? In the midrash we are creating we may imagine that this inspiring leader thought about the future of his people and about who would preserve the Covenant for future generations. First, he considered Aaron’s son Eleazar, who would carry on the priestly functions; he could reassure himself that the priests would preserve the teachings of the Torah. Indeed, for a time, the priests did maintain their role. However, following the destruction of the Second Temple, the priests no longer played a central role in the people’s observance of the Covenant. Moses then thought of Joshua, who was chosen to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. He could reassure himself that through the land, the faith would be preserved. Yet for nearly two millennia, the people of Israel would live in exile from the Promised Land. Finally, Moses then thought of Miriam. But failing to recognize earlier what she had contributed to preserving the faith, he realized that he had made no effort to ensure that her function be taken up by someone else.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Was there a leadership role that was lost with the death of Miriam? If the Israelites were to remain true to their religion in the generations to come, it would be because the women passed their faith and traditions on to their children. Moses’ efforts had gone into legislating primarily for the Israelite men and had largely neglected to consider the roles of women, who were often invisible in the legal codes. In our midrash, however, Miriam had seen to the women and the education of the children. What qualifications would there be for Miriam’s successor? Eleazar was destined for his priestly role by virtue of his lineage. Joshua had been chosen because he was judged to be a capable military commander. But whoever was to succeed Miriam would have to qualify directly through God’s gift, because no one had thought to name a successor. Moses, in that one prescient moment, understood that a vital piece of the community might have died with Miriam.

   than ourselves (as she did for her infant brother), to intervene in history regardless of our position (as she did when she approached the princess and when she challenged Moses’ conduct and leadership), and to dance as well as to sing publicly as a form of worship.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In our parashah, we learn something else as well: “The Israelites arrived in a body at the wilderness of Zin on the first new moon, and the people stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died there and was buried there. The community was without water, and they joined against Moses and Aaron” (
   <a href="#num_20.1-29">
    20:1–2
   </a>
   ). Rabbinic tradition, recognizing that something of major import was lost with the death of Miriam, found in the juxtaposition of Miriam’s death with the peoples’ crying out for water a powerful symbol for this loss. A midrash tells us that throughout the Israelites’ sojourn in the wilderness, a well followed them. With the death of Miriam, the well dried up. How can we best understand what Miriam’s Well represented?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Israel in the Bible had two main centers of practice: the Tent of Meeting (or Tabernacle, later replaced by the Temple) and the home. The rules governing the Tent of Meeting take up much of Leviticus, but the life that is to be conducted in the home receives relatively little mention. Moses, we might say, had focused on institutional religion. But in our midrashic rendering of the story, Miriam’s gift was to raise up the personal practices of the Israelites and to help the women of Israel recognize and claim their homes as a sacred place. Each woman’s own Sabbath table became like an altar. While Moses showed the Israelites the God who spoke to them from the top of Sinai, Miriam enabled the women to see that God could also be found around the cooking fires in their own tents.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Miriam also helped the women change their idea of holy space (from the set-apart Tent of Meeting to their own homes). In a time when the male leaders were focusing on all that was separate and distinct, Miriam taught the women to find the holy wherever they were open to it, whenever they could be responsive.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   And just as her imagined teachings sought to move beyond separation, her own tradition is not to be found in a separate text but in the words that mothers have told their daughters and sons since then: God is found in and through all that we remember, all that we experience, all that we hope for. Miriam’s Well stands for what is nourishing and life-giving—it stands for the dining table, the cradle, and the welcoming embrace of our loved ones.
