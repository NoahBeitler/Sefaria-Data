    S THEIR FORTY YEARS’ JOURNEY
   </small>
   in the wilderness is coming to an end, the Israelites’ focus shifts to final preparations for entering the Promised Land. It is a time of uncertainty in the face of transition.
   <i>
    Parashat Pinchas
   </i>
   (named after the priest known in English as Phinehas) describes actions and instructions for securing stability and continuity, with special attention to division of the land among the Israelite tribes. The setting is the plains of Moab, on the eastern side of the Jordan near Jericho (
   <a href="#num25-43">
    25:43
   </a>
   ), within view of the Promised Land. The opening verses conclude the disturbing incident of Baal-peor (
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_25.1-9">
    25:1–9
   </a>
   ). After a census and the appointment of Moses’ successor, the parashah ends with a lengthy account of the sacrificial offerings for various sacred occasions. The final words of the Torah portion affirm that Moses instructed Israel according to God’s commands (
   <a href="#num30-1">
    30:1
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Five daring sisters—Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah, also known as Zelophehad’s daughters—loom large in this Torah portion, and again later in
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
    Numbers 36
   </a>
   (and also Joshua 17). They brilliantly challenge the inheritance system (which has disenfranchised them) when they request a share in the land (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    27:1–11
   </a>
   ). They are so important that each of their names appears in every episode about them. In this episode these sisters succeed in securing a legacy for themselves, so that they, rather than their father’s male relatives, will inherit his portion. But they do even more than that, something unique and extraordinary: they initiate a Torah law, a legal precept that becomes a legacy for future generations because what they ask for themselves becomes a law sanctioned by God. This case is important in showing (among other things) women who challenge community practices and who thereby bring significant modifications to existing legislation in order to meet changing social needs.

   The resolution of their case is that brotherless daughters can inherit parental property. Thus, this new law preserves the integrity of family property in case only daughters are born to an Israelite couple. It also provides economic security to daughters who otherwise would depend on male relatives for sustenance.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   A striking aspect of these stories about Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah concerns archeological information about territorial holdings in Israel during the monarchy. Two of these names—Noah and Hoglah—appear on ostraca (ancient clay fragments). The names seem to refer to areas of considerable size in northern Israel (see at
   <a href="#num_27.1-11">
    27:1–2
   </a>
   ).

   Other fascinating women make cameo appearances as mother (Jochebed,
   <a href="#chap-fn59-2">
    26:59
   </a>
   ), sister (Miriam,
   <a href="#chap-fn59-2">
    26:59
   </a>
   ), or daughter; yet they are remembered mainly in relation to an important man. We find also the “dangerous” foreign woman (Cozbi;
   <a href="#num25-15">
    25:15–18
   </a>
   ) and the mysterious Serah, who is named only to disappear without a story (

   ).

   lthough the five sisters Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah will feature prominently in this Torah portion, it begins with Phinehas (in Hebrew,
   <i>
    Pinchas
   </i>
   ). It concludes the gruesome episode that took place in the previous parashah: Israel succumbed to the sin of idolatry, and Phinehas the priest—Aaron’s grandson—responded by slaying a couple who had committed idolatry in front of the community. Now God rewards Phinehas. (For a different interpretation, see
   <i>
    Balak,
   </i>
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#page_954">
    Another View
   </a>
   .)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This opening scene is disturbing for a number of reasons: first, because the new generation of Israelites falls prey to idolatry—and does so within view of the Promised Land; second, because Phinehas is rewarded for acting violently and without recourse to due process; and third, because women (albeit foreign) receive a disproportionate blame for the people’s downfall.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="num_vv.10-13">
   PHINEHAS’S REWARD: PERMANENT PRIESTLY LEADERSHIP (25:10–13)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   God rewards Phinehas with hereditary priesthood, elevating him above other descendants of Aaron. Why? The reason seems to be Phinehas’s swift and ruthless response to idolatry. Unlike his grandfather Aaron, who collaborated with idolators in the infamous case of the Golden Calf (see
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
    Exodus 32
   </a>
   , especially vv. 5 and 21–25), Phinehas demonstrates unflinching loyalty to God. He thus restores the stature of priests as deserving mediators between Israel and God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Although God had ordered death for all the ringleaders (
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num25-4">
    25:4
   </a>
   ), Phinehas satisfies God’s demand for punishment by the single act of slaying two leaders. He thereby causes less rather than more bloodshed.

   Literally, “covenant of peace.” In
   <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num_6.1-27">
    Numbers 6
   </a>
   , God requires that the priests transmit blessings of peace. (See “And grant you peace” in the conclusion of the Priestly Benediction,

   According to later narratives, Israel’s chief priests descended from Phinehas rather than from Aaron’s other descendants.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="num_vv.14-18">
   THE CULPRITS AND THEIR CRIME (25:14–18)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   For the first time, the narrator discloses the name and rank of Phinehas’s victims: Zimri the Israelite man and Cozbi the Midianite woman. Their story articulates a theme that recurs in several biblical books: the potentially dangerous influence of foreign women.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In some cases, foreign women play a positive role, helping to ensure survival. The daughter of Pharaoh saves Moses (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E2-5">
    Exodus 2:5–10
   </a>
   ). Zipporah, Moses’ Midianite wife, averts God’s wrath by circumcising their son (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E4-24">
    Exodus 4:24–26
   </a>
   ). Rahab the harlot helps Israelite spies (Joshua 2). Jael saves the nation by killing its arch-enemy Sisera (Judges 4). Ruth the Moabite sustains Naomi and becomes an ancestress of King David (Ruth 4:17–22).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Elsewhere, however, women are blamed for leading Israelite men to idolatry. Thus the warning in
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">
    Exodus 34:16
   </a>
   : “And when you take wives from among their daughters for your sons, their daughters will lust after their gods and will cause your sons to lust after their gods.” (See also
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#chap-fn1-4a">
    Deuteronomy 7:4
   </a>
   , which adds that God’s anger will blaze, “promptly wiping you out.”) In addition, I Kings 11:1–13 blames Solomon’s fall from grace on his foreign wives, and I Kings 18 portrays Queen Jezebel, a Phoenician princess married to an Israelite king, as a major proponent of idolatry. Recognizing women’s powerful influence on cultural and religious life, the Bible at certain junctures expresses anxiety over foreign women. The standard charge is idolatry, often cast in sexual terms. Women who keep their own religious traditions instead of Israel’s seem to threaten the entire fabric of the nation. They possess the potential to lure their husbands and future generations away from fidelity to Israelite traditions. The danger is deemed acute in times of transition, when Israel’s boundaries—social as well as political—are not clearly established, as here, when entering the land.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Cozbi’s name derives from a Hebrew root
   <i>
    k-z-b,
   </i>
   meaning “a lie” or “falsehood.” Both Cozbi and Zimri come from leading families. In the previous Torah portion, responsibility for initiating this crisis had already been placed on women: “they,” specifically the women (the verb is in feminine plural form), invited the people to offer sacrifices to “their” (again, feminine form) god (for details, see at
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num_25.1-9">
    25:1–2
   </a>
   ). Here Cozbi receives the greater share of the blame. She is mentioned twice (
   <a href="#num_25.19-26.65">
    see below
   </a>
   ); Zimri is mentioned only once.

    </b>
   </i>
   She alone now represents the entire episode. This scandal becomes known as “the affair of Cozbi,” not “the affair of Zimri,” the Israelite man. The repetition of her name here, this time with no reference to Zimri, singles her out as the dominant symbol of this sinful event that will mar Israel’s relations with the Midianites (see also
   <a href="45_chapter_42.xhtml#num_31.1-54">

   Literally, “their sister.” In the census that follows, Miriam will be identified by the same Hebrew phrase (
   <a href="#num26-59">
    26:59
   </a>
   ; see there). The foreign woman as sister appears here as a source of death, whereas the Israelite sister remains a preserver of life.

   </i>
   For Rashi, her pedigree teaches “the extent of the Midianites’ hatred, who went so far as to prostitute a king’s daughter in order to bring Israel into sin.” His interpretation thus shifts some blame away from Cozbi to her family.

   he list of the men reared in the wilderness and those destined to inherit the Promised Land links the past with the future to establish continuity. The census identifies those who survived the journey (and the recent debacle at Peor), as well as the men whose households will receive land. The order follows the earlier list of those who began the journey in
   <a href="37_chapter_34.xhtml#num_1.1-54">

   In this verse, emphasis falls on the women’s family positions: Jochebed as wife and mother, and Miriam as a daughter as well as “their sister.” In this census, the constellation of birth references is unique. The text records Jochebed’s own birth, itself an unusual detail. Obviously all the persons named in the census list have mothers, but the reference here emphasizes that these particular family events are not merely personal but of national consequence. The brief references suggest, in telegraphic fashion, that it is precisely their actions as mother and sister that matter for the life of Israel. One thereby remembers the wife, Jochebed, who not only bore a child but took exceptional risks to protect him, and Miriam the sister who supervised his rescue and reconnected him with his mother (

   he story of Zelophehad’s daughters appears in three different places in the Bible (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    Numbers 27
   </a>
   and
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
    36
   </a>
   ; Joshua 17) and concerns itself with providing land for five remarkable daughters who, as sisters, always appear together. So important are they that their names are repeated in full in each episode. The fact that they receive so much “press” in the Bible is itself proof of their significance. But it takes attention to details to appreciate fully their accomplishments.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In the Torah, the story of Zelophehad’s daughters depicts a two-part reformulation of a law, enabling daughters to inherit land (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    Numbers 27
   </a>
   and
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
    36
   </a>
   ). In the first part, the daughters receive a promise of land; in the second, the law concerning the land is amended (see at
   <a href="46_chapter_43.xhtml#num_36.1-12">
    Numbers 36
   </a>
   ). Finally, Joshua and other leaders then implement the law (at the sisters’ request) in Joshua 17, and the women take possession of their land.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   One notes two striking features of the story. First, disenfranchised women successfully confront an unjust system and propose a more equitable law. Second, God approves of their proposal and formulates it as a new law, one that enables other women as well to inherit land in certain circumstances. As unmarried women whose father had died, the five daughters represent the least powerful members of the community. Yet they dare challenge the tradition and call for change when the tradition is unjust. In the end, their proposal becomes God’s Torah. Rashi notes this dramatic development when he explicitly attributes this new Torah to the women. Their law, he says, “deserved to have been written by Moses”; but the women were worthy and hence “it was written by them.”
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The story matters for other weighty reasons as well: it offers crucial information about land rights and kinship structures, as well as about the roles and status of women; it provides a rare opportunity for seeing how the legal process was perceived in biblical Israel. Thus the implications of the story extend beyond concern with the women in question. But the fact that the women in the Torah initiate this particular process and even the law itself, makes their story extraordinary.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Only three other cases in the entire Torah describe a legislative process in action: the cases of (1) the blasphemer (
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_24.10-23">
    Leviticus 24:10–22
   </a>
   ); (2) those impure for the passover sacrifice (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#N9-6">
    Numbers 9:6–14
   </a>
   ); and (3) the Shabbat violator (
   <a href="40_chapter_37.xhtml#N15-32">
    15:32–36
   </a>
   ). These three narratives describe procedural debates about applying already existing laws. But only the case of the five sisters shows a law actually being created, not merely applied. Moreover, this law is first proposed by people and only then confirmed, approved and extended by God as Torah. What perhaps makes this story most extraordinary and crucially important is that the people who create this Torah teaching are five women: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

   The sisters are introduced by name, not merely as Zelophehad’s daughters. Their names recur in each episode (though the order varies for no apparent reason). The meanings of their names remain uncertain but the impact of their actions in the Bible is clear. In addition, archeologists have discovered two of these names, Noah and Hoglah, listed as town names on clay fragments from the 8th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   , known as the Samaria Ostraca (see at
   <a href="#page_973">

   ). Similarly, Tirzah, Milcah, and Mahlah appear as names of towns or regions in Israelite territory in various biblical texts (see below at

   THE SISTERS’ REQUEST: TO INHERIT THEIR FATHER’S LAND (27:3–4)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The women first challenge an unfair system but then immediately propose a solution. Their choice of words is astute. They use the language of loyalty to family, making a claim on behalf of their dead father. By emphasizing the desire to perpetuate their father’s name, they speak to a timely communal and familial concern in an era of transition.

   By distancing their father from Korah, who had rebelled against Aaron (see
   <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#num_16.1-35">
    Numbers 16
   </a>
   ), the daughters legitimate themselves in at least two ways. First, they explain that their father did not forfeit his inheritance (see
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#N26-11">
    26:11

   above). Second, they distance themselves from suspicion of illegitimate challenge to authority.

   </i>
   Preserving a man’s name—that is, his property and legacy—stands out as a venerable obligation in the Bible (see the levirate laws of
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#D25-5">
    Deuteronomy 25:5–10
   </a>
   ). The women thus cleverly frame their request in the shared language of communal, especially male, concern.

   As some rabbinic sages note, the women make clear their desire to remain connected to community and family. This statement adds moral force to their request.

   THE RESULTS: THE SISTERS RECEIVE THE PROMISE OF LAND (27:5–11)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The women’s request launches a process that leads to a new law. Furthermore, this episode may reflect the historical reality that some women were inheritors of territory. A significant discovery early in the 20th century brought to light dozens of ostraca dating to the mid-8th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   These ostraca come from Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom. (Ostraca are shards of pottery inscribed with ink; they were often used for short notes or for administrative records.) Some sixty-six ostraca record the delivery of fine oil and wine, perhaps as taxes, from the surrounding towns in the territory of Manasseh to the capital. The names of two of the five daughters of Zelophehad appear in these fragments, each in three different inscriptions: Hoglah and Noah. The appearance of those names on the ostraca, together with the fact that Joshua 17:3–6 lists all five daughters as receivers of land in the northern region of Manasseh, suggests that these women were significant figures in early Israel. It is conceivable that the five sisters are among the ancestors whose names became toponyms (place names). This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that many of the other fragments from Samaria also mention other names from Joshua 17, referring to individuals who appear elsewhere as clan names as well as territory names. [Carol Meyers contributed to the discussion of these ostraca in this commentary.

    mishpat,
   </i>
   a noun that is often rendered elsewhere as “law” or “rule”; see, for example,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 21:1
   </a>
   when it categorizes the laws given at Sinai. What must be stressed, therefore, is that
   <i>
    their
   </i>
   (namely, the daughters’) rule or law now goes before God.

      “The plea of Zelophehad’s daughters is just.”
     </a>

   God responds with emphatic approval—literally, “Rightly the daughters of Zelophehad speak.”
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   God issues two related demands. First, here God decrees that the leaders grant the women’s request. God’s language practically repeats that of the daughters, emphasizing that their petition be fulfilled in accordance with their request.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The one difference strengthens their claim: in an astonishing move, God adds that this land be given to them as “hereditary.” They not only get a holding (
   <i>
    achuzah
   </i>
   ) but receive land that they can bestow as an inheritance on others (
   <i>
    nachalah
   </i>
   ). The women who sought to ensure that their father’s name not be written out of history now enter history themselves by gaining a legacy of land and law.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">

     <a href="#chap-fn8-3" id="chap-fn08-3">
      8–11.
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Second, God extends this decree as a law for all generations. God issues a general law to accommodate the five daughters. What these daughters request will benefit other women in the same situation. Daughters now take precedence over other family members when there are no sons. (See further at

   The practice of ordaining someone by means of laying hands is modeled on this first investiture of authority by Moses. The word

   </span>
   he sacrificial system entails sharing the benefits of the land with God as well as providing support for the landless priests. The prospect of the death of Moses the mediator leads to greater emphasis on laws that will bind God and Israel more closely together. The word “offerings,” also translated as “sacrifices,” comes from the root
   <i>
    k-r-b,
   </i>
   meaning “bring near.” Integral to the biblical notion of sacrifice is the understanding that offerings bring God and humanity closer. These offerings thus serve to ensure continuity of the relationship between God and Israel when Israel possesses the land. The feasts also bring Israelites together as a community.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Extensive regulations for holy occasions appear also in
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_23.1-44">
    Leviticus 23
   </a>
   , though some of the details vary. For this reason, the instructions in Numbers are interpreted as “additional” sacrifices or
   <i>
    musaf.
   </i>
   After the destruction of the Second Temple, the
   <i>
    musaf
   </i>
   as additional offerings was replaced by the
   <i>
    Musaf
   </i>
   as an additional service in the synagogue. (On sacrificial offerings, see also the
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#page_569">
    introduction to
    <i>
     parashat Vayikra
    </i>
   </a>
   , and at
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    Leviticus 1–7
   </a>
   .)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Most of the sacrifices follow a similar pattern: two bulls, one ram, seven lambs, and a goat for a purgation offering. The Shabbat requires only two lambs and no other animal offerings. The Feast of Booths (or Sukkot) differs considerably. The number of sacrificial animals is much larger: fourteen lambs and two rams daily. In addition, the number of bulls changes daily, decreasing from fourteen to seven, adding up to a total of seventy bulls. Because the number seventy represents the nations of the world (see
   <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_10.1-32">
    Genesis 10
   </a>
   ), the rabbinic sages concluded that these offerings include an invocation for protection of the gentile nations (Rashi and BT
   <i>
    Sukkah
   </i>
   55b). Presumably women were expected to bring offerings to the shrine and to participate in at least a number of communal religious practices.
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu_12.1-16.17">
    Deuteronomy 16:11
   </a>
   and
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu_12.1-16.17">
    14
   </a>
   specify that women are to celebrate certain feasts with the rest of the household. Also, several biblical texts (see
   <a href="30_chapter_27.xhtml#L12-8">
    Leviticus 12:6
   </a>
   and I Samuel 1:25) as well as ancient Near Eastern depictions portray women as offering sacrifices (see at
   <a href="27_chapter_24.xhtml#levi_1.1-3.17">
    Leviticus 1:5
   </a>
   ). On women’s participation in Israelite celebrations, see also

    HIS PARASHAH STARTS
   </small>
   in a significant place: in the aftermath of the momentous events at Peor. One would think that the reward of Phinehas should have concluded the last parashah instead of starting a new one. But this new parashah is about the future; specifically, changes God makes for the future, changes that affect the priesthood, the government, and the women of Israel.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   <i>
    Concerning Phinehas.
   </i>
   A more literal translation of
   <a href="#chap-fn011-1">
    v. 11
   </a>
   may make it easier to understand why Phinehas is rewarded for his violent act. Phinehas “was zealous for
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   ’s zeal.”
   <i>
    Kinah
   </i>
   (“zeal” or “jealousy”) is the furious sense of righteous indignation that one may feel when one has been betrayed by someone who owed one allegiance and fidelity.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   A husband may feel “a fit of jealousy” (
   <a href="38_chapter_35.xhtml#num5-14">
    5:14
   </a>
   ), and Israel is warned many times that God is a “jealous God” (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_20.1-14">
    Exodus 20:5
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e34-13">

   </a>
   ;
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#D4-24">

   </a>
   ;
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#D5-10">
    5:9
   </a>
   ; Joshua 24:19) and that this “jealousy” may make God utterly destroy Israel if they abandon God (
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#D6-14">
    Deuteronomy 6:14–15
   </a>
   ). Now God’s wrath has been kindled and a plague is raging within the Israelite camp when Phinehas steps in to prevent God from wiping out all of Israel. Like Elijah, who is also “zealous for
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="ltr">
    יהוה
   </span>
   ” (I Kings 19:10), Phinehas empathizes with God’s rage and acts it out. He acts with violence to stop violence, like setting a backfire to stop a wildfire.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Phinehas’s action works. But in the new world that this parashah is setting up, God does not want to perpetuate the cycle of violence. And so, even in the act of rewarding Phinehas, God establishes a new order by granting him a “covenant of peace” (
   <i>
    shalom,
   </i>
   not “friendship”) in
   <a href="#num25-12">
    25:12
   </a>
   . The eternal priesthood will create peace and reconciliation, not by killing evildoers but by the sacrificial system. Their violence is limited to killing an animal—the bloodshed confined to dashing the blood on the altar. Once again, a careful translation brings out the meaning: “he and his seed will have a covenant of eternal priesthood because he was zealous for his God, and he will make atonement for the Children of Israel” (
   <a href="#num25-12">
    25:13
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Phinehas has been much discussed in our tradition. Psalm 106:30 states only that Phinehas stood in prayer and thus stopped the plague. During the Maccabean period, Phinehas was the model for Mattathias, who also acted with zeal for God (I Maccabees 2:26, 50–64). Eventually, the Rabbis became uncomfortable with the idea of people taking the law into their own hands, and they transformed even the image of Phinehas into a calm presenter of legal argument. In their assessment of this parashah, although recognizing Phinehas’s pure motives, they frame his act as part of the past—never to be repeated—but rather to be replaced by the ordinary actions of priests.

   In this parashah the priests figure also in the new role for the leader. Moses appoints Joshua his successor, but with a difference: Joshua will not have all of Moses’ powers. Instead, Joshua is a temporal ruler, neither priest nor prophet. But the priests, using the Urim and Thummim, will channel God’s commands (

   <i>
    Concerning the Daughters of Zelophehad.
   </i>
   Part of this new world order involves the right of brotherless women to inherit their father’s land. This decision is similar to the ancient Greek rule of the
   <i>
    epi-klara,
   </i>
   who also inherits her father’s land and must marry her kin. Often we assume that this makes the women just a “place marker,” holding the empty place in the paternal succession; but the story of the Shunammite in
   <a id="page_983">
   </a>
   II Kings 4 and 8 shows how important it is to a woman to hold land. The wealthy Shunammite becomes the prophet Elisha’s benefactor; when he offers a reward, she responds, “I live among my own kin” (II Kings 4:13). Unusually, she has not left her kin to live with her husband’s family. Alone among the childless women of the Bible, she is not actively seeking a child. (However, once she gives birth, she is fiercely protective of her son.) Later, Elisha warns her of famine; she leaves the land and returns seven years later to petition the king to give her back her property. She comes to cry for “her land and her field,” and the king instructs, “Return to her all that is hers.” In a comparable situation elsewhere in the Bible, the land Naomi seeks to sell is carefully called “the portion of field that belonged to our brother Elimelech” (Ruth 4:3), and the property is called “all that was Elimelech’s” (Ruth 4:8). The fact that the Shunammite’s land is
   <i>
    hers
   </i>
   and that she lives among
   <i>
    her
   </i>
   people suggests that she is a latter-day daughter of Zelophehad: she lives among her own kin, and her land belongs to her. And what a difference this makes: she is independent in her actions and not worried about her lack of children. The economic security of owning her own land gives her independence from her husband; she neither asks his permission to be Elisha’s patron nor to seek the prophet as a client. The Shunammite may be an example of how women act when the economic constraints of patriarchy are removed. This is why she is identified by place rather than by name or as “Mrs. Somebody.” Shunem is her village—the village of her father’s household and the village where she lives as an adult woman, the locale of the land that she owns. She is a woman of place and—by contrast—she shows how significant the lack of such place is to most women’s history.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The limitation of women’s property rights is the economic linchpin of patriarchal structure. The basic fact that women did not normally own land in ancient Israel made them economically dependent on men—first on their fathers, then on their husbands, and ultimately on their sons. But the daughters of Zelophehad—and the rule that they initiated—let some women escape this dependence.

   (
   <a href="#num25-15">

   ). As related at the end of the last parashah, Phinehas the priest killed Cozbi and her Israelite lover, Zimri, at Shittim (
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#num25-6">
    25:6–9

   ). Some traditions portray the highly born Cozbi as the innocent victim of her father’s hatred for Israel. According to Midrash
   <i>
    B’midbar Rabbah
   </i>
   21.3, Zur was so eager to ensnare the Israelites in sin (
   <a href="43_chapter_40.xhtml#N25-1">
    Numbers 25:1–5
   </a>
   ) that he sacrificed his own daughter, a princess, to harlotry.
   <i>
    B’midbar Rabbah
   </i>
   20.24 relates that Zur had instructed Cozbi to have relations with no one but Moses, but Zimri convinced her that he was even higher in rank.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   BT
   <i>
    Sanhedrin

   82a, discussing consequences for men who have sexual relations with non-Jewish women, denigrates Cozbi, a reflection of the considerable sexual anxiety the Rabbis harbored about the attractions of foreign women. Cozbi’s name is linked to
   <i>
    kazav,
   </i>
   the Hebrew word for “falsehood,” and she is castigated in the coarsest terms as a common prostitute.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   This passage about Cozbi also reveals the serious problems raised for rabbinic commentators by Moses’ passivity in the face of the events at Shittim and by Phinehas’s
   <a id="page_984">
   </a>
   extreme zealotry. The Rabbis explain that Zimri justified his relationship with Cozbi to Moses and the elders of Israel on the grounds that Moses had also taken a foreign consort, the Midianite Zipporah. Moses was rendered speechless by this challenge, and his great-nephew, the fervent Phinehas, had to remind him of the prohibition against cohabitation with foreign women, a law that Moses himself had taught the people when he descended from Mount Sinai.
   <i>
    B’midbar Rabbah
   </i>
   20.24 describes how Moses’ failure to act at this moment of crisis demoralized all the Israelites except Phinehas and concludes that it was in punishment for this public weakness that Moses was buried in an unknown location. The passage concludes, “This serves to teach you that we must each be as fierce as a leopard, swift as an eagle, fleet as a hart, and strong as a lion in the performance of our Maker’s will.”

   <a href="14_chapter_11.xhtml#g46-17">
    Genesis 46:17
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis transform Serah into the longest-lived individual in midrashic literature and praise her for her wisdom. They attribute her remarkable longevity to the potent blessing that her grandfather Jacob was said to have given her after she informed him through music that Joseph was still alive. BT
   <i>
    Sotah

   13a relates that it was Serah who later showed Moses where Joseph was buried at the time of the Exodus so that his coffin might be returned to the land of Israel. Midrash
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah

   94.9 identifies her also with the clever woman who negotiated on behalf of her city with David’s general Joab (II Samuel 20:16–22). And Midrash
   <i>
    P’sikta D’Rav Kahana
   </i>
   11:13 even imagines the venerable Serah resolving rabbinic disputes about events that she witnessed in biblical times. In medieval writings, Serah is among the nine human beings who are said to have entered heaven alive; according to the

   (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    27:1
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis taught: “When the daughters of Zelophehad heard that the land of Israel was being apportioned among the males of the tribes but not the females, they consulted together as to how to make their claim. They said: ‘The compassion of God is not like human compassion. Human rulers are more concerned with males than with females—but the One who spoke and brought the world into being is not like that. Rather, God shows mercy to every living thing, as Scripture says,
   <i>
    Who gives food to all flesh
   </i>
   <b>
    /
   </b>
   <i>
    Whose steadfast love is eternal

   </i>
   <b>
    /
   </b>
   <i>
    God’s mercy is upon all God’s works
   </i>
   (Psalm 145:9).”’ This rabbinic midrash from
   <i>
    Sifrei B’midbar
   </i>
   133 represents the daughters of Zelophehad as canny and competent women who trusted that divine mercy would transcend the mutable norms of a human society in which women were subordinate beings. According to the Rabbis, these admirable sisters epitomized the females of the wilderness generation who consistently outshone their male contemporaries in their faith in God and their personal courage.
   <i>
    B’midbar Rabbah
   </i>
   21.10 relates that women refused to participate in making the Golden Calf; they also rejected the disheartening counsel of the scouts who warned of the dangers of invading Canaan. Similarly, the daughters of Zelophehad are understood to have demonstrated their complete confidence in the ultimate fulfillment of the divine promise when they petition Moses to secure their inheritance in the land of Israel.

   119b praises the daughters of Zelophehad in three ways: as intelligent women, since they spoke at an opportune moment; as scriptural exegetes knowledgeable in Jewish law, since they were aware of the legal issues involved in their situation; and as sexually chaste, since they did not marry until their inheritance
   <a id="page_985">

   status was resolved, despite their advanced ages. The rabbinic sages awarded the daughters of Zelophehad this exalted standing among biblical women because they prompted Moses to seek divine help in clarifying the laws of succession of property. Nor did it hurt that God supported the sisters’ claim. According to
   <i>

    v. 53
   </a>
   ). “Among these” refers to the males listed in the census; hence, we can conclude that Zelophehad’s daughters were not counted in the census and also were not to receive any land as inheritance.

   We might expect that women, heirs to Egyptian slavery and then put under law that frequently favors men, might react by keeping silent, by accepting as natural the rule decreed for them to follow. We might expect women in those days to stay close to their tents, remain out of sight, and not go far from their families. So how and why did Zelophehad’s daughters write a new chapter in history? First, they dared to “go out” from their living place, from their social space, from the destiny imposed on them. The text states: “The daughters of Zelophehad…came forward. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the chieftains, and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    27:1–2
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Let’s imagine the scene: the Israelite camp is formed of tribes, each of whom has a determined place, with the Tabernacle in the middle; and in the center stand the main authority figures, all of them men: Moses, the priest Eleazar, and the chieftains. Imposing as this structure may have been, the five sisters decide to claim their rights. Together, they go out of their tents, without being called by anyone, to the place where only the high-ranking men congregate, to the place where the Tablets from Sinai rest in the Ark, to the place of holiness and authority, to a place where women did not have authority. These men must have been overwhelmed when they saw such a startling, unprecedented situation!

  <div class="tab-enin">
   But this is not all that the five sisters do. They not
   <a id="page_986">
   </a>
   only come forth, but also they speak with determination: “Our father died in the wilderness. He was not one of the faction, Korah’s faction, which banded together against
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   , but died for his own sin; and he has left no sons. Let not our father’s name be lost to his clan just because he had no son! Give us a holding among our father’s kinsmen!” (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#num_27.1-11">
    Numbers 27:3–4
   </a>
   ). Let’s analyze what this text reflects about these women. First, note that these women know their law and history. They use the fact that their father was not involved in Korah’s rebellion (
   <a href="41_chapter_38.xhtml#num_16.1-35">
    Numbers 16
   </a>
   ) as evidence to support his—and their—claim to the land. They know that the continuity of family name depends on inheritance of the land; and they realize that the current law is not adequate, for it does not take into account the unusual circumstances of a man without sons. They possess the acumen to recognize this omission—in God’s law! But because they consider God’s law to be just, or to aim to be just, they show no hesitation in pointing out the unfair nature of the present situation with complete confidence and supporting their claim with compelling arguments.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   How does Moses react? The following verse states: “Moses brought their case before
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="ltr">
    יהוה
   </span>
   ” (
   <a href="#page_973">
    27:5
   </a>
   ). Moses discloses his inability to assess the claims of these sisters. He takes the case to God, who responds by unequivocally supporting the sisters’ demand and even by promulgating a new and permanent law to secure inheritance for any daughters in such circumstances (
   <a href="#num27-6">
    27:6–8
   </a>
   ). Thus, the sisters’ claim leads to the law of inheritance’s being changed forever.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   As stated above, a key to the sisters’ success is their full awareness of God’s laws and the people’s history and story. They insist on change by engaging Israelite traditions effectively, something the rabbinic sages recognized when they described the women. According to the Talmud (BT
   <i>
    Bava Batra
   </i>
   119b), Zelophehad’s daughters were wise (
   <i>
    chachamot),
   </i>
   astute interpreters (
   <i>
    darshanyiot
   </i>
   ), and pious (
   <i>
    rachmanyiot)
   </i>
   : “wise” because they spoke in the precise moment when the decision was issued; “interpreters” because they in essence said, “If our father had a son, we would not have spoken—because he would have the inheritance”; and “pious” because they did not want to marry men who were not worthy.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The achievement of Zelophehad’s daughters was a landmark in women’s rights regarding the inheritance of land, from those days up to now. In addition, however, the story of these five women offers a compelling lesson for all those who believe that their destiny is fixed or that divine justice has abandoned them. It encourages us to think differently—and provides a message of hope for all those faced with obstacles.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Perhaps the most important legacy of Zelophehad’s daughters is their call to us to take hold of life with our own hands, to move from the place that the others have given us—or that we have decided to keep because we feel immobile—and to walk, even to the most holy center, to where nobody seems to be able to go. After all, nothing is more sacred than life itself and the fight for what we believe is worthy. Thus, this parashah inspires us to discover that we too have the ability to know what is right for ourselves and what our rights ought to be. When we believe in our capacity to shape our history, to the point of being able to change even a law that came from the Revelation at Sinai, then we pay a tribute to Zelophehad’s daughters.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In our era, we can see this legacy in women such as Judith Eisenstein, who was the first to become a bat mitzvah in 1922, and in the first women ordained as rabbis: Regina Jonas (in 1935), Sally Priesand (Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in 1973), Sandy Sasso (Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in 1974), and Amy Eilberg (Jewish Theological Seminary in 1985). Like Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah, they and the many other courageous women who followed in their footsteps came forth and opened the future for all women seeking to reclaim their Jewish inheritance in new and powerful ways.
