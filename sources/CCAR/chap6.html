   (“generations”) begins with Isaac but focuses heavily on Rebekah as the more active member of this family. Rebekah runs the family and undertakes the task of determining the destiny of God’s blessings. As the one who blesses, Isaac has authority; but in determining who gets blessed—seemingly against Isaac’s intentions—Rebekah has the power. She independently seeks God and alone receives God’s answer about the future.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   This parashah recounts a family story. A mother gives birth to twins, Esau and Jacob; and from the beginning, the brothers vie for prominence and their parents’ favor. Like other biblical narratives in Genesis, this parashah is also concerned with self-definition—with the identity of the Israelite community in relation to surrounding peoples and cultures. Rebekah’s twins represent two distinct nations: Israel and Edom.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Rebekah occupies center stage in several key scenes. Energetically, Rebekah ensures that the covenantal blessings will be bestowed on the more suitable son. Isaac, eclipsed by his parents, wife, and offspring, simply goes along—passively and gently surviving.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   As Alice Bellis observes, interpreters often object to Rebekah’s manipulations of her husband, comparing her unfavorably with Sarah’s treatment of Hagar in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    Genesis 16
   </a>
   and
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_21.8-21">
    21
   </a>
   , as if “[abusing] a woman servant is acceptable; deceiving a man, even to achieve God’s mission, is not” (

   ,
   <i>
    and Heroes: Women’s Stories in the Hebrew Bible
   </i>
   , 1994, p. 83). The Torah, however, presents Rebekah as a figure without whom the covenant will not continue properly, the necessary link between Abraham’s blessing and Jacob’s.

   he opening unit focuses on Rebekah’s pregnancy: how it came about, what was its nature, what steps she took, and what was the result. Twenty years after we first meet her in
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24
   </a>
   , Rebekah again proves resourceful and energetic, as she seeks God to inquire about her distressing situation.

   Rebekah has been identified several times in

   We do not learn about Rebekah’s feelings concerning her childlessness, nor are we told that she does anything to try to change the situation. Isaac could have taken other wives to solve the problem of continuity (see at “childless,” below), but he apparently does not. Isaac’s sensitivity to Rebekah stands out in contrast to Jacob, who chastises his barren wife Rachel when she asks for children (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#G30-2">

   ) and Rachel’s (29:31). In contrast to stories about these other matriarchs or Hannah, we are not told that Rebekah resorts to “extreme measures” to ensure fertility. Ancient Near Eastern documents describe adoption as one of the strategies for handling the social and economic problems resulting from lack of progeny. Another potential solution is reflected in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    Genesis 16
   </a>
   , where Sarah gives Abraham her handmaid Hagar in order to produce an offspring. Elsewhere in the Bible, women resort to prayer (Hannah in I Samuel 1) or a presumed fertility plant (see Rachel bargaining with Leah for mandrakes in

   </i>
   Literally, “why am I?” Interpreters often say that Rebekah is bemoaning her physical pain. However, the text mentions only that the pregnancy is unsettling, not that it is painful. Instead, what prompts her question may be the prospect of multiple children, which in the Bible typically signals a special destiny. Far from complaining about her condition, Rebekah is wondering about her role in such destiny. God’s answer (v. 23) confirms such a reading, since it refers to the children’s future.

   a verb that usually designates a formal consultation, in this case with God. The text pointedly omits any mention of mediated communication, which suggests that Rebekah addresses God directly, and that God responds to her with equal directness (v. 23). The earlier picture of Rebekah as gutsy, independent, and resourceful (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24
   </a>
   ) thus continues. Yet many interpreters both ancient and modern have distanced Rebekah from a direct contact with God. One rabbinic commentator claimed, for example, that she went to a house of study (see,
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#page_150">
    Post-biblical Interpretations
   </a>
   ). Some modern feminist commentators have speculated that she receives the information in a dream (see citations in Alice Beilis,

   God replies to Rebekah directly, informing her—not Isaac—about their sons’ future. Two other biblical mothers to whom God discloses their son’s future are Hagar (16:10–12,
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G21-17">

   The poetic Hebrew is more ambiguous than the translation indicates—literally “elder serve younger,” which could also mean that the younger shall serve the elder. The text may seek to suggest that Jacob’s subsequent preeminence results from Rebekah’s interpretation. | The election of the younger over the elder is a theme that pervades Genesis. It may reflect a conflict relating to the audience’s national identity and the formation of a people in which newer traditions are integrated with older ones.

    Favoritism and the Selling of the Birthright

   Beginning with the story of Cain and Abel (

   ), favoritism plagues the subsequent generations (see Noah’s sons, 9:18–27; Isaac and Ishmael, 21:9–14; Joseph and his brothers,

   </i>
   Literally, “loved” (

    </b>
   </i>
   Rebekah’s love is left unexplained. Her favoritism of Jacob does not appear to depend on any self-gratification. Possibly her love serves as a compensation for Isaac’s preference of Esau, or perhaps is a response to Jacob’s nature as a “homespun man” who apparently stays close to home (v. 27). Her preference may also be related to how she interprets God’s words in
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G25-23">
    25:23
   </a>
   ; she favors the son she thinks has been selected by God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   There is only one other biblical narrative that mentions a woman’s love. In I Samuel 18, we read, “Michal, daughter of Saul, loved David” (I Samuel 18:20, 28). In both instances, the women eventually resort to deception to protect the one they love. (Michal rescues David from her father’s wrath and lies to her father about it; see I Samuel 19.) Love will soon spur Rebekah into deceiving Isaac in order to secure Jacob’s destiny (see
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_27.1-28.9">
    Genesis 27
   </a>
   ).

   Jacob’s manipulation of his short-sighted brother reflects poorly on both characters. Of the two, Jacob places value on what endures—a quality that may, in part, account for Rebekah’s machinations on his behalf. | Possessing the birthright, Jacob is now entitled to Isaac’s special blessings. The Hebrew term
   <i>
    b’chorah
   </i>
   (“birthright”) usually refers to the status of successor as head of the corporate household, which entails special economic and religious responsibilities as well as privileges. Normally in the ancient Near East, a first-born son possessed this status automatically, although he could barter it away or be stripped of it by the paterfamilias.
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_21.10-21">
    Deuteronomy 21:15–17
   </a>
   presumes that the first-born son receives a disproportionate share of the inheritance.

   he Torah repeatedly portrays Isaac as a passive figure; he is largely overshadowed by other members of his family. Only in this passage does Isaac appear as the chief actor. Even here, however, his father looms large. In all these episodes Isaac walks in his father’s footsteps, performing deeds similar to his father’s but with different results. First, God’s blessings are bestowed upon him due solely to his father’s merit. Second, his lie that Rebekah is his sister (repeating Abraham’s “wife-sister” deceptions in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    Genesis 12
   </a>
   and
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_21.8-21">
    21
   </a>
   ) backfires. Third, the wells he digs are repeatedly taken away (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_26.1-33">
    Genesis 26:15
   </a>
   ; contrast with Abraham who stands his ground in
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 21
   </a>
   ). And yet, Isaac gains a moral victory and comes away blessed (see
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G26-29">
    26:29
   </a>
   ). In this fashion, he represents another mode of Jewish survival: compliance rather than confrontation.

   Like his father (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G20-11">
    20:11
   </a>
   ), Isaac pretends—out of fear—that Rebekah is his sister in order to protect himself.

   The same description of Rebekah appears when the narrator introduces her in
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-15">
    24:16

   (translated there as “exceedingly beautiful”). Narrative sequence implies that this visit takes place decades later. Apparently Isaac still considers Rebekah alluringly beautiful.

   Sarah’s beauty prompted kings to take her to their palace (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#G12-14">
    12:14–15
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G20-1">
    20:2
   </a>
   ). However, in this episode, contrary to Isaac’s fears, no one takes Rebekah. Is it because she is not as attractive as Isaac supposes, or because King Abimelech learned his lesson with Abraham and Sarah? What follows indicates that Isaac continues to find his wife appealing and cannot keep himself away from her as time passes.

   In an ironic twist, Isaac is caught “playing” with his wife. The verb
   <i>
    m’tzachek
   </i>
   is a pun on his name,
   <i>
    Yitzchak.
   </i>
   Here the term connotes laughter and playfulness of the sort that spouses engage in. It is identical with the verb used of Ishmael with Isaac in
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G21-10">
    21:9

   Rebekah’s position is not compromised. Isaac’s wealth results from his efforts and from God’s blessings.

   Isaac’s peaceful disposition is apparent in the patience with which he digs and re-digs wells. When his ownership of wells is challenged, he relinquishes them, whereas Abraham had stood his ground (

   he marriage of Esau brings consternation to both his parents. In
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G28-1">
    27:46
   </a>
   , Rebekah claims that Esau’s marriages cause her despair. Isaac does nothing. One gathers that the fact the women are Canaanite is problematic (see at
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G28-1">
    28:1
   </a>
   ). Is this marriage one of the reasons why Rebekah chooses the drastic measures to pass the blessings to Jacob? Is it Isaac’s passivity in the face of what both consider a problem that moves her to take action?

   This name’s debut in Esau’s family is surprising in light of its subsequent use: The masculine form, Judah, will come to designate the main tribe in Israelite history, becoming the basis of the Hebrew word for “Jew.” (The enduring popularity among Jews of the name Judith comes from a different source: the heroic central character in an ancient Jewish post-biblical book of the same name.)

    Rebekah Ensures the Transmission of the Covenantal Blessings to Jacob

   ebekah appears to be in charge of the events in this episode, actively putting her plan into action. In order to implement what she understands as the divine plan, she must ensure that it is Jacob who receives the blessing from Isaac. Not being the head of the household, she lacks the authority to give Jacob the blessing directly. Rebekah thus works through Isaac, albeit without his explicit knowledge or consent. She creates a way to usurp his authority and use it for her own ends. If Rebekah had possessed the authority to work through the formal structures of inheritance, she would not have needed to use subterfuge and to pit brother against brother, son against father. Subterfuge is what women and men in positions of powerlessness, or of limited power, use to meet their rightful needs. See, for example, Tamar’s daring encounter with Judah (
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
    Genesis 38
   </a>
   ), and young David’s deception of King Achish (I Samuel 21:11–16). Because women generally lack certain authority in biblical narrative, they sometimes work out unusual tactics to resolve problems and achieve results. They take on the daring plots that dramatically alter the course of events. In biblical narratives, their acts are usually recognized as beneficial: lives are saved, the right side wins, the right son inherits, the family line continues.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Although the rabbinic sages primarily praise Rebekah for her actions, modern biblical scholars are more mixed in their readings of her actions. Some see her as a laudable trickster who must use stratagems to bend the male power structure to her purpose. Others see her as a manipulating schemer whose actions here fit into stereotyped expectations of female behavior, and who is punished for her behavior by never seeing her favorite child again. Adrien Bledstein offers an alternate reading of the episode, suggesting that Isaac is in fact the trickster: he is not deceived by Rebekah but rather has her do his dirty work for him (“Binder, Trickster, Heel…1993). (For a range of opinions on Rebekah, see Beilis,

   In contrast to Esau, Jacob is referred to several times as “her son” (see also v. 17). The language used here seems to exclude Esau from the kind of close relationship that Jacob has with Rebekah.

  <div class="tab-en1">

    </b>
   </i>
   In this chapter Isaac is never referred to in relation to Rebekah; he is called “father” (vv. 6, 9, 10, 14), but not Rebekah’s husband. Isaac’s importance to Rebekah seems to recede into the background, and her most primary relationship is with Jacob her son. Rebekah and Isaac converse only at the very end of the tale, when Rebekah intervenes (again) for Jacob’s sake (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G28-1">
    27:46
   </a>
   ). While Isaac is reported to have loved Rebekah upon seeing her (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G24-67">
    24:67
   </a>
   ), the narrative never states that Rebekah returns this love. The language in this section of the text connects her directly to her son Jacob, but not to Isaac.

   Rebekah will tell Jacob twice more to listen to her (vv. 13 and 43). She repeats herself to make sure that she has his attention. Carol Meyers notes that
   <i>
    authority
   </i>
   is the ability to control situations and decision-making through official channels and systems, whereas
   <i>
    power
   </i>
   involves doing so through more informal and unofficial avenues
   <i>
    (Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Women in Context,
   </i>
   1988, p. 41). Here, Rebekah does not have the proper authority, but she has power. She cannot formally bestow the blessing upon Jacob, but she can ensure he listens to her.

   In going along with Rebekah’s plan, Jacob knowingly takes on the role of trickster vis-à-vis Isaac; in the process, Jacob learns from his mother how to achieve a goal by the use of subterfuge. Later, he himself will be tricked by Laban, his father-in-law, who will again use the ploy of covering up the truth to manipulate Jacob into marrying not his beloved Rachel, but her sister Leah (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#G27-25">
    29:25
   </a>
   ). In turn, Jacob will refine his trickster status by convincing Laban to agree to an arrangement by which Jacob will depart with a significant percentage of Laban’s flock (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.31-30.24">
    Genesis 30

   </i>
   Rebekah assures Jacob that if anyone is blamed or punished for what he is about to do, it will be she and not he. Her readiness to take responsibility can be seen as her understanding that what she is doing is not deception for personal gain, but the fulfillment of God’s plan as revealed to her during her pregnancy (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G25-23">
    25:23

   ). The deception they are about to carry out is for the greater good, a case of “the ends justifies the means.”

   </i>
   Images of domesticity fill Rebekah’s story. As Carol Meyers notes, women in ancient Israel held major roles within the household. They had the primary responsibility for educating the young as well as for transforming unprocessed ingredients into cooked, consumable food (
   <i>
    Discovering Eve,
   </i>
   1988, pp. 145–146). Rebekah moves confidently throughout her family’s domain. She is in control of its clothing and of the preparation of its food. She decides when its livestock is to be slaughtered. Her tools for survival are the items immediately and easily available to her. Such things mark this as a woman’s story.

   The covering up of Jacob is the central element of Rebekah’s act of subterfuge. Like Tamar in
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#ge_38.1-30">
    Genesis 38
   </a>
   , who covers herself with a veil, Rebekah can be successful only through the act of covering up, not by acting directly and out in the open.

    </b>
   </i>
   As with the clothing in v. 15, Rebekah uses what is on hand in the female sphere. The seemingly harmless domestic items of food or bread become the tools she uses to influence the course of events. The verse is clear that these are items whose preparation Rebekah has personally directed (and perhaps has undertaken herself), emphasizing her purposefulness in executing the plan.

   JACOB STEALS ESAU’S BLESSING (27:18–29)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The climax of this episode occurs when Jacob goes to Isaac posing as Esau and receives the blessing intended for his brother. In a dramatic scene between father and son, Isaac asks several times for reassurance that this is indeed Esau before him. Isaac, who cannot see well, uses all his other senses in trying to make sure this is the right son: he touches Jacob (vv. 22, 26), he listens to his voice (v. 22), he tastes his food (v. 25), and he smells him (v. 27). Isaac’s blessing of Jacob in this scene establishes Jacob as the heir to the covenantal promises. Although Isaac is depicted as a weak and passive dupe, the overly exaggerated and repetitive details presented here beg the question of how complicit Isaac is in the ruse.

   Isaac asks the critical question. Rebekah has worked hard to cover up Jacob’s identity, dressing him in Esau’s clothes and putting in his hands the food made under her supervision (vv. 15–17).

    </b>
   </i>
   Isaac is not only physically blind, but on a deeper level he refuses to recognize what would be clear to any parent. Can his knowledge of his children truly be so superficial that he can only distinguish between them visually? His question indicates doubt, yet he seems to want to believe this son before him.

   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_27.1-28.9">

   For the third time, Isaac wants to make sure this is the right son. Is he really being fooled by the costume, as he was fooled by the food in the previous verse, or is he willingly allowing himself to be led through a charade? Perhaps Isaac is allowing himself to be misled; he is blind to what he chooses not to see.

  <div class="tab-en1">
   The manner in which the story is narrated up to this moment leaves open the possibility that Isaac not only knows that Jacob has the qualities needed for proceeding with the covenantal plan but also lets Rebekah arrange for Jacob to received his blessing. He could, however, be genuinely deceived.

   Rebekah addresses her words to Isaac, providing a reason to for him to send Jacob away. This way, Jacob is able to leave with Isaac’s blessing and permission. Once again, Rebekah has created a situation in which it seems that Isaac is in control, while she pulls the strings. She has done what had to be done, but now her beloved Jacob will be gone.

   As the people of Israel formulates its own identity in tension with surrounding cultures, its traditions frequently express anxiety about Israelite men marrying Canaanite women. Thus with regard to Isaac,
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_24.1-67">
    Genesis 24
   </a>
   strongly advocated endogamy—that is, marriage within the family’s kinship group. In this parashah, Esau’s marriage to Canaanite women upsets his parents (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_26.34-35">
    26:35

   ). The concern seems less when the foreign woman comes from a non-Canaanite family (see, for example,
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_21.10-21">

    N THIS TORAH PORTION
   </small>
   , our foremother Rebekah takes matters into her own hands in order to secure Isaac’s blessing for her favorite son, Jacob. She is encouraged to do so by the prophecy she receives when she inquires of God during her pregnancy (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G25-23">
    25:23
   </a>
   ). God answers Rebekah’s inquiry about her pregnancy with the ambiguity inherent in every oracle. The oracle specifies that Rebekah is carrying twins and that each child will develop into a nation. Their future relationships, however, remain ambiguous (see at v. 23). Which of the two peoples shall overcome the other? Who will serve whom?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   What if Rebekah misinterprets the prophecy? What if its ambiguity is part of the divine purpose? What if, by eliminating the ambiguity—by urging Jacob to steal the blessing meant for his brother—Rebekah is not acting in harmony with the will of God?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In that case we would expect the text to show dire consequences. Indeed, such consequences ensue. First, the fruits of the stolen blessing do not come easily to Jacob. The blessing that he gains by guile refers to material benefits (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G27-28">
    27:28–29
   </a>
   ). He later secures his wealth—the promise in this stolen blessing—in an environment of stealth (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.31-30.24">
    Genesis 29–31
   </a>
   ). Second, he soon loses something far more precious than material abundance: his beloved wife dies in childbirth (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#g35-16">
    35:19
   </a>
   ). Third, there is consequently Rebekah’s pain. She sends Jacob away for his protection (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G27-42">
    27:43–44
   </a>
   ) and dies without seeing him again. Rebekah must have suffered deeply in separating from her beloved son Jacob. She pays a very high price for her determination to ignore the ambiguity of God’s word.

   The outcome of Rebekah’s story may, perhaps, teach us to allow the divine process to unfold for a while, before we decide to take action on God’s behalf. Perhaps the gift from our biblical mother Rebekah in this parashah is her prompting us to sense ambiguity, to appreciate nuance—and to have the wisdom and patience to let divine intention blossom in its own time.

    parashat Tol’dot
   </i>
   the reader is re-introduced to Rebekah, the second of the matriarchs, whom the Rabbis extolled for resisting the temptations of idolatry and unrighteous behavior that characterized her childhood home. Moreover, when God’s intention to maintain the covenant through Jacob was made known to her, she single-mindedly fulfilled the divine will, even when it meant deceiving her husband and disinheriting her older son. The Rabbis’ high regard for her reminds us that this portion is as much about Rebekah as it is about her husband. According to the Rabbis, her virtuous behavior merited that the twelve tribes would spring directly from her through her son Jacob (Midrash
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   63.6).

   (

    25:20
   </a>
   ). This verse describes Rebekah as the daughter of Bethuel “the Aramean,” of Paddan Aram, and as the sister of Laban “the Aramean.” Given the name of the city, both
   <a id="page_151">
   </a>
   mentions of “the Aramean” (
   <i>

   </i>
   ) appear superfluous. By means of word play,
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   63.4 explains that the first “Aramean” comes to teach us that her father was a
   <i>
    ram’ai
   </i>
   —a deceiver. Her brother was also a deceiver, as were all her neighbors. Rebekah was surrounded by deception, living among bad influences on her behavior. But she set herself apart and stood out like “a lily among the thorns” (Song of Songs 2:2).

   ). According to rabbinic tradition, there were seven infertile biblical women for whom prayer was efficacious.
   <i>
    P’sikta D’Rav Kahana
   </i>
   20.1 lists the first six as Sarah, Rebekah, Leah, Rachel, the wife of Manoah (Samson’s mother in Judges 13), and Hannah. The seventh is personified Israel, based on the characterization of Zion as a childless woman whose hopes for offspring will be fulfilled by God at the time of redemption (Isaiah 54).

   </a>
   ).
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   63.6 relates that whenever Rebekah stood near synagogues or schools, Jacob struggled to come out; and when she passed idolatrous temples, Esau eagerly endeavored to emerge.

  <div class="tab-en1">

    </b>
   </i>
   (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G25-23">
    25:22
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis dignified both Sarah and Rebekah with the title of prophet. They further observed that Rebekah experienced divine revelation twice, once when God informed her that she was pregnant with twins, and again when Rebekah learned about Esau’s decision to kill Jacob (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G27-42">
    27:42
   </a>
   ). In the first instance, she learns of the two nations struggling in her womb when she visits the study house of Shem and Eber (see
   <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_11.10-26">
    Genesis 11:10–26
   </a>
   ;
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   63.6). Here, the Rabbis reaffirmed the need for intercession between the Divine and humans, a notion found also in
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   82.3 with reference to Jacob. Thus gender does not seem to be the issue as much as the notion of how one makes contact with God. Similarly, in the second case, the Rabbis stated that the matriarchs were prophets—and Rebekah was a matriarch. Thus, despite her less than reputable pedigree, Rebekah joins her husband in meriting prophetic status; in fact, it is Rebekah rather than Isaac who executes the divine will in ensuring that Jacob receive the status of first-born son (
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah

   63.7; 67.9).

   </i>
   (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_25.27-34">
    25:28
   </a>
   ). According to
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   63.10, “The more she heard his voice [engaged in study, reciting his lessons aloud], the stronger grew her love for him.”
  </div>

    <b>

   </i>
   (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_26.34-35">
    26:34–35
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis invoked Rebekah’s idolatrous pedigree when they considered this reference to Isaac’s and Rebekah’s unhappiness over Esau’s choice of wives. They concluded that Isaac is mentioned first in this verse because he was far more disturbed over Esau’s marriages to idolators than Rebekah. This is because, “as the daughter of idolatrous priests, Rebekah was more accustomed to the pollution of idolatry and did not object—but Isaac, the son of holy parents, did object” (
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   65.4). The Rabbis were also struck by the focus on Isaac in a passage concerned with domestic matters. Ordinarily one would have expected Rebekah to be more aware of what went on in her household than her husband. The Rabbis extrapolated this assumption to women in general, positing “another reason why Isaac is mentioned first: It is a woman’s habit to stay at home [and do productive work], and a man’s to go out in public and learn understanding from people; but as Isaac’s eyes were dim he stayed at home; therefore [the matter was disturbing] to Isaac first” (
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah

   65.4).

    HIS TORAH PORTION PRESENTS
   </small>
   the second of three matriarchs who suffer barrenness. In this episode Rebekah and Isaac are unable to conceive for the first twenty years of their marriage (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_25.19-26">
    25:20
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G25-26">
    26
   </a>
   ). The Torah uses barren couples as a literary device to demonstrate the miraculous nature of the conception of the patriarchs and the beneficence of God. Infertility in the twenty-first century tells a different story: overworked and overstressed women, late marriage, and perhaps environmental toxins that inhibit reproduction.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The economy and culture of Rebekah’s Canaan and our society are worlds apart, yet the emotional reaction to infertility has remained largely unchanged. While suffering from her difficult pregnancy, Rebekah cries out,
   <i>
    “Im ken lamah zeh anochi?
   </i>
   (If this is so, why do I exist?)” Rebekah herself utters these words after she becomes pregnant. But many Jews ask such a question earlier, when they face difficulty conceiving and bringing a pregnancy to term. Aspiring parents today often suffer a crisis of meaning. Women and men who face infertility may experience devastating depression, anger, jealousy, and deep existential angst. It might seem that feminism would have liberated women from expectations of motherhood. After all, feminists of our age take pride that we are not limited by the narrow definitions of womanhood that characterized Rebekah’s milieu. Yet even in our liberated modern age, women and men usually see biological parenthood as a necessary rite of passage without which they are not considered full adults. Generating a child is a signifier of “true womanhood” and “real manhood” to many. Barrenness remains a social stigma—particularly in the Jewish community, which holds that the first
   <i>
    mitzvah
   </i>
   in the Torah is
   <i>
    p’ru u-rvu
   </i>
   (be fruitful and multiply).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Full integration and acceptance in the Jewish community often revolve around family life. The Jewish community has grown more open to gay and lesbian families in recent years largely because many such couples have been able to become parents—some through adoption or prior heterosexual reproduction, and more recently through artificial insemination. Yet adults in their thirties, forties, and fifties without children—regardless of their marital status and sexual orientation—remain outsiders in all but the most avant-garde synagogues and activist Jewish organizations. Childless adults treated as full participants in Jewish life remain the exception, and thus the Jewish community tends to lose these people from the rolls of temple membership.

   What of the Jewish championing of classic feminist ideas that a woman is much more than a baby machine; that anatomy is not destiny; that a woman defines herself not primarily through her family but through her deeds and ideas? Even today, motherhood and fatherhood in the Jewish community are both idealized and romanticized. Now as much as ever, family and parenthood are the primary cultural institution where individuals look to find personal fulfillment, happiness, and love. Most contemporary Jews cannot imagine finding such rewards without children; many find it difficult to consider doing so without their own genetic children to realize the wish to pass Judaism, love, and genes
   <i>

   </i>
   (from generation to generation).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Our community has done only an adequate job providing support for the infertile. Chapters on infertility in mainstream Jewish parenting books remain either absent or in the non-normative category even though infertility is rife. Nina Beth Cardin has written
   <i>
    Tears of Sorrow, Seeds of Hope
   </i>
   (second edition, 2007), a spiritual
   <a id="page_153">
   </a>
   companion for those grieving infertility, pregnancy loss, or stillbirth. This book belongs in every Jewish library, and in time, its messages will perhaps pervade Jewish culture. Yet even in this book adoption is discussed only as a last and unfavorable alternative.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Meanwhile, responsa literature and halachic interpretations have strongly supported artificial insemination and
   <i>
    in vitro
   </i>
   fertilization for heterosexual couples facing infertility because of the strong drive for Jewish continuity. Such a notion of Jewish continuity is not only religious, but also biological. There is more support in the Jewish institutional world than in Christian communities for reproductive technologies, apparently because many Jews believe Judaism is inherited as much as taught.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The definition of family in the Jewish world, it seems, clings to a model of parents who have genetic offspring. For example, in a study reported in 1991, researchers who surveyed a sample of male college students found that the Jews considered it more important than did the Christians that children be conceived by themselves and their spouse, rather than adopted.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Bonnie Ellen Baron and Lawrence Baron refer to that survey in the ground-breaking book
   <i>
    Lifecycles,
   </i>
   edited by Rabbi Debra Orenstein (1994). In their article “On Adoption” they explain that while there are some biblical precedents for adoption (Mordecai was guardian of Esther; Sarah initially seeks to adopt Hagar’s son), Judaism never has strongly encouraged it. They speculate that “Jewish law lacks a formal procedure for adoption because of the primacy it accords biological kinship in determining a child’s inheritance rights and religious and tribal status” (p. 28). This is true in spite of the primacy of
   <i>
    tikkun olam
   </i>
   as a deeply embedded value among Jews. How can we identify ourselves as a community of
   <i>
    tikkun
   </i>
   (repair) without a commitment to adopt children who languish around the world without loving parents?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Adoption support is rarely modeled by Jewish leaders. A remarkable exception is Yosef Abramowitz and Rabbi Susan Silverman, a couple who direct Jewish Family and Life! and began a family with biological offspring but also fulfilled a dream to adopt two children born in Ethiopia.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   <i>
    “Im ken Lamah zeh anochi?
   </i>
   (If this is so, why do I exist?)” was Rebekah’s question that continues to bedevil Jewish adults who hope to parent but are unable to carry a pregnancy to term. Has feminism not brought us better questions and better answers? Have modern, forward-thinking Jewish communities failed to provide real alternatives to a dilemma of meaninglessness in the absence of genetic heirs?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   <i>

   poses the question of meaning. If we answer that we exist only to fulfill impulses through our children, we have failed Judaism and feminism. If we answer that we exist for
   <i>

   to nurture children—biological, adoptive, and those we teach, mentor and support—then we will have succeeded far more in realizing the sacred goal of
