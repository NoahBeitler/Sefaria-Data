   (“Go forth!”) is about relationships: relationships between God and Israel, relationships among the Israelites, and relationships between Israelites and non-Israelites. The question “Who are we?”—which the first part of Genesis answered in universal terms—now begins to be explored by focusing on one family, the subject of the rest of the Torah.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The ideas are expressed in traditional biblical forms, such as scenes of covenant-making (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_15.1-21">
    Genesis 15
   </a>
   and
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
    17
   </a>
   ); the annunciation to the mother of a future hero (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    Genesis 16
   </a>
   ); and the story of the patriarch who tells the foreign ruler that his wife is his sister (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.10-14.24">
    12:10–13
   </a>
   ; a version of such a story recurs in
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 20:1–18
   </a>
   and again in
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_26.1-33">
    26:1–16
   </a>
   ). All of these tales contribute to Israelite “founding myths,” that is, stories of the people’s origins, and to the process of self-definition.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   As for its gender orientation, on one hand this parashah seems strongly androcentric. Divine conversation is primarily with Abraham, the patriarch. He is the party to the important scenes of covenant-making so central to the people’s identity. Only males can undergo circumcision, the sign of the covenant with God. Much of the parashah’s interest is in the birth of male children who will carry on the line of the patriarch and fulfill divine promises.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   On the other hand, the women featured in this parashah, Sarah and Hagar, exhibit a power in the household that is also critical to the identity and development of the people. It is the barren woman—Sarah—who must bear the child in Abraham’s line. The difficulty with which such women conceive further marks their sons’ importance. Sarah is Abraham’s co-trickster in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    Genesis 12
   </a>
   , where he enlists her help in deceiving Pharaoh, thereby saving his life and improving his lot. Sarah, like Abraham, undergoes a name change marking her participation in God’s covenant.

   Women are portrayed as essential for men’s livelihood and for procreation, and also as keepers of their children’s futures. To be sure, such roles are circumscribed and betoken a world politically dominated by men, but women do have important roles to play within the contours of this system. The tale of Hagar in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    Genesis 16
   </a>
   is particularly interesting in this respect. (On women’s role in the covenant with God, see also

   begins with a transformation in identity and status through a physical, geographical passage. Abraham, here called Abram, is instructed by God to leave the land of his birth and go to the land God shows him (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    12:1
   </a>
   ). Two other key players in this early Israelite foundation myth, who like Abram were introduced at the end of the previous parashah, are Sarah (Sarai), who is married to Abraham, and Lot, their nephew (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    12:4
   </a>
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    5
   </a>
   ). The Deity establishes a relationship with the patriarch through blessings, grounded in covenantal promises of land and descendants (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    12:1–2
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g12-7">
    7
   </a>
   ). God’s words demarcate who is inside the group versus outside (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    12:3
   </a>
   ), as Abraham and his household are pictured wandering and migrating, stopping to set up key markers of presence and possession: the altars that link Abraham and his descendants with God (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g12-7">
    12:7
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g12-7">
    8
   </a>
   ). Critical aspects of Israelite identity thus emerge from this initial sketch. God reaches out to Abraham, who in turn reaches out to God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Abraham is treated as the blessed founding father of subsequent generations. Divine blessings are also possible for non-kin who may be “blessed in/by” Abraham (v. 3). A modern appropriator might consider the notion of being blessed through Abraham to be universalistic, perhaps referring to the ethos modeled by Abraham’s life. Within its ancient Israelite setting, however, the phrase more likely affirmed the centrality and importance of Abraham as founder of Israel, covenant partner of God. As portrayed in Genesis, he is the mediator par excellence.

   These opening verses of this critical passage are rhythmic and rhyming, with repetition on the second person. The words catch the eye and ear as demarcating an important beginning.

   Blessing and curse depend upon regard for Abraham and his descendants. One thinks also of late-biblical works that imagine an ingathering to Jerusalem at the end-time, or an attempt by foreigners to latch onto Jews as a means of reaching salvation (as in Zechariah 8:20–23). The founding myth dealing with Abraham is thus perceived to have cosmic significance, but the message is meant less to encourage or convert foreigners than to assure the group of its own importance.

   In this Israelite self-portrayal, the ancestors are pictured as a family group of marginal wanderers from “elsewhere” who travel in response to a divine command and who are not native to the land. Upon arrival, Abram’s first act is to build an altar.

   The name means “Princess,” a variant of Sarah. It has been proposed that the name reflects her high status (see at

   Located forty miles north of Jerusalem, the city is later associated with covenant renewal in Joshua 24. However, it will also be the place of the so-called rape of Dinah (see
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
    Genesis 34
   </a>
   ). Originally Shechem was a sacred city to the Canaanites. Sacred groves were an important feature of cultic sites (note the tree under which Deborah sits in Judges 4:5). Here the “oak of
   <i>
    moreh”
   </i>
   (literally, the tree “of the teacher”) is apparently a divinatory site where humans gain knowledge with help from the divine. Abraham is thus portrayed as establishing an altar at this ancient sacred space where people encountered God at a time long before Israelite kings, priests, and the great temple in Jerusalem.

     The whole land lies before you! Pray part from me: if [you] go north, I will turn south; and if [you] go south, I will turn north.”

   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G20-1">
    20:1–18
   </a>
   ; Isaac and Rebekah in 26:1–16). The deception leads to an improvement in the tricksters’ status, but the deception is uncovered and they are summarily dismissed. They depart, however, with their newly acquired goods intact. The tale portrays Pharaoh as a dupe and deals with the “us-them” theme in a humorous and thoroughly traditional way.

   This passage is not a tale about unethical behavior, but a story of marginalized persons who succeed in roundabout, unorthodox ways. In both such stories that involve Abraham and Sarah, Sarah proves to be the reason for Abraham’s increased wealth.

   The biblical writer provides a reason for Pharaoh’s interest in Sarai. While the Song of Songs is rich in poetic expressions of admiration for the lover’s physical beauty, such overt observations about characters’ beauty are limited and terse in the rest of the Bible. Their presence calls special attention to the relationship between the husband and wife.

   Pharaoh, the despot, has no right simply to steal a man’s wife if the woman pleases him, as he himself realizes (v. 18). Abram, as “brother,” is treated as the man in charge of Sarai’s sexuality. (Typically in the ancient Near East, a woman’s reproductive capacity was controlled by a particular man, whether father, brother, or husband.) Here as in the Dinah story (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
    Genesis 34
   </a>
   ), a special role is envisioned for a “brother.”

In this literary form, God appears or speaks; the recipient of the message is promised blessings of land and progeny; the Deity self-identifies; and a sign is provided to mark and seal the relationship. Of special note in this scene are the name of the Deity (v. 7); the ritual (vv. 9–17); the prophecy offered (vv. 13–16); and the lack of explicit conditions laid upon the patriarch as covenant partner.

   Abram confronts God, calling attention to the grand yet unfulfilled promises of progeny. Abram has not resorted to the variety of customs in ancient times that enabled householders to ensure their posterity (such as taking an additional wife). See at

   In Hebrew idiom, to make a covenant is literally to “cut” one. Drawing parallels with ancient Near Eastern custom and Jeremiah 34:17–22, scholars have suggested that the division of the animal is an implied threat, symbolizing the result of a failure to keep the covenant. An alternate view is that the covenant’s parties belong to one unit, one body; each half is incomplete without its counterpart. Bonds are affirmed through participation in sacrificial ritual—in a common mode of cultural expression.

   his passages returns to a problem mentioned earlier (
   <a href="05_chapter_02.xhtml#ge_11.27-32">
    11:30
   </a>
   ): the barrenness of the patriarch’s wife. That topic is a recurring motif foreshadowing the birth of a hero (see the story of Hannah, mother of Samuel, in I Samuel 1–2). Here, Sarai takes matters into her own hands by giving her husband her female slave as wife. The slave’s children will belong to her mistress by adoption. The passage reveals the ethical and practical difficulties of this sort of surrogate motherhood, and the political dimensions of reproduction in a traditional patrilineal society. Nevertheless, in a world in which having children is a major source of status, Hagar is emboldened by her pregnancy (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    16:4
   </a>
   ). Sarai “treat(s) her harshly,” and the girl runs away. The annunciation that follows is a traditional marker of the biography of a hero. Here, as in
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 21
   </a>
   , the reader briefly feels immersed in a non-Israelite nation’s founding myth.

  <div class="head2" id="ge_vv.1-6">
   BARRENNESS AND SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD (16:1–6)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The theme of the barren wife recurs throughout tales of the matriarchs and of the mothers of other heroes—including Rebekah, Rachel, Samson’s unnamed mother, and Hannah. The motif implies that a boy born under such circumstances is truly sent by God, his mother’s condition having received special attention by the Deity. In the Bible, reproductive problems typically concern women, whereas in other traditions either parent may be regarded as infertile. This is another of the Bible’s double-edged swords regarding the status of women. On the one hand, to be infertile is to be marginal, possibly afflicted by God; on the other hand, annunciations of a child’s birth account for most of the few biblical passages in which God communicates with and empowers women. Here the biblical writers deftly draw out the ways in which children connote status in this society. Implicitly, they also point to the powerlessness of slave women whose reproductive capacity belongs to another. Both women—mistress and slave—have their options expanded and yet are also constrained by their cultural roles.

    </b>
   </i>
   Hebrew has several terms for female servants or slaves. The term here refers to the lowest level of servitude. Slavery was an accepted part of ancient Near Eastern cultures, Israel included. Although certain biblical laws ameliorate the plight of slaves, especially male Hebrews (see at
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 21:2–11
   </a>
   and
   <a href="35_chapter_32.xhtml#levi_25.8-54">
    Leviticus 25:35–54
   </a>
   ), they do not overtly oppose the institution. According to the Sinai covenant, a daughter sold into slavery was normally not released in the seventh year (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 21:2
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    7
   </a>
   ). In addition to the usual hardships that they shared with male counterparts, women slaves were also used by males in the household for sexual or procreative purposes. Typically, their masters or mistresses had extensive control over their fate. In the story of Rachel and Leah, their father Laban gives a woman slave to each of his daughters (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.1-30">
    Genesis 29:24
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.1-30">
    29
   </a>
   ); in turn, they assign those slaves—named Zilpah and Bilhah—to their husband, Jacob, in order to produce children (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.1-30">
    Genesis 29–30
   </a>
   ). Here, when Hagar becomes Abram’s wife (v. 3), she does not cease to be Sarai’s slave; when Abraham surrenders Hagar to Sarai’s authority (v. 6), he acknowledges that his wife has prior claims that supersede his. (In
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_25.1-18">
    Genesis 25:6
   </a>
   , Hagar appears to be counted among Abraham’s concubines—a status higher than that of a slave but lower than a wife.)

   Sarai acknowledges that fertility is ultimately in the hands of the Deity (see
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_29.31-30.24">
    Genesis 30:2
   </a>
   ), but nevertheless takes matters into her own hands.

      “maybe I will have a son through her.”
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The Hebrew is more ambiguous since the word “son” does not appear. Instead, Sarai is using a verb that can mean either “I will have a child” or “I will be built”—that is, established—which refers to creating a family and continuity with no reference to the offspring’s gender. | Sarai’s motive is not clear. Is it to ensure her own position, to fulfill Abram’s dream of having a child as an heir (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_15.1-21">
    Genesis 15:2–3
   </a>
   ), or both? | Modern scholars have long pointed to extra-biblical evidence for varieties of surrogate motherhood in the ancient Near East, such as was regulated in the Laws of Hammurabi (¶ 146). Sarai participates in an unspecified version of that widely practiced system and seeks to be empowered within its contours.

   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_21.8-21">
    Genesis 21:12
   </a>
   , God will need to explicitly instruct Abraham to obey Sarah: “Do whatever Sarah tells you”—more literally “All that Sarah tells you, heed her voice.” Here, however, Abram shows no reluctance to follow his wife’s instructions. In household matters, women exercised authority.

   The biblical writers are psychologically astute in describing the tension between husband and wife over difficult reproductive issues (see also

   The principal wife clearly has certain rights in these situations involving reproduction, as Abram—unquestioning—implicitly recognizes. From a much later Jewish community in Egypt (5th century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   ) we have a document in which one man’s slave becomes another’s wife, and another document in which her master frees her. Such conflicting lines of authority create complexities of which the stories here and in
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 21
   </a>
   are a dramatic, even tragic, example. Meanwhile, from a literary perspective, one observes Abram’s frustration and feelings of powerlessness, as well as his desire not to become involved in this world of women.

   To be equated with a virile strong male animal is usually a positive metaphor in the ancient Near East (see the references to the bull and the wild-ox in
   <a href="57_chapter_54.xhtml#deu_33.1-29">
    Deuteronomy 33:17
   </a>
   ). The rest of the blessing should likewise be construed as positive, although this translator understood it differently.

   Literally, “the well of the living one of my seeing.” The naming of a place after a theophany is a common biblical motif (cf. 28:19). However, Hagar is the only woman whose experience is enshrined in a place name. None of the matriarchs receive this honor. Such a privilege for the marginalized slave-woman—the outsider—is striking; the narrative views Hagar with sympathy and as having value.

   he Abrahamic covenant (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_15.1-21">
    Genesis 15

   ) is now sealed by the rite of circumcision. The incising of the covenant on male bodies is a critical feature of Israelite self-identification and may perhaps be linked with the importance of male lineages in this ancient culture.

   Five times in this passage, God refers to the covenant’s other party as “you and your descendants” (literally “seed”); this indicates that membership in the covenant is not limited to males, although every male is to bear circumcision as a mark of the covenant. This covenant is with Abraham and Sarah’s offspring regardless of gender. Likewise the entire Israelite people is a party to the Covenant at Sinai, where Shabbat—not circumcision—is the covenantal

   REITERATION OF PROMISES OF A CHILD BY SARAH (17:15–22)

   God’s power over life is emphasized by the divine capacity to allow a ninety-year-old woman to bear a child. God’s blessing of Sarah parallels that of Abraham, since both will be parents of many significant descendants. However, there are two striking differences. First, the promise is addressed directly to Abraham and not to Sarah. Second, only Sarah’s son is the legitimate heir of the covenant, not any of Abraham’s other sons. (See
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_25.1-18">

   So that “it may go well for” him in Egypt, Abram asks Sarai to say she is his sister, and so the wife is taken into Pharaoh’s house (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    Genesis 12
   </a>
   ). So that she may “have a son [or: child] through her” (

  <div class="tab-en1">
   Like Sarai, the Egyptian Hagar—whose name echoes the word
   <i>

   (“stranger”)—is taken from her home to Canaan. This cycle of displacement and enslavement will continue: Hagar’s descendants (the Ishmaelites) will sell Joseph into Egyptian slavery (
   <a href="12_chapter_09.xhtml#g37-27">
    37:27–28

   ), and Hoar’s people (the Egyptians) will “afflict” Sarah’s descendants (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#exo_1.1-22">
    Exodus 1:11–12
   </a>
   ) as Sarah “afflicted” Hagar (

   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    16:2
   </a>
   ), the post-menopausal Sarai “became light” (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    16:4
   </a>
   ) in the slave’s eyes; Hagar grows weightier—both physically through pregnancy and emotionally as she recognizes her opportunity for advancement in Abram’s household.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Abused by Sarai and ignored by Abram, Hagar flees to the wilderness. There an angel attends not to the Hebrew patriarch, but to the Egyptian slave: although sent back to her mistress, Hagar goes with the knowledge that “
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   has heard (
   <i>

   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Similarly, Sarai herself—a foreign female trapped (enslaved?) in Pharaoh’s house—receives divine aid. Her parallels to Hagar suggest that God acts not simply “because of Sarai” but specifically “upon Sarai’s word” (
   <i>
    al d’var Sarai,

   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#G12-14">

  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   We later learn that the sons of Sarai and Hagar, although destined to be at odds (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g16-11">

   </a>
   ), unite to bury their father (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#G25-9">

   39.14, Sarah was an active agent of God’s work in the world even when she and Abraham were still in Haran. Commenting on the literal sense, Rabbi Eleazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosi ben Zimra: “If all the inhabitants of the world got together to create [a living being], they would be unable to animate even a mosquito, but the Torah says
   <i>
    the people they had made
   </i>
   ! These are the proselytes they converted.” [The Midrash then asks:] If the verse refers to conversion, why does it employ the verb “made”? To teach you that when a person converts another, it is as if the one created the other. [The Midrash then points out a problem:] It should say,
   <i>
    he had made

   —why does it say,
   <i>

   41.2 imagines that when Sarai was trapped in Pharaoh’s house, she prostrated herself “and said, ‘Ruler of the Universe, Abram left [Haran] on the strength of promises, and I left on the strength of my faith. Now, Abram is outside this prison and I am inside!’ The blessed Holy One said, ‘All that I do, I do for you.’” This midrash suggests that Sarai’s belief that she would share in Abram’s blessings was called into question when she was trapped in Pharaoh’s house while Abram walked free; however, she is reassured that it is precisely
   <i>
    because of Sarai, Abram’s wife,
   </i>
   that Pharaoh is punished. Even more remarkably, Sarai reminds God that her willingness to leave Haran for an unknown destination is more praiseworthy than Abram’s precisely because God has promised her nothing. Sarai serves here as a paradigm of a faithful follower of God, one who responds to God’s call without the promise of reward.

   (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    16:1
   </a>
   ). The Rabbis gave Hagar an exalted lineage, identifying her as the daughter of Pharaoh. This tradition underscores Sarai’s piety since it claims that when Pharaoh sees the wonders performed on her behalf, he exclaims, “Better my daughter be a servant in this household than mistress in another”; and later on, Sarai gives Hagar to Abram as a second wife, not as a concubine (
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   45.1). She also encourages Hagar to have sexual relations with Abram by emphasizing her husband’s holiness (
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   45.3). According to
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   45.2, Sarai’s decision that Abram should take Hagar as a wife is seen as an instance of her prophetic powers.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Still, the Rabbis are troubled by both Hagar’s and Sarah’s behavior.
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   45.4 relates that once Hagar became pregnant, she told other women that Sarah was clearly not the righteous woman she pretended to be, as evidenced by her infertility. Sarah, in turn, is criticized for harassing Hagar and for forcing Abraham to mediate between his wife and the mother of his unborn child (
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   45.5–6). While Hagar is criticized for treating her mistress disrespectfully, she is also worthy of divine protection. Five of God’s messengers appear to Hagar as she flees Sarah’s anger (
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   45.7). In naming God as the

   (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g16-13">

   the
   <i>

   (the covenant) that God establishes with Abraham? While our impulse might well be: “How can you ask such a question?
   <i>
    Of course
   </i>
   Sarah was part of the covenant,” the details of the text force the question upon us. From the opening words calling Abraham to leave his homeland, and throughout this parashah, God speaks directly with Abraham, not with Sarah. Most dramatically, the sign of the
   <i>
    b’rit
   </i>
   in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
    Genesis 17
   </a>
   is circumcision, clearly a male-only ritual.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   One could argue that this ritual established a covenant only between God and Abraham, and Abraham’s male descendants, and that women stood outside this religious cult altogether. Perhaps Sarah and the other matriarchs had their own religious practices and traditions, their own way of relating to God. Or, perhaps, they were passive members of this covenant between God and the men, valued as child-bearers, but otherwise on the periphery.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Let us consider another way to read the text. The critical element of the
   <i>
    b’rit
   </i>
   is the promise that Abraham will be fruitful and become the father of nations. Women’s role as childbearers is therefore not ancillary but central to meaning of the covenant. And, while God does not address Sarah directly in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
    Genesis 17
   </a>
   , God refers to her and changes Sarah’s name just like Abraham’s—with the addition of the letter
   <i>
    heh
   </i>
   and with a parallel explanation: “she shall give rise to nations; rulers of peoples shall issue from her” (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g17-15">
    17:16
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Even when Abraham doubts Sarah’s ability to bear children and suggests that God’s covenant continue through Ishmael, God reassures him that the covenant will pass through Sarah’s son, Isaac. Thus, God makes it clear that not
   <i>
    all
   </i>
   of Abraham’s descendants are part of this covenant,
   <i>
    only the ones of Sarah.
   </i>
   This underscores Sarah’s crucial role; it makes Sarah and Abraham, physically speaking, equal partners in the covenant.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In a sense, the greatest “sign” of this covenant is the fulfillment of God’s promise that Sarah will bear a child. Sarah’s pregnancy and Isaac’s birth are tangible proof that God fulfills promises—and will similarly fulfill the other promises. Perhaps women after Sarah, as the ones bearing life, carry on the covenant between God and Abraham and Sarah’s descendants in the most basic, physical way. Maybe circumcision is a male ritual to include men in a physical way in the covenant that women make real in their flesh when they bear the next generation.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   This view has its own problems. Women of every nation bear children; how can childbearing be an essential characteristic or sign of a particular covenant? And what about women who will not bear children? Are they excluded from the covenant?

   We need to look further. Scholars such as Savina Teubal argue that the world described in the Torah was preceded by a matriarchal system in which women held significant power, perhaps as priestesses. The decisive role of the matriarchs in determining the transmission of this male covenant (through Isaac and later Jacob) might be a trace from a time of greater female power (
   <i>
    Sarah the Priestess: The First Matriarch of Genesis,

   But regardless of its origins, Jews today understand the

   having a

Eventually, this group crafted a ritual that continues to be used by individuals and communities in the United States, Israel, and other countries.

   This idea—of washing a baby girl’s feet to welcome her into the covenant between the Jewish people and God—grew out of our reading of
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
    Genesis 17–18
   </a>
   . Immediately after the covenant in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
    Genesis 17
   </a>
   , when Abraham is circumcised, Abraham invites three visitors passing by for a meal (18:1–15). He washes their feet, a sign of welcome in his own day. Abraham’s guests, who prove to be God’s messengers, announce the future birth of Isaac.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Abraham’s act of washing his guests’ feet, as a sign of welcome, therefore, is closely associated with the original establishment of the
   <i>
    b’rit
   </i>
   in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
    Genesis 17
   </a>
   . Washing the baby’s feet allows us to introduce water into the ritual, and to make the association with Miriam’s Well,
   <i>
    mikveh
   </i>
   (ritual bath), and the healing, nurturing power of its
   <i>
    mayim chayim
   </i>
   (fresh water, literally “living waters”). The ritual includes readings and music that bring out these motifs and involves the parents as well. Usually the formal naming of the baby follows, with blessings over wine, as at a male circumcision. This ritual, simple and gentle, lends itself to individual adaptation and creativity (see “The Covenant of Washing: A Ceremony to Welcome Baby Girls Into the Covenant of Israel,”
   <i>
    Menorah,
   </i>
   IV/3–4, May 1983).

   Was Sarah part of the covenant? For centuries, Jews have looked to Sarah as the first of our foremothers. Women’s
   <i>
    tekhines
   </i>
   (petitionary prayers) have called upon the God of Sarah, and pleaded in Sarah’ name on women’s behalf. As the covenant continues to be fulfilled by the commitment of every new generation of Jews, the impassioned voices of Jewish women bring forth Sarah’s voice in our own time, with new clarity. Today we can celebrate a rediscovered Sarah as the mother of the covenant we the Jewish people share with God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Even if
   <i>
    b’rit bat
   </i>
   rituals have not always been part of Jewish tradition, they are so today. Mothers who were welcomed into the covenant with such ceremonies now perform these same rituals with their own babies. Generations from now, Jews may be surprised to learn that baby girls were not always welcomed into the covenant with a ritual
   <i>
    b’rit bat.
   </i>
   As contemporary men and women today, we can look forward to seeing such rituals flourish and evolve in the years ahead.
