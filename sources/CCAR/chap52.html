   </small>
   (“[he] went”) is the shortest portion in the Torah, consisting of only thirty verses. It begins with Moses standing before the Israelites in the plains of Moab, just across the Jordan River from the Promised Land. He delivers an encouraging message to Israel (
   <a href="#deu_31.1-13">
    31:1–13
   </a>
   ), in which he assures the people that although he is about to die, God will lead them into the Land, wiping out any obstacles in their path. To reinforce Joshua’s legitimacy as their new leader, Moses appoints him in front of all Israel.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Moses then writes down the Teaching (
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   ) and instructs the priests and elders regarding future public readings of the written text. As in
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#deu_29.9-28">
    29:9–10
   </a>
   , the text makes the inclusive nature of the covenant explicit, specifying that men, women, children, and strangers are to listen to and learn from God’s Teaching (
   <a href="#deu31-12">
    31:12
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In the second part of the parashah (
   <a href="#deu_31.14-23">
    vv. 14–23
   </a>
   ), God begins to speak, delivering a darkly pessimistic message. God anticipates that immediately after Moses’ death, the people will go astray by worshiping other gods. As a result, Moses must write down the words of a poem as witness against the people.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Finally, Moses again speaks to the people (
   <a href="#deu_31.24-30">
    vv. 24–30
   </a>
   ); but now, as if infected by God’s disappointment, Moses too predicts misfortune in Israel’s future. In addition, repeatedly the parashah emphasizes the transmission of God’s teaching as a written text.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Regarding the treatment of women in this parashah, they are mentioned explicitly only once (
   <a href="#deu31-12">
    v. 12
   </a>
   ), although they are included implicitly as part of the “people.” Nevertheless, readers might consider a number of questions sparked by the parashah:
  </div>
  <div class="image">
   <img alt="images" src="../Images/border1.jpg"/>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar1">
   <b>
    <i>
     <span class="drop1">
      T
     </span>
     he parashah makes it clear: women and men must study Torah and apply it to their lives.
    </i>
   </b>
  </div>
  <div class="image0">
   <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>

  <div class="blist">

   <span class="space">
   </span>
   What are the repercussions of having the tale narrated by a single dominant male voice, that of Moses? The story as told is shaped by the teller and his particular interests; and, in turn, this story will shape the type of community that Israel will become. What if, instead, the story were to be told from the perspective of a female figure, such as Miriam? What might a female narrator have considered crucial if she were asked to retell the events of the wilderness journey? What vision of community might she propose?
  </div>
  <div class="blist">

   <span class="space">
   </span>
   Moses passes the reins of communal leadership from himself to Joshua. Who would have been a fitting successor to his sister, Miriam—the prophet and leader who died not long beforehand (
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_20.1-29">
    Numbers 20:1
   </a>
   )?
  </div>
  <div class="blist">
   <a id="page_1236">
   </a>

   <span class="space">
   </span>
   The depiction of Moses writing down the
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   (which in this context refers to the teachings in Deuteronomy) prompts speculation: Could a female author have written a biblical book? While answers to these questions remain largely conjectural, the parashah makes one thing quite clear: women as well as men must hear and study the Torah and apply it to their lives.

   where both the verb and its object derive from the same root (
   <i>

   <i>

   </i>
   ) that Moses addressed (
   <i>

   </i>
   ) to all Israel” (
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#deu_1.1-5">
    1:1
   </a>
   ). Soon, at the end of his long series of speeches, Moses will write down these precious words as his legacy to Israel (
   <a href="#chap-fn9-1">
    v. 9

   ). At Deuteronomy’s end, the oral and the written become inextricably linked.

   The Hebrew idiom for a lack of physical motion in an aged Moses is more suggestive—literally “I am no longer able to go out or come in.” The image of movement is reinforced by God’s next words, reminding Moses that he cannot cross over the Jordan and enter the land.

   Moses turns from his own fate to the people’s, who shortly will leave him behind. Poignantly he speaks of “your God,” not including himself in the address. Since Moses will not cross the Jordan (
   <a href="#deu_31.1-13">
    v. 2
   </a>
   ), God and Joshua will cross before the Israelites (
   <a href="#chap-fn2-1">
    v. 3

   ) to ensure victory as they settle the land.

   The syntax of this phrase is odd, forcing the English translation to add dashes to make sense of the sentence. The prior sentence states that God’s destruction of the nations will end with Israel’s dispossessing them. Then, almost as an afterthought, Joshua is introduced. This clearly tacked-on phrase suggests an editorial insertion to draw attention to the role that Joshua will assume. The verse reflects a tension between God’s actions on our behalf and the human means by which those actions are accomplished.

   About to die, Moses retells what happened in the past. As in
   <i>
    parashat D’varim,
   </i>
   he shapes Israel’s memories of the wilderness journey in order to teach lessons pertinent to the present moment. (For speculation on how a female narrator might have reshaped the story, see the introduction to this parashah.)

   MOSES ENCOURAGES THE PEOPLE AND JOSHUA: “BE STRONG AND RESOLUTE” (31:6–8)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   These three verses present the reader with an identifiable section that shows signs of careful editing through the use of repetition and inversion to make a highly political point to the Israelite audience.
   <a href="#chap-fn6-1">
    Verse 6
   </a>
   contains four clauses that claim a cause-and-effect relationship, stressing that the people Israel can be strong and free of fear because God is with them and will not let them down.
   <a href="#page_1239">
    Verses 7–8
   </a>
   include language nearly identical to that of Moses when he commissions Joshua. One noteworthy difference between
   <a href="#page_1239">
    vv. 7–8
   </a>
   and
   <a href="#chap-fn6-1">
    v. 6
   </a>
   is the insertion of Joshua’s name as the one who will lead the people along with God. Because he assumes this role, Israel should accept his equally important function as the one who divides the land among the tribes. The politics of succession as well as the necessary persuasion to secure Joshua’s legitimacy are in play here. The deft weaving together of similar language in each passage signals that God approves the arrangement.

   and
   <a href="#deu31-23">

   </i>
   Here and in
   <a href="#chap-fn7-1a">
    v. 8
   </a>
   , Moses assures the people and Joshua that God will not forsake or abandon them. The same verbal root
   <i>
    (e-z-b)
   </i>
   is used later when God foreshadows that Israel will forsake God (
   <a href="#deu31-16">
    v. 16
   </a>
   ), which in turn will result in God forsaking them (
   <a href="#chap-fn17-1a">
    v. 17
   </a>
   ). In Isaiah 49:14–15, the identical verb is used when the people in exile express their anxiety that God has deserted them. In response, the prophet reassures them by means of a rhetorical question that compares God to a mother: “Can a mother forget her babe, or stop loving the child of her womb? Even these could forget, but I could not forget you.”

   </i>
   Just as Joshua prepares to take the lead after Moses’ death, his brother Aaron also has a successor, Eleazar (
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#num_20.1-29">
    Numbers 20:26
   </a>
   ). While no one is designated to succeed their sister Miriam, Deborah would be a fitting choice. Deborah, like Miriam (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:20
   </a>
   ), is called a prophet (Judges 4:4); and she is praised as “Mother in Israel” (Judges 5:7), a title that most likely indicates her role as a leader during the period of the Judges. Also, just as Miriam sings a song of victory and praise after crossing the Sea of Reeds (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#E15-21">
    Exodus 15:20–21
   </a>
   ), so too does Deborah sing a song of praise after the defeat of Sisera (Judges 5). It is intriguing that both of these two poems, which are thought to be among the oldest compositions in the Bible, are associated with women. (On women as singers of victory songs and other poetic compositions, see at
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.1-21">
    Exodus 15:1–19
   </a>
   and

   </i>
   Here and in
   <a href="#deu_31.24-30">
    v. 24
   </a>
   , we have explicit mention of Moses writing the Teaching (
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   ). Elsewhere in Deuteronomy, the written
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   is discussed without attributing its writing to Moses (see
   <a href="#chap-fn17-1a">
    17:18
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="53_chapter_50.xhtml#deu27-8">
    27:8
   </a>
   ). Thus the later tradition that Moses wrote the entire Torah may begin with this parashah.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   In certain passages in Exodus, the word
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   refers to divine precepts authoritative for the community (for instance, see
   <i>
    torat YHVH
   </i>
   in
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e13-9">
    Exodus 13:9
   </a>
   ). In Leviticus and Numbers, the term typically refers to priestly instructions, either oral or written on separate scrolls that priests keep to themselves; in such cases, the word often is translated as “ritual” (see at
   <a href="28_chapter_25.xhtml#levi_6.1-7.38">
    Leviticus 6:2
   </a>
   ). In Deuteronomy,
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   generally refers to “this Teaching,” meaning the book of Deuteronomy or perhaps its legal parts (see at 1:5; 17:18; 27:3); it designates a written text that becomes central to Israel’s life as a community, for it contains God’s rules for all of Israel. As many scholars note, Deuteronomy lays the foundation for Judaism’s becoming a religion of the book.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Later biblical books speak of the
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   of Moses (for instance, Joshua 8:31; 23:6; I Kings 2:3; II Kings 14:6; 23:25; Ezra 7:6; Nehemiah 8:1). These references to the Teaching of Moses appear in times of instability or crisis, including a transition in rule, a moment of religious or political reform, or the return of the exiles from Babylon. Thus the Teaching
   <i>
    (torah)
   </i>
   of Moses provides guidance and an anchor for Israel.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   No such explicit association exists between a woman and a work of the Hebrew Bible. One possible comparison is Song of Songs. Although attributed to Solomon, this biblical book reproduces the voice of a woman as its chief speaker or singer. In addition, the book of Ruth could have been written by a woman, given the central relationship of the daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law and the dominance of female economic concerns.

   Jeffrey Tigay suggests a practical reason for reading the Teaching at this time. Since Sukkot marks the end of the agricultural cycle, the people have some leisure and, depending on the harvest’s success, a sense of security and gratitude. As a consequence, Sukkot in Jerusalem would have been the best-attended of the festivals, giving the Jerusalem priests both a large audience and ample time to read the Teaching publicly. He estimates that all of Deuteronomy could be read in three or four hours (
   <i>
    Deuteronomy
   </i>
   , 1996, pp. 291–92). Note the specific mention of women in
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#chap-fn13-6">
    16:13–14

   among those instructed to celebrate Sukkot.

   </i>
   Deuteronomy is a book of religious vision and reform. An unnamed central site (presumably the Temple in Jerusalem) is to replace the many high places and cultic sites found in Judah at that time (see at
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu12-2">
    12:2–14
   </a>
   ). The public reading of the scroll would reinforce the centrality of the Temple in Jerusalem as God’s Chosen Place.

   </i>
   The
   <i>
    torah
   </i>
   is preserved and written down, but it is read aloud to the many who either do not have a copy or would not be able to read it. In narratives about the later periods in Israel’s history, such a public reading is said to have occurred during the period of intense religious reform under Josiah (II Kings 23) and after the return from exile, when Ezra reads the Torah aloud (Nehemiah 8). Nehemiah 8:2 emphasizes that the audience is composed of “men and women and all who could listen with understanding” (also
   <a href="#chap-fn2-1">
    v. 3

   God often appears to Moses, and at times to the people, behind a veil of some kind, shielding the observer from a direct view of God’s manifestation. (See also at

   God’s warning about the people’s misbehavior that will follow Moses’ death introduces an angry, melancholy note into the parashah. Just as earlier repentance and reconciliation are depicted as reciprocal (see at
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#deu_30.1-10">
    30:1–10
   </a>
   ), so here are rebellion and rejection. The core message of this section is that since the people will abandon God, God will abandon the people (
   <a href="#deu31-16">

   </i>
   Literally, “go whoring after.” Here and in several prophetic books (see Hosea 2; Jeremiah 3:1; Ezekiel 16, 23), prostitution is used as a metaphor for adultery and apostasy. The betrayal involved in adultery forms the basis of an analogy to vividly express God’s sense of betrayal when Israel worships other gods. This comparison fits with the broader conception of the relationship between God and Israel as a marriage, a metaphor that conveys both the love that binds the metaphoric husband and wife, as well as God’s deep disappointment when Israel turns to “alien gods” (see also at
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu5-9">
    5:9
   </a>
   ).

   This expression refers to Canaanite gods. Yet in
   <a href="#chap-fn3-1">
    v. 3
   </a>
   , Moses announces that God will destroy the nations (and presumably their idols) once they cross into the land of Canaan. This contradiction anticipates the tension found in the books of Joshua and Judges between the claim to have wiped out the local inhabitants and the fact that Israel repeatedly interacts with those already in the land. The contradiction seems to suggest that a widespread destruction of other peoples did not in fact occur (see also at
   <a href="47_chapter_44.xhtml#deu2-34">
    2:34
   </a>
   ;

   ;
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#deu12-29">

   Here and in

   God’s response to Moses’ impending absence is to demand a written text. Some interpreters understand the poem to serve as an accusation against the people in the generations to come, preventing them from misconstruing the past. In other words, the poem will testify to the fact that God abandoned them for just cause (Jeffrey Tigay,
   <i>
    Deuteronomy,
   </i>
   1996, p. 295). Others have reinterpreted this verse to understand the poem not as a witness
   <i>
    against
   </i>
   Israel, but as a witness
   <i>
    on behalf of
   </i>
   Israel, reminding God “not to judge the people Israel harshly in the future, for God was aware of their nature (
   <a href="#chap-fn27-1">
    v. 27
   </a>
   ) and chose them nonetheless” (attributed to Rabbi Meir “Malbim” in David Lieber, ed.,
   <i>

   2001, p. 1177).

   These verses reiterate God’s charge in
   <a href="#deu31-16">
    vv. 16–19

   , but with an added accusation against Israel. After God fulfills the promise made to the ancestors—to settle their descendants in a land flowing with milk and honey—the people will partake of the land’s abundance; but they will fail to connect their prosperity to the God who brought them there.

   <a href="#deu31-16">
    vv. 16–22

   (God’s angry speech and the anticipation of the poem as a witness against Israel) were inserted into the account of Moses’ completion of the writing of the Teaching.

    AYEILECH DESCRIBES
   </small>
   Moses’ final preparations before taking leave of Israel. On the verge of his death, Moses appoints Joshua as military commander. He also sets the date on which the Torah should be read publicly; and, in an attempt to protect the people from God’s wrath, he teaches the poem
   <i>
    Haazinu
   </i>
   (the content of
   <a href="56_chapter_53.xhtml#deu_32.1-43">
    Deuteronomy 32
   </a>
   , in the next parashah). Knowing that he cannot enter the Promised Land and that he is about to die does not make Moses less committed to the nation. On the contrary, he carries out these preparations with great care and attention to detail, demonstrating his love and devotion to Israel.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   One way that the parashah communicates this message is through the repetition of the word “all”
   <i>
    (kol).
   </i>
   <a href="55_chapter_52.xhtml#deu_31.24-30">
    Deuteronomy 31
   </a>
   begins with the statement that Moses addresses “all Israel” (
   <a href="#deu_31.1-13">
    31:1
   </a>
   ), and that “in the sight of all Israel” (
   <a href="#page_1239">
    31:7
   </a>
   ) he appoints Joshua as commander. The expression “all Israel” (
   <i>
    kol Yisrael)
   </i>
   is used frequently in Deuteronomy, reflecting the continued insistence that no individual should be left out. When Moses charges the priests and “all the elders of Israel” to impart God’s Teaching (
   <a href="#chap-fn9-1">
    31:9
   </a>
   ), he repeats the command that this must be done when “all Israel” appears before God (
   <a href="#chap-fn10-1">
    31:11
   </a>
   ). Moses specifies that “men, women, children, and the strangers” must be gathered to learn “every word” of the Teaching
   <i>
    (kol divrei hatorah)
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#deu31-12">
    31:12
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Moses demonstrates his concern and conscientiousness in other ways, too. In particular, he makes sure that women are included. Just as
   <a href="54_chapter_51.xhtml#deu_29.9-28">
    29:10
   </a>
   makes it clear that women are part of the covenant ceremony,
   <a href="#deu31-12">
    31:12
   </a>
   states explicitly that women must study and faithfully observe the terms of the covenant. Similarly, Moses writes down the words of this Teaching “to the very end” (
   <a href="#deu_31.24-30">
    31:24
   </a>
   ), and he also recites the words of the poem “to the very end” (
   <a href="#deu31-30">
    31:30
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   The word
   <i>
    kol
   </i>
   also appears in an earlier passage, one that shows Moses at a rather different point in his life. During the course of the wilderness wanderings, Moses uses a striking maternal metaphor when, exasperated, he tries to distance himself from the people: “Did I produce [or: conceive] all this people
   <i>
    (kol haam
   </i>
   ), did I engender [or: give birth to] them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom as a caretaker carries an infant,’ to the land that You have promised on oath to their fathers?” (
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#num_11.1-12.16">
    Numbers 11:12
   </a>
   ). Now, at the end of the journey, Moses contemplates death, not birth. Like a loving parent, he conscientiously prepares to bid his “children” farewell as they enter the Promised Land without him.

   (
   <a href="#deu_31.1-13">

   <i>
    Sotah

   13b asserted that in his old age the “sources of wisdom” were stopped

   <a href="#deu31-12">
    31:12

   ). While the Rabbis apparently took for granted that the entire community of Israel was required to hear the divine “Teaching,” medieval interpreters (not usually known for their egalitarianism) wondered why the women were included. Rashi emphasized the distinction between the men and women: whereas the men were there to learn, the women were capable only of listening.
   <i>
    Tanna D’Vei Eliyahu,
   </i>
   a book of midrashim collected in the 10th century
   <small>
    C. E.
   </small>
   , uses this verse to prove that it is the man’s responsibility to ensure that every member of his household follows the law faithfully (p. 112). The medieval commentator Nachmanides disagreed, emphasizing in his comments on this verse that the women who were present also learned to fear God.

  <div class="tab-enin">

     When Moses had put down in writing the words of this Teaching to the very end
    </b>
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#deu_31.24-30">
    31:24
   </a>
   ). What does this “Teaching” constitute? Most of the Rabbis understood it to refer to the entire Torah, although they debated whether Moses actually wrote the last eight verses of Deuteronomy that recount his death (see BT
   <i>
    Bava Batra
   </i>
   14b–15a). This understanding of Mosaic authorship is present in the Dead Sea Scrolls, where quotations from the Torah are often introduced by “Moses said,” or “as written in the Book of Moses.” However,
   <i>
    Tanna D’Vei Eliyahu
   </i>
   specifically designates God as the author, maintaining that the Torah was composed before the creation of the world (p. 160) (see Midrash
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   1.1). According to this midrash, the divinely revealed words are only called the “Torah of Moses” on account of God’s great mercy toward Israel’s greatest prophet. Several early interpretations of the Bible, such as the pseudepigraphical book of Jubilees, note that the purpose of the writing down of the Law was to remind future generations of the terms of the covenant and of Israel’s obligations to fulfill it. The
   <i>
    Testament of Moses
   </i>
   <a href="49_chapter_46.xhtml#deu10-11">
    10:11
   </a>
   , another pseudepigraphical book, emphasizes that it was now Joshua’s responsibility to keep the words and the book.

    21–22

   <a href="#deu31-30">

   </i>
   this
   <i>

   </i>
   (
   <a href="56_chapter_53.xhtml#deu_32.1-43">

   ), in which Moses calls upon heaven and earth as witnesses, is known as the “Song of Moses.” Since
   <a href="#chap-fn26-1">
    31:26
   </a>
   designates the Torah as witness against Israel, some of the Rabbis smoothed out the relationship between the “Teaching” and the “Song” by equating the two (see BT

   <i>

   Israel, following the literal reading of

   , other rabbinic texts demonstrate that Moses frequently defended Israel to God. Thus, BT
   <i>

   </i>
   32a recalls that following the episode of the Golden Calf, God said, “Let Me alone and I will destroy them” (9:14); but Moses immediately “stood up, prayed vigorously, and begged for mercy” on Israel’s behalf. According to Midrash
   <i>
    D’varim Rabbah

   3.11, “Moses left no corner in heaven upon which he did not prostrate himself in prayer” on Israel’s behalf (also Midrash
   <i>
    Sh’mot Rabbah

   42.9). BT
   <i>

   (
   <a href="#deu31-30">

   ). The Rabbis speak of ten sublime “poems” (or “songs”; Heb.
   <i>

   </i>
   in the Hebrew Bible that mark central events in the history of the people of Israel; although they differ on the exact listing of the ten,
   <a id="page_1247">
   </a>
   they all include this poem (Midrash
   <i>
    M’chilta, B’shalach, Shirta

   1). Several of the other songs mentioned are specifically associated with women, including the Song of Miriam, in which she sang and led the women in dance (
   <a href="19_chapter_16.xhtml#exo_15.1-21">
    Exodus 15:20–21

   1, the tenth song will be recited in the messianic era: “Sing a new song to

    T WAS THE MOMENT
   </small>
   for which Moses had prepared nearly all his life. Reared in Egyptian luxury, mothered by a princess, Moses might have lived out his 120 years in careless splendor, unconcerned with the fate of hordes of Israelite slaves who labored outside his palace. Yet, from the moment that Moses—still a young man—slays the Egyptian taskmaster, he chooses to cast his lot with the slaves. For their sake—and their God’s—Moses spends forty years traversing the wilderness, leading a complaining and defiant people, interceding with an inscrutable and demanding Sovereign, and somehow transforming the despised and oppressed into witnesses of miracles and keepers of revelation. The work is almost finished. God and Moses have brought the people to the edge of the Promised Land, a place Moses will not reach. He will gaze upon it from the heights of Mount Nebo, but he will die before he enters it.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Why will Moses forgo the glorious completion of the task into which he has poured his very life? In
   <i>
    parashat Vayeilech,
   </i>
   Moses himself explains: “I am now one hundred and twenty years old, I can no longer be active” (
   <a href="#deu_31.1-13">
    31:2
   </a>
   ). Translated more literally, Moses says, “I can no longer go out and come in.” Either way, the message seems clear: Moses is tired out; he is no longer feeling strong or vigorous. So he will remain on this side of the Jordan River, take a peek at the Promised Land, and then die a peaceful and contented death. It may seem strange that he is willing to miss this crowning achievement; but this appears to be his choice.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Except, of course, that he has not made such a choice. As the verse continues, Moses adds what might seem to be a secondary explanation, an after-thought—yet it contains some crucial information: “Moreover,
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   has said to me, ‘You shall not go across yonder Jordan’” (
   <a href="#deu_31.1-13">

   ).

   After all, isn’t this the real reason that Moses will not enter the Promised Land? The Torah itself is quite clear that what Moses had done at a certain point prompted God to forbid him from crossing the Jordan. We read the unequivocal divine decree first in
   <a href="42_chapter_39.xhtml#n20-13">
    Numbers 20:12
   </a>
   . After devoting his life to serving God’s chosen nation, Moses shall not set foot in God’s chosen land.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Moses’ fate is painful, even tragic. Standing before the people he has so steadfastly led, he prepares not to shepherd them triumphantly into the Promised Land, but to install a new leader who will bring them to their destiny. It is, for Moses, a moment of enormous loss. He may speak as if he has a choice—as if he could lead the Israelites into the Land if only he were a little younger, a little stronger—but truly there is no choice at all. He may act as if he has freely decided to stay behind, but it is clear that the choice was made for him.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   Today, we like to make our own choices. We live in a time when almost every institution, every career, every level of leadership beckons us. We swell with
   <a id="page_1248">
   </a>
   pride and optimism as we see women serving in the highest echelons of government, in our universities and in our armed forces, as respected doctors, artists, scientists, teachers, philanthropists. We prepare ourselves and our daughters for lives in which every possibility is open to us. We can choose the life we want to live—except when we cannot.

  <div class="tab-enin">
   Except when a 14-year-old girl falls prey to our society’s unspoken message to young women—“You are not pretty enough. You are not popular enough. You are not thin enough”—and spends her adolescence battling hateful voices in her head. She may tell you that she chose to watch her weight and eat very little. But in many ways, that choice has been made for her.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Except when a wife endures an abusive relationship, convinced that she is worthless and unable to make her own way in the world. When her husband begins to threaten their children, she finally gathers her courage and flees. Without money or marketable skills, she earns only substandard wages. She may tell you that she chose to go it alone, to work for low pay because she needs a job, to do without health care for herself so that she could provide for her family. But in many ways, that choice has been made for her.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   Except when a woman devotes countless eighty-hour workweeks to her career and so is only a year or two away from a prestigious promotion when she and her spouse have a baby. When she returns to the office, her appeals for flexible hours, the chance occasionally to work from home, even a private place to express breast milk, are refused. She may tell you that she chose to quit her job and not work in an unsupportive environment, chose the rewards of at-home motherhood over the rewards of professional life. But in many ways, that choice has been made for her.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-enin">
   We find women all around us submitting to pressures and expectations that undercut our right to choose the life we want to live. And yet, the pressures and the expectations that we encounter are not God’s will. Whereas Moses’ ability to choose his destiny ended when God made known the heavenly decree, our choices should not—must not—be bound by earthly decrees that dishonor and punish women, that teach young girls they are not good enough, that refuse to assist a persecuted victim in need, that force a mother to decide between her career and her child. Acknowledging the injustice of the choices women often face is surely the first step toward changing the pattern.

I am sitting now by a quiet canal, my legs dangling over the stone wall, and I wonder whether one day my heart will be so weary and worn that it will no longer fly where it wants, free as a bird.
