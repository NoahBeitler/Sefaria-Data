    ARASHAT
   </small>
   Bo (“go”) features three final signs from God (locusts, darkness, and the slaying of the first-born), following directly after the first seven signs in the previous parashah. (Although in English parlance this series of events is commonly called “the Ten Plagues,” the Hebrew text refers to them mainly as “signs,” “marvels,” or “wonders”; see further at
   <a href="#exo_11.1-12.28">
    11:1
   </a>
   .) Then the narrative from which this book takes its English name reaches its climax as the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt begins. Framing the account of the last sign and the hurried flight from Egypt are instructions for the (annual) passover sacrifice and the Festival of Matzot (Unleavened Bread).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   An overriding theme in this Torah portion is God’s omnipotence. The signs are meant to prove to Pharaoh, all Egypt, and the burgeoning people of Israel that Israel’s God reigns supreme. Because of Pharaoh’s stubborn willfulness, God’s determination to respond to the outcry of the oppressed Israelites (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e3-7">
    3:7
   </a>
   ) ultimately leads to a loud cry in Egypt as the anguish of the death of every first-born male echoes in the night (
   <a href="#e11-6">
    11:6
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="#exo_12.29-36">
    12:30
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The theme of remembrance also recurs throughout this parashah. Several passages emphasize the importance of teaching future generations about how God saved the Israelites (
   <a href="#exo_10.1-29">
    10:2
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="#E12-26">
    12:26–27
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="#e13-14">
    13:14–15
   </a>
   ). Also, a number of apparently existing rites—including the Festival of Matzot (
   <a href="#e12-14">
    12:14
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="#e13-3">
    13:3
   </a>
   ),
   <i>
    t’fillin
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#e13-9">
    13:9
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#e13-16">
    16
   </a>
   ), and the redemption of the first-born (
   <a href="#e13-14">
    13:14–15
   </a>
   )—are linked to the Exodus to institutionalize its memory.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Many readers of this parashah wonder about the historicity of the Exodus story. It is important to remember that these events are not recounted as verifiable history. Rather, the narrative describes a people’s collective memory of their past. As such, the historical accuracy of the account is unimportant, for it has no bearing on the story’s core message or themes. (See

   We find a few scattered references to women throughout this parashah. When Moses negotiates with Pharaoh, he insists that every Israelite—including the women—be permitted to leave Egypt to worship God (
   <a href="#e10-9">
    10:9
   </a>
   ). Further on, as the Israelites prepare to leave, women are instructed to “borrow” objects of silver and gold from their female Egyptian neighbors (
   <a href="#exo_11.1-12.28">
    11:2
   </a>
   ). (They will later donate such materials for the Tabernacle;
   <a href="25_chapter_22.xhtml#e35-22">
    35:22–29
   </a>
   .) In addition, Moses warns the people that every Egyptian first-born male will die—even the oldest child of “the slave girl who is behind the millstones” (
   <a href="#e11-6">
    11:5
   </a>
   ).
   <a id="page_356">
   </a>
   The image of her grinding grain into flour reflects the role women played in the complex production of bread (see at
   <a href="#e11-6">
    11:5
   </a>
   and
   <a href="#E12-2">
    12:8
   </a>
   ). Although we repeatedly read about unleavened bread in this parashah (
   <a href="#E12-2">
    12:8
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#e12-14">
    14–20
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#e12-39">
    39
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="#e13-3">
    13:3–8
   </a>
   ), the text does not mention who makes the matzah. Textual and archeological evidence suggests that women would have baked the unleavened cakes of dough that are part of the story of the Israelites’ fleeing from Egypt. As an integral part of each Israelite “family” and “household” (
   <a href="#E12-2">
    12:3
   </a>
   ), women experience the long-awaited Exodus, the unprecedented redemptive act that becomes the foundation for the relationship between God and Israel.

     For if you refuse to let My people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts on your territory.

     Moreover, they shall fill your palaces and the houses of all your courtiers and of all the Egyptians—something that neither your fathers nor fathers’ fathers have seen from the day they appeared on earth to this day.’” With that he turned and left Pharaoh’s presence.

   he previous parashah ended after a series of seven signs of divine power. According to the narrator, Pharaoh reacted to these signs by “stiffening” his “heart” (that is, his will). Following the 5th sign, God began to “harden” Pharaoh’s heart. Nevertheless, his free will remained (
   <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#e9-29">
    9:35
   </a>
   ).

  <div class="tab-en1">
   Now, after Moses and Aaron again warn Pharaoh—and God once again hardens his heart—the east wind ushers in an unprecedented swarm of locusts. The grand scale of this 8th sign underscores that it is a one-time, cataclysmic event aimed to demonstrate God’s supremacy.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Pharaoh is unable to relent. This will lead to a 9th sign—darkness—which is announced and performed without confrontation with, or warning to, Pharaoh (just like the 3rd and 6th signs; see

   A major theme of this parashah is God’s omnipotence, especially in relation to the pharaoh. The narrator insists on showing that God completely controls all that is happening, as exemplified by the way God hardens Pharaoh’s heart. (Earlier, Pharaoh hardens his own heart, as in
   <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#e8-12">
    8:15
   </a>
   .)

   </i>
   Literally, God “made [Pharaoh’s heart] heavy” (from the root
   <i>
    k-b-d,
   </i>
   “to be heavy”). The image of the heavy heart may relate to the ancient Egyptian conception that in the afterlife, when weighed on the scales of judgment, the virtuous soul is found to have a heart that is lighter than a feather, whereas the sinner has a heavy heart.

   </i>
   The memory of the bondage in and redemption from Egypt is central to Israel’s covenantal relationship with God, as seen in the prologue to the Decalogue (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#ex20-2">
    20:2
   </a>
   ). Moses is addressed in the singular here, as the one who will begin the process of the retelling of the enslavement and exodus to subsequent generations in order to ensure that these events do not fade from Israelite memory.

     </span>
     .”
    </b>
   </a>
   As with the other signs, part of God’s stated motivation for these events is to demonstrate and authenticate the divine Presence, thus eliciting recognition of God’s power from both the Egyptians and the Israelites.

   Heb.

   </i>
   (traditionally “the men”), which the present translation understands as referring to a group’s representatives. The courtiers’ plea to Pharaoh is to dispatch the Israelite elders or officials—presumably men; thus Pharaoh asks for a specific list (v. 8).

   </i>
   In his reply, Moses shows that the courtiers’ limited offer is unacceptable: he includes all the people as well as the livestock. Moses and Aaron had originally resorted to a ruse, telling Pharaoh that they wanted to leave only in order to worship their God at a distance of three days’ journey into the wilderness (see
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e5-1">
    5:1
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e5-1">

   </a>
   ). Since they have no intention of returning to Egypt, no one and nothing can be left behind.

   Literally, “with our underlings and with our elders” or “with our youths and with our old folks”; the Hebrew terms can refer either to socioeconomic status or to age.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   This type of expression is called a “merism,” meaning that the figure of speech uses two extremes to convey a totality, as if it said “and everybody in between.”

   Later, when the Israelites cross the Sea of Reeds, God will again bring an east wind to turn the water into dry ground (see at

   Thus the 8th sign anticipates the final and most crushing divine act, the death of the first-born sons (

   Despite Pharaoh’s earlier restriction that only the men leave (v. 11, rendered there as “you gentlemen”), he now relents and acquiesces to Moses’ demand that all the people be allowed to leave (v. 9).

   a flexible term whose sense depends on what it complements. Since Moses previously specified that everyone would go, including “our youths and our old folks” and “our sons and daughters” (v. 9; see comments there), its scope must include the women as well as children. Most individuals in this category would be economically productive members of their household.

   ine signs from God in dramatic escalation have led to the present impasse: Pharaoh is unwilling to relent. However, God has already hinted at a 10th sign (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e4-21">
    4:23
   </a>
   ), and now it is announced. But before describing the execution of that sign, the narrative will pause to embed in the story two ritual acts—a passover offering and a Feast of Matzot—that are to be commemorated annually.

   ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TENTH SIGN (11:1–10)

   The final calamity, which is labeled a “plague” (see at
   <a href="#exo_11.1-12.28">
    11:1
   </a>
   ), proves decisive. It is introduced at length and receives more narrative space than any of the others; the account is more dramatic and also more disturbing to modern readers. Although the Egyptians are condemned for inflicting bondage on the Israelites and attempting to kill Hebrew babies, God’s killing of innocent Egyptians may still raise theological and ethical questions for a contemporary audience. However, these concerns are not central to the biblical account. From the Bible’s perspective, the main purpose of the signs is to prove God’s might and supreme control. While recognizing the literary function and ahistorical nature of these texts helps to provide perspective on the seeming injustice of God’s actions, many nevertheless struggle with what remains for them a troubling biblical text.

   This revelation to Moses interrupts the heated exchange between Moses and Pharaoh and begins the instructions to the Israelites regarding preparations for the impending exodus. This interruption heightens the tension preceding the actual exodus from Egypt.

   ) (
   <i>
    Exodus
   </i>
   , 2005, pp. 76–77). At the same time, the phrasing here (“one more plague”) suggests that all ten events generally are “plagues,” referring to how the Egyptians experience them.

      “borrow.”
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The Bible gives no indication of any intention to return the Egyptians’ objects. The Hebrew word translated as “borrow” has a range of meanings, including “ask” or “demand” (see also at
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E3-16">
    3:22
   </a>
   ). To explain the Israelites’ actions, commentators connect this verse with
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#d15-13">
    Deuteronomy 15:13
   </a>
   , which states that a Hebrew slave should not be set free without payment. As early as the 2nd century
   <small>
    B.C.E.
   </small>
   , the despoiling of the Egyptians was considered recompense for the labor of bondage (Jubilees 48:18).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">

     <a href="#chap-fn2-2a" id="chap-fn02-2a">
      “each man from his neighbor and each woman from hers.”
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   In this context, the grammatically masculine language of the first phrase alone could have been understood as gender inclusive. God’s instructions thus go out of their way to specify that the Israelite men are to interact with the Egyptian men, and the Israelite women are to deal with the Egyptian women.

   Presumably Egyptians, not Israelites (see
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e12-35">
    12:35
   </a>
   ), thus implying that the Israelites lived in close proximity to at least some Egyptians. See also at

    </b>
   </i>
   One of the main points of the account of the signs is that God is all-powerful: God rules heaven and earth and all therein, including the Egyptians. Each biblical reference to this episode underscores that the Egyptians willingly gave their belongings to the Israelites as a result of God’s intervention, meaning that the silver and gold was not plunder, but freely given (see
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E3-16">
    3:19–22
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e12-35">

      “every [male] first-born.”
     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   This translation clarifies that the plague will target specifically first-born sons, not daughters.

  <div class="tab-en1">

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   Another merism (see at
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e10-9">
    10:9
   </a>
   ): the intent of this act is to affect all Egyptian households, from the highest male aristocracy to the lowest female slave. The Torah is not concerned with the guilt or innocence of any specific victim, nor with the ethical implications of blanket punishments; the focus remains resolutely on exemplifying God’s supreme power.

   Grinding grain to make bread for household consumption was likely the task of free women, bondwomen, or bondmen. On some large estates in Egypt, men first would crush grain in a mortar to make it ready for the women who then would grind it into flour. In ordinary peasant households, women likely performed all the procedures necessary for transforming grain into bread. In the Bible, grinding stones are associated with women (Judges 9:53); when young men carry them, the world has gone topsy-turvy (Lamentations 5:13). (See at
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-2">

   This instruction depicts the exodus from Egypt as the start of a new epoch in Israelite history and in the relationship of the Israelites with God.

   Rosh HaShanah, the first day of the seventh month, is now celebrated as the Jewish New Year; however, the Bible simply refers to it as a holiday commemorated with a shofar blast (see
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#l23-24">
    Leviticus 23:24
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#n29-1">
    Numbers 29:1

   The passover sacrifice is not a typical offering, for each family is to prepare, slaughter, and consume its own lamb (or kid—the Hebrew term applies to the young of both sheep and goats; see v. 5) as part of the offering. Some believe that this was an earlier apotropaic (or protective) custom that here becomes associated with the Exodus.

   Blood, as a vital force of life, has protective powers in biblical thought. Some scholars maintain that the blood is to be applied to the door-frame of the house to protect the point where evil might enter; therefore, no one is to pass through the doorway (v. 22). The blood must be applied to the doorway before nightfall so that the sign will be apparent to God, thus ensuring that the Israelites will remain safe.

   </i>
   No explanation is provided for the instruction to eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs along with the passover sacrifice. Hence, many scholars believe that this was a pre-existent custom that here becomes associated with the Exodus. The source of this custom is unknown, but many scholars associate the bitter herbs with a sharp seasoning that might have been used in ancient times. According to the Mishnah (
   <i>
    P’sachim
   </i>
   10:5) and the Passover Haggadah, the bitter herbs symbolize the bitterness of the enforced labor (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e1-14">
    Exodus 1:14
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Although the Bible does not give much information about food preparation, several texts (

    Genesis 18:6

   ; I Samuel 8:13; II Samuel 13:8; Ecclesiastes 12:3), as well as extra-biblical and ethnographic evidence, suggest that women usually prepared bread. See also at

   The instructions in this verse indicate that the Israelites are to be prepared for an imminent departure. A reference to speed appears again in vv. 33–34, which describe the Egyptians’ impatience for the Israelites to leave, and in v. 39, which links the unleavened bread to the Israelites’ hasty departure.

   This is the first time the word
   <i>

    matzot)
   </i>
   and the passover sacrifice (
   <i>
    pesach
   </i>
   ) originally were two distinct festivals; but there is no consensus regarding their origins. Here the Bible connects the two and links them to the Exodus experience (see also Joshua 5:11; Ezekiel 45:21; II Chronicles 35:17), thereby making them part of the rite of remembrance.

   The exact significance here of matzah is unclear. The Bible presents unleavened bread as both a festive food (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G19-1">

   The one who brings the plague is personified as an agent of God (see II Samuel 24:15–17; II Kings 19:32–37). Nonetheless, God’s control remains complete, for it is God who will “not let the Destroyer” enter the Israelites’ homes.

   The narrative may highlight these objects because the description of the unleavened cakes of dough baked on the journey out of Egypt (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.37-42">

   he drama of the hurried flight from Egypt is followed by various details about the start of the journey, including where the Israelites traveled, how many left, and when the exodus occurred.

     </a>
    </b>
   </i>
   The exact location of these cities, and therefore the route of the exodus itself, is unknown, perhaps because the biblical account is not an historical record but rather a story meant to dramatize and commemorate a formative experience.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">

   </i>
   This large number is symbolic, perhaps representing all Israelites of generations to come. If taken literally, the estimates for the total number of people leaving Egypt range between two and three million, assuming each man was accompanied by a wife and between two and three children. The number here agrees with the accounting in
   <a href="39_chapter_36.xhtml#n11-21">
    Numbers 11:21
   </a>
   , but note the discrepancy with the census account in
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#n26-51">
    Numbers 26:51
   </a>
   (see also
   <a href="26_chapter_23.xhtml#exo_38.21-31">

   As in
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e10-27">
    10:24

   , this term (Heb.
   <i>

   The significance of eating matzah is given here, even though the initial directive for eating it had been given in connection with the regulations for the Passover Festival (v. 8).

   It is impossible to reconcile this figure with the other dates for the sojourn in Egypt given in the Bible (see
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g15-13">
    Genesis 15:13
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g15-13">
    16
   </a>
   ). Large numbers like this need not be taken literally but can be read as indicating relative size (see at v. 37). In this case, the message conveyed is that the sojourn in Egypt lasted a long time. There is, as yet, not enough information available to posit any precise dating of the Exodus; any attempt to do so is, at best, speculation.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">

   This phrase indicates that the timing of the Exodus was either divinely preordained or miraculous. Either way, the implication is that God keeps all promises, thus continuing the theme of God’s ultimate control over all events.

    </b>
   </i>
   Heb.
   <i>
    shimurim
   </i>
   , literally “keeping watch,” contains the root
   <i>
    sh-m-r
   </i>
   , which occurs a total of seven times in
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-2">
    Exodus 12
   </a>
   (also “keep watch,” v. 6; “observe,” vv. 17 [twice], 24, 25). Just as God has kept watch to effectuate the Exodus, so the Israelites must vigilantly observe the various rites established to commemorate this extraordinary event. These rites are the subject of the remainder of the parashah.

   n returning to ritual considerations, the text now constructs a double frame around the climactic events just narrated. The first frame is focused on the passover sacrifice. The regulations enumerated earlier (vv. 3–6) discuss how the offering is to be prepared; here we are told who may partake of the offering and who is excluded. The topic of the second, outer frame is the importance of memory, a concern that not only began the parashah (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_10.1-29">
    10:2
   </a>
   ) but also appeared in the preparations for the

    Exodus (12:26–27)
   </a>
   ; here we find a listing of rites that institutionalize the memory of the Exodus and God’s redemptive power.

   This is the Torah’s first instance of this famous phrase, a depiction of Egypt that foreshadows the Decalogue (

   <i>
    kohein

   (priest). Following v. 2, above, this ceremony is performed only if the son is the first issue of his mother’s womb.

    O DESCRIBES
   </small>
   a number of rituals surrounding the Exodus that allow us to see a connection between blood, sacrifice, and family ties. Sacrificial blood in
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-2">
    12:1–13
   </a>
   is protective, separating the Egyptians who are about to die from the Israelites who soon will hurriedly flee the “house of bondage.” As an expression of the life force, the blood is also symbolic of the fertility of the family that offers it as a sacrifice and then applies it to the doorposts and the lintel of their house.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In addition, the blood symbolizes the connection between past and living generations. The living and the deceased should not be seen as mutually exclusive, but instead can be considered as part of a chain of human existence connecting ancestors and their descendants. Thus for readers of the story, the passover sacrifice acts as a link to generations past, a way to recognize the plight of those who first left Egypt and to offer gratitude to God for their liberation. The passover sacrifice also connects the past to the future, as one generation teaches the next the lessons of the Exodus: “And when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this rite?’ you shall say, ‘It is the passover sacrifice to
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   , who passed over the houses of the Israelites.…(
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-26">
    12:26–27
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Furthermore, the consumption of the communal Passover meal provides a map of the social structure of the family network. Eating the roasted lamb (or kid) with unleavened bread and bitter herbs determines the boundaries of the people who share in the event, indcating who is inside and outside the group. With all family groups eating their paschal lamb on the same evening (
   <a href="#exo_11.1-12.28">
    vv. 6–8
   </a>
   ), the act of eating becomes symbolic of continuity and unity. However, the separate groups consume their own sacrifices, “a lamb to a household” (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-2">
    12:3
   </a>
   ), with no foreigners allowed to eat of it (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.43-13.16">
    12:43–45
   </a>
   ). Thus, the rite also symbolizes discontinuity and differentiation. In these various ways, the Passover sacrificial ritual is about identity and how we solidify family ties through this ancient ritual.

   <i>
    P’sikta D’Rav Kahana

   7.9, Egyptian slave women were proud to work beside well-born Israelite women like Serah bat Asher, Jacob’s granddaughter (
   <a href="14_chapter_11.xhtml#g46-17">
    Genesis 46:17
   </a>
   ). Yet, despite their lowly status and their solidarity with Israelite slaves, the Torah makes clear that these women were still Egyptians—and their first-born children were not spared. According to midrashic tradition, Serah’s life spanned the entire period of Israel’s slavery in Egypt (see
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#n26-46">

   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#exo_32.1-35">
    Exodus 32
   </a>
   —they refused to participate in the sin of the Golden Calf (
   <i>
    Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer 45).
   </i>
   The custom of special time for women on Rosh Chodesh, which persisted through the Middle Ages, has been renewed today in Rosh Chodesh groups for women and girls.

   (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.29-36">
    12:29
   </a>
   ). Even though the Egyptians had already been tortured with nine plagues, they continued to force the Israelites to work as slaves. One of the well-known, back-breaking tasks of the slaves was making bricks (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e1-14">
    1:14
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e5-6">
    5:7
   </a>
   ). This involved the treading of clay to mix it with water and straw in order to prepare it for placing into molds to form bricks. A midrash in
   <i>
    Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer
   </i>
   48 recounts the story of a specific woman, Rachel the granddaughter of Shuthelah, who is not actually named in the Torah although her grandfather appears in a genealogical list (
   <a href="44_chapter_41.xhtml#n26-36">
    Numbers 26:36
   </a>
   ). At this late stage in the Egyptian bondage, Rachel was pregnant and was treading clay for bricks along with her husband. She spontaneously gave birth to her baby in the midst of her work, and the newborn mistakenly fell into the clay and was mixed into it. The new mother’s desperate cry was so great that it reached heaven. There, the angel Michael heard her, went down to earth, and took the clump of clay that had now been made into a brick with the infant inside it and brought it up to God’s Throne of Glory, where the brick served as God’s footstool. This outrage served as a reminder for God to proceed with the punishment of the Egyptians—and it was to that very same night that the present biblical verse refers.

   ). A rabbinic opinion states that first-born Egyptian females as well as males were killed in the tenth plague. According to this view, Pharaoh’s daughter—who had rescued Moses and raised him as her son (
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#E2-5">
    2:5–10
   </a>
   )—was a first-born and thus should have perished in this plague.
   <i>
    P’sikta D’Rav Kahana
   </i>
   7.7 explains that Moses prayed for his adoptive mother, whose name was thought to be Bithiah. His prayer is said to have extolled Bithiah in the language of Proverbs 31, the biblical tribute to the “woman of valor.” According to a verse in this poetic passage, the woman of valor’s lamp does not go out at night (Proverbs 31:18). The midrash understands this statement as a metaphorical reference to the survival of Pharaoh’s daughter, whose soul was not extinguished on the fateful night of death. Evidence is adduced from the unusual spelling of the Hebrew word for “night” as written in Proverbs 31:18 (without the final letter
   <i>
    heh),
   </i>
   which matches the spelling of a form of the same word in
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.41">
    Exodus 12:42
   </a>
   . Insisting on the connection between these two biblical verses, the midrash teaches that Pharaoh’s first-born daughter was saved during the tenth plague due to Moses’ prayer on her behalf.

    OD’S HARDENING OF

    HARAOH’S HEART
   </small>
   in
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_10.1-29">
    Exodus 10:1
   </a>
   presents a theological problem on two levels. First, if God is the agent of Pharaoh’s behavior, what does that imply about Pharaoh’s free will? Second, if God hardens Pharaoh’s heart in order to demonstrate God’s power, we must ask: At what price the Israelites’ liberation? Indeed, the ultimate result of Pharaoh’s stubbornness is the murder of every first-born Egyptian male. Even if we consider this to be retributive justice, payback for Pharaoh’s earlier order to kill all newborn Hebrew males, we still must ponder: Does one heinous crime justify another? And how do we come to terms with killing innocent children?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Commentators, equally bothered by this thorny moral dilemma, have provided inspired interpretations. With regard to the question of free will, some interpreters note that during the first five plagues, Pharaoh hardens his
   <i>
    own
   </i>
   heart. Only afterward does God take over, starting with the sixth plague (
   <a href="17_chapter_14.xhtml#e9-8">
    9:12
   </a>
   ), suggesting that Pharaoh has foregone the chance to operate independently. Modern psychoanalyst Erich Fromm writes, “The more man’s heart hardens, the less freedom he has to change; the more he is determined by previous action…there comes a point of no return, when man’s heart has become so hardened…that he has lost the possibility of freedom” (
   <i>
    You Shall Be as Gods,
   </i>
   1966, p. 101). This is an astute insight into human behavior, but it begs the question of the text’s plain meaning, which is that God causes Pharaoh’s stubbornness.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The hardening of Pharaoh’s heart might also be viewed as a paradigm for what Fran Burgess calls the “transformative power of adversity.” According to this view, Pharaoh’s stubborn resistance is the condition necessary for Moses and the Israelites to emerge from their straits (the Hebrew name for Egypt,
   <i>
    mitzrayim,
   </i>
   is very close to the Hebrew for “straits,”
   <i>
    metzarim).
   </i>
   Indeed, it often takes facing overwhelming odds to make radical change. As Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong said, “Before cancer, I just lived. Now I live strong.” Pharaoh thus serves as a tool for the Israelites’ psychological and moral development. However keen, this interpretation too satisfies only on the level of metaphor.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Perhaps the most satisfactory approach is to keep the theological problems ever-present. In
   <i>
    The Particulars of Rapture: Reflections on Exodus
   </i>
   (1995), Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg suggests that the liberation story of the Israelites, what she calls the “master narrative,” gives rise to “counter-narratives” that throw the justification of God’s triumphal power into question. Indeed, as Zornberg argues, the master narrative of God as loving and benevolent redeemer of the Israelites is challenged by the killing of the Egyptians’ first-born, including “the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon” (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.29-36">
    12:29
   </a>
   ). This prompts a counter-narrative from the perspective of the plague’s victims that asks: What sin could the babies and the captives possibly have committed to deserve this punishment? The answer posits an evil God. This narrative appears again later, in the story of the Golden Calf, when Moses convinces God not to murder the Israelites for their transgression, arguing that otherwise, the Egyptian story will prevail: “Let not the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he delivered them’” (
   <a href="24_chapter_21.xhtml#e32-12">
    32:12
   </a>
   ). Although the Midrash attempts to silence and “neutralize” potentially heretical answers to such queries, Zornberg maintains that “the Torah, even God’s quoted words, gives rise to interpretations that radically contradict its own master-narrative, and that cannot,
   <a id="page_375">
   </a>
   moreover, be totally repudiated by its accredited expositors” (p. 143).
  </div>
  <div class="image">

  </div>
  <div class="sidebar1">
   <i>

    </b>
   </i>
  </div>
  <div class="image0">
   <img alt="images" src="../Images/border.jpg"/>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   For Zornberg, an alternative for dealing with the dissonance between narrative and counter-narrative is “the model of endless questioning, in which the answer does not totally silence the questioner” (p. 143). In fact, implicit and explicit questions play an important role in this parashah. God mandates that the story of the Exodus be told in response to children’s queries: “And when your children ask you…, you shall say..(
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-26">
    12:26–27
   </a>
   ). This is the basis for the Passover
   <i>
    seder
   </i>
   ’s custom of the Four Questions. Further, two more verses from this parashah and one from Deuteronomy instruct us to answer our children’s questions about the Exodus. The Rabbis understood all these verses as referring to four kinds of children, the Haggadah’s Four Sons, each with varying aptitudes, each eliciting a different perspective on the narrative: the Wise Son (
   <a href="48_chapter_45.xhtml#deu6-20">
    Deuteronomy 6:20–21
   </a>
   ), the Wicked Son (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#E12-26">
    Exodus 12:26
   </a>
   ), the Simple Son (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e13-14">
    13:14
   </a>
   ), and the One Who Is Unable to Ask (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#e13-8">
    13:8
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Through questions, we might call forth another counter-narrative: the experience of women during the exodus and its subsequent retelling. Noting that the traditional Haggadah assumes a conversation between a father and four sons, contemporary feminist Haggadot fill in for the absence of women’s voices. The
   <i>
    Ma’yan Haggadah
   </i>
   , for example, includes the Four Daughters. The daughter “in search of a usable past” asks, “Why did Moses say at Sinai, ‘Go not near a woman,’ addressing only men, as if preparation for revelation was not meant for us, as well?” The daughter “who wants to erase her difference” wonders about the importance of women’s issues. The daughter “who does not know that she has a place at the table” asks, “What is this?” And the daughter “who asks no questions” is told: “From the moment Yocheved, Miriam, and the midwives questioned Pharaoh’s edict until today, every question we ask helps us leave Egypt a little farther behind” (Tamara Cohen, Sue Levi Elwell, and Ronnie Horn, eds.,
   <i>
    The Journey Continues: Ma’yan Passover Haggadah
   </i>
   , 1997).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Just as the women defied Pharaoh, so we too as readers must confront and challenge troubling aspects of our sacred narratives. The persistent hardening of Pharaoh’s heart results in the Israelites’ night of redemption, but we must never forget that this same night was one of horror for the Egyptians. We must continue to ask the questions that preserve our awareness of the Other’s story. Did the Israelites hear the
   <i>
    tzaakah
   </i>
   (cry) of the Egyptians (
   <a href="18_chapter_15.xhtml#exo_12.29-36">
    12:30
   </a>
   )? Did it remind them of their own cry—the
   <i>
    tzaakah
   </i>
   in
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e3-7">
    3:7
   </a>
   , which brought God’s attention to their plight? Year after year, as we recall at our seder table the wonders God performed for us, we must remember the price the Other paid for our liberation.
