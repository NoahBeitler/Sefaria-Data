   (“And he sent”) features Jacob—the third and final patriarch—as he becomes the last individual to receive a personal covenant with God. In a life-transforming event, Jacob meets God face to face, and his name is changed to “Israel,” which may reflect his own struggles with God. After Jacob, all future covenant renewals will be made between God and
   <i>
    B’nei Yisrael
   </i>
   (literally “the children of [the patriarch] Israel”)—the Israelites as a whole, who will continue the struggle.

   All of the women in this parashah (except for those in the genealogy of Esau in
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_35.1-36.43">
    Genesis 36
   </a>
   ) are members of Jacob’s immediate family. What stands out is the troubling story of Dinah and Shechem (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
    Genesis 34
   </a>
   ), although Dinah’s role in the narrative is revealingly minor. While she functions as a trigger for the event, the tale focuses on the relations between the men of the family of Jacob and the Canaanites among whom they have settled. The major concern in the story as told is not the personal fate of an individual woman (or man) but the political relationship between Israel and the other inhabitants in the land. Dinah becomes a symbol in the exploration of the theme of identity—of self and of other—that began with the story of Abraham.

  <div class="tab-en1">
   The other women in Jacob’s household appear in passing in this parashah, with Rachel’s death as a poignant conclusion. In general, these passages enable us to view the women of the story as intermediaries linking together groups of men, while moving about in the social world of the male characters—who have the authority to represent both the women and the subordinate men in their households.

     Jacob was terrified. So anxious was he, that he divided the people who were with him—and the flocks, the herds, and the camels—into two camps.
     <sup>

     He thought: “If Esau advances on the first camp and strikes it, the remaining camp will be able to escape.”
     <sup>

     Then Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac,

     After spending the night there, he chose an offering for his brother Esau from what was at hand—

   ven before birth, Jacob was portrayed as a character who struggles. He struggled in the womb (25:22). He struggled with Esau for birthright and blessing (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_25.1-18">
    Genesis 25
   </a>
   and
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_27.1-28.9">
    27
   </a>
   ). After twenty years of living in Aram he struggled with Laban (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_30.25-31.42">
    Genesis 31
   </a>
   ) and, ever since he has headed back toward the land of Canaan, he has been facing a potentially dangerous encounter with his estranged brother Esau. Now, on the way home, Jacob endures a physical confrontation with God—and as a result, has his name changed to Israel. The struggle between humans and God is a prevalent theme in the Hebrew Bible that culminates not with Jacob/Israel, but with
   <i>
    B’nei Yisrael,
   </i>
   his descendants—who continually engage in either avoidance of, or confrontation with, their God.

  <div class="tab-en1">
   According to the preceding narrative, Jacob had wronged his brother, Esau, and then left home (27:1–28:5). Now Esau comes to meet Jacob with four hundred men, and Jacob is terrified. Jacob responds by making use of his two greatest assets: a wily mind, and God’s covenant with his ancestors.

   Jacob’s prayer (vv. 10–13) is one of the few prayers recorded in the narrative books of the Bible. (Another is Hannah’s prayer of victory; I Samuel 2.) The prayer opens and closes with direct allusions to God’s covenant with Abraham (vv. 10 and 13).

   Forms of the word “face” (Heb.
   <i>
    panim)
   </i>
   occur seven times in this passage (at times translated as “in front of” or “ahead of”), providing a verbal link to the life-altering theme in the events that are about to occur. The repetition conveys the force of this moment in Jacob’s life and of all that he must face—including his brother. Two encounters, first with his God and then with his brother, will be united when he eventually says to Esau, “I’ve seen your face—like seeing God’s face!” (33:10).

   In Hosea 12:5–6, the prophet states specifically that Jacob “strove with a divine being (
   <i>
    elohim

   ); he strove with an angel
   <i>

   The original meaning of this twopart name cannot be stated definitively. In most cases,
   <i>
    el
   </i>
   is a noun meaning “God,” but sometimes it has a more general sense of “divine” or “superlative.” Also unclear is whether
   <i>
    el
   </i>
   is subject or object of the name’s verbal portion, which itself is ambiguous. Thus this name can be construed as “he struggles with God,” or “God struggles,” or “God rules,” or “his struggle is mighty,” and more. The present story turns on the first of those possible meanings.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   A name change often signifies a change in character. Jacob is no longer simply the “deceiver/supplanter” (27:36). Abraham and Sarah have their names changed permanently and consistently (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_17.1-27">
    Genesis 17

   After his encounter with God, Jacob turns back to the confrontation with his brother, Esau. He divides the women and children, situating the women most likely according to personal preference: maids and their children first, then Leah and her children, and then, Rachel and Joseph—his favorites—in back. The status of Jacob’s sons depends apparently upon their mothers’ favor with Jacob, not their birth order or even their personalities. Joseph is the only child specifically cited. These spatial and narrative details spotlight Jacob’s preference of Rachel, an attitude that later proves to undermine harmony within the household.

   SEX AND SOCIAL STATUS (34:1-31)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en">
   <span class="dropcap-s">

   </span>
   inah, acting independently and of her own initiative, goes out to visit “the women of the locality.” In the span of just two verses, the local Hivite prince, Shechem, spots Dinah, has sex with her, falls in love with her, and wants to marry her. Her brothers react violently and destroy Shechem and his city.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Dinah’s status and her standing in society steadily decline as the story progresses. She moves from fulfilling the proper role in the proper place (virgin-daughter in father’s house) to a socially ambiguous role with no proper corresponding physical place. Her story serves as a warning in the larger—and probably overriding—issue of the political and ethnic identity of the Israelites in relation to the other people in the land.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Throughout the story, Dinah’s location corresponds directly to her perceived position in society and illustrates the precarious state of the daughter in biblical Israel. Though she seems free to move about, she is not secure anywhere. One need only consider the plight of Jephthah’s daughter in Judges 11, the concubine in Judges 19, and the daughters of Shiloh in Judges 21, to get the message that women, or at least daughters, are vulnerable to calamity when they “go out.”
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="ge_vv.1-4">
   RAPE? (34:1–4)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   A crucial question for modern interpreters is whether or not Dinah was raped. When considering the modern concept of rape—characterized by an aggressive act and lack of mutual consent—there is little question as to what happens to Dinah; the author tells us that Shechem saw her, took her, lay with her, and humiliated her. To us, this string of verbs screams “rape” (and is in fact even translated that way in v. 2). The assumption made by most interpreters is that Dinah did not consent to the sexual act. However, the question of consent, so central to the modern notion of rape and of women’s rights in general, is entirely ignored in this text. Dinah’s consent is not the issue. The ambiguity of the Hebrew verbs describing Shechem’s actions toward Dinah compounds the difficulty of interpretation.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   If we contemporary interpreters are sensitive to the ancient context in which the story was recorded, we need to entertain the possibility that there is a fundamental difference between our modern concept of rape and what may represent rape in the biblical text. In our society, forcing a woman to have sex against her will is seen as terrible both for its emotional and psychological consequences, and for the humiliation and debasement suffered by the woman as an individual. The Bible, even in its rape laws, was primarily concerned with the juridical and social-status consequences of the tort involved in sleeping with a virgin without either marrying her or compensating her father. As with adultery, the problem was not treated as an emotional or psychological one. When Amnon rapes Tamar in II Samuel 13, the violation that has taken place is made clear when Tamar begs Amnon not to reject her but to request her for his wife. It is his rejection subsequent to the sexual act that damages Tamar’s life the most, because as an unmarried non-virgin princess, she has completely lost status in her society. In contrast to Tamar, Dinah is not granted a voice in the story; instead, her body and life form a site for settling issues between men.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   If Shechem marries Dinah after having sex with her, she would have full status as a wife in his household. The story, however, aims at excluding such a union with the other peoples in the land. Thus Jacob ignores his obligation to protect the women of his household when he does not subsequently negotiate Dinah’s marriage to Shechem. (For a different perspective on this episode, see

   Dinah goes out of her father’s house to a public space, literally “to see the daughters of the land.” Dinah seems free to leave, but she does so at her own risk. She is going out to “see” her peers, but she is ultimately “seen”—with dramatic consequences. Nowhere in the text is she criticized for her action.

   Interpretive debates about the story and its import revolve around the meaning of the word

  <div class="tab-en1">
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_21.22-22.12">
    Deuteronomy 22
   </a>
   contains several laws about sexual offenses with terminology similar to what appears here. From the usage in Deuteronomy one can conclude that
   <i>
    innah
   </i>
   means “violate,” not “rape” (
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#D22-23">
    22:23–24
   </a>
   ). The expression “he took hold of her”
   <i>
    is
   </i>
   apparently the one used for rape in
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu_22.13-29">
    Deuteronomy (22:25)
   </a>
   as well in the Tamar/Amnon story (II Samuel 13:14)—and it is not used here in the present verse. Consequently, the word
   <i>
    innah
   </i>
   should not be translated as rape, and what happened to Dinah certainly should not be understood as an act of rape in the modern sense of the word. Rather, the term demonstrates in this passage, as elsewhere, a downward movement in a social sense, meaning to “debase” or “humiliate” (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_16.1-16">
    Genesis 16:6
   </a>
   ). Though an affront to the woman’s family, the term does not carry with it the psychological and emotional implications for the woman that the contemporary notion of rape suggests. In this particular text, the woman has no voice, and the narrator has no interest in whether or not she consented to the sexual act. Bear in mind that according to ancient Near Eastern mores, Dinah would have been considered to have been disgraced even if she had consented.

   Jacob hears what has happened to Dinah and, somewhat uncharacteristically, waits until the return of his sons. There is irony here in that on the Canaanite side the son (Shechem) goes to his father (Hamor) to negotiate on his behalf, while Jacob remains silent throughout the entire story until v. 30, when he chastises his sons for having made trouble for him in his new land.

Something defiled can often be rendered pure with proper ritual purification. In the case of Dinah, it appears that marriage to Shechem could potentially change her status from “defiled” to “pure.”

   Entering into a binding marriage requires both negotiation and sex (not necessarily in that order); so Dinah and Shechem are already halfway there. For their part of the negotiation, the brothers tell Shechem that they cannot give Dinah to him in marriage until he is circumcised. In a surprising move, Shechem is able to convince the males of the town to become circumcised in order to benefit from contact with Jacob’s family.

   BROTHERS’ REVENGE (34:25–31)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Rather than framing their sister’s loss of virginity in the context of marriage, “Jacob’s sons” had arranged marriage deceptively (v. 13). Rather than following through with the terms they had negotiated, Simeon and Levi—now also identified as “Dinah’s brothers” (v. 25)—exact revenge.

    </b>
   </i>
   After her initial encounter with Shechem, Dinah does not return to her father’s house. But in Shechem’s house, her status is equally problematic as she is not officially his wife. An alien in a foreign household, lacking a negotiated marriage and children, Dinah is literally on the social fringe. Her removal from Shechem’s house at this point in the story does nothing to improve the situation. With a voided marriage but the sexual status of wife, there is no acceptable place for her in society.

   The brothers choose to view the offer of money in compensation for Dinah’s virginity not as an elevation of her status, but rather as a statement about Dinah’s availability as a prostitute. Their explanation for their behavior makes clear that Dinah herself is not culpable. This position stands in stark contrast to tendencies in the ancient (and modern) world to blame the woman for the family’s shame.

   The story in vv. 9–15 is a doublet on the name change from Jacob to Israel (32:17–33), one of several episodes in the Torah that appear twice in similar form (see the sister/wife story of Abraham and Sarah in

   RACHEL’S SECOND SON AND HER DEATH (35:16–21)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   On the road from Beth El, Rachel dies in childbirth. Earlier, when Laban had charged Jacob with stealing the household gods (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#ge_30.25-31.42">
    Genesis 31
   </a>
   ), Jacob had countered, “the one with whom you find your gods shall not live” (31:32). It is unclear whether according to the text’s composer(s) Rachel’s death is an unwitting result of Jacob’s rash curse (after all, Laban did not find his household gods). Deaths during childbirth were a widespread phenomenon in the ancient world. Rachel’s demise may implicitly be connected to her former barrenness and desperate attempts to have a child. Ironically, the woman who so longed for children dies in childbirth.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   This is one of only two stories in the Bible about such deaths. In the other (I Samuel 4:18–22), a woman’s premature labor is triggered by the shock of Israel’s defeat in war and of the deaths of her father-in-law and husband; and she, like Rachel, dies after naming the child (but see at 30:3).

   Rachel—who embedded her longing for another son already in the name of her first son, Joseph (30:24)—is dying; but her midwife tries to comfort her with the knowledge that she is giving up her life for a living (male) child. A similar attempt at comfort is recorded in I Samuel 4:18.

   </i>
   According to I Samuel 10:2, the tomb of Rachel was in the territory of (or at the boundary of) Benjamin, as might be expected, and not near Bethlehem, which is in Judah. In Jeremiah 31:15, Rachel weeps for her children in Ramah, a city in Benjamin. The later status accorded to Bethlehem under David’s influence might account for the present note that Rachel’s tomb was near Bethlehem. According to the biblical accounts, Rachel is the only one of the four matriarchs not buried in the cave of Machpelah, purchased by Abraham for Sarah (
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_23.1-20">
    Genesis 23
   </a>
   )—which is also Jacob’s final resting place (50:13). Such perpetual separation is sadly ironic, given his intense love for Rachel.

   Just as he had set up a pillar to commemorate his encounter with God (35:14), Jacob sets up one to mark Rachel’s grave. Although no emotions are expressed here, on his deathbed Jacob will poignantly recall this loss and burial (48:7).

   ). Intercourse with the father’s concubine, although a less severe offense than with his wife, is apparently tantamount to a declaration of rebellion against the father. When Adonijah asks for Abishag, the woman who shared David’s bed when he was old (I Kings 1:1–4), Solomon takes this as a bid for the throne, and has Adonijah executed for treason (I Kings 2:13–25).

   As with Dinah in

The mothers’ mention presumably indicates the relative status of the sons. The mothers are listed in a different order than seen previously. In 33:2, fearing Esau’s wrath, Jacob had placed the maids Bilhah and Zilpah and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and her son closest to the rear. That order reflects their importance to Jacob, from the most to the least expendable. Here, the women’s order corresponds to the order in which Jacob married them: Leah; Rachel; Rachel’s maid, Bilhah; and Leah’s maid, Zilpah.

   This section provides the genealogy of Esau’s line. Esau’s Canaanite wives figure prominently. While the women in Jacob’s list above are mentioned only in connection with their sons, Esau’s wives are identified by the name and ethnicity of their fathers. Esau acquires power by establishing a series of marriage alliances corresponding to the later relationship of the nation Edom with these other nations. Here the movement of women from the house of their father to the house of their husband serves to establish political and social relations between two groups of previously unrelated men.

    AYISHLACH BEGINS AND ENDS
   </small>
   with references to Esau, Jacob’s twin brother. At the beginning of this parashah, it is to Esau whom Jacob sends messengers (32:4), who return with a report that he is on the move, coming to meet his brother (32:7). The parashah concludes with Esau going to another region “because of his brother Jacob” (36:6–8) and with Esau’s genealogical line, the Edomite people (36:9–42).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Esau is thus highlighted in this parashah by being the subject of the beginning and ending units. Even so, Jacob is clearly the more important character—a fate Esau has had to endure from early on. Esau is a touching figure because no matter how hard he tries, he cannot measure up to his younger brother who—though not always honest and fair in his dealings—outmaneuvers him.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   What distinguishes the two brothers? How to account for Jacob’s prominence over Esau? The difference between the two begins with their mother’s decision and continues with their choices of marriage partners. God informs Rebekah—not Isaac—about their yet-to-be-born twins that “the older shall serve the younger” (25:23). Rebekah acts on this information by supporting Jacob at the expense of her other son.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Then Esau marries two Hittite women, causing his parents distress (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#ge_26.34-35">
    26:34–35
   </a>
   ), whereas Jacob is sent (at his mother’s instigation) to find a wife from her own people (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G28-1">
    27:46–28:5
   </a>
   ), which he does (
   <a href="10_chapter_07.xhtml#G29-21">
    29:21–30
   </a>
   ). Attempting to please his parents, Esau tries again by marrying Mahalath, also a cousin like Jacob’s wives; she is the daughter of Ishmael, his father’s brother (
   <a href="09_chapter_06.xhtml#G28-8">
    28:8–9
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The Dinah story occurs in the middle, in between the references to Esau that frame this parashah. After Shechem—a Canaanite prince—rapes Jacob’s daughter, Jacob is indecisive about their marriage (34:5). Dinah’s two oldest full brothers, however, respond by killing all the Shechemites so that the marriage between Dinah and Shechem does not happen, thereby keeping their sister from marrying the people in the land.

Thus—based on her involvement with Shechem—Dinah is identified as the otherwise unnamed “Canaanite woman” who was the mother of Simeon’s son Saul (46:10). It was also taught that when she died, Simeon buried her in Canaan.

   <i>
    Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer
   </i>
   38 states that Dinah became pregnant when raped by Shechem, and she bore a daughter. Afraid of the shame that the presence of this child would bring on their community, Dinah’s brothers sought to kill the infant. Jacob, however, put an amulet with the name of God around the girl’s neck and sent her away; she was taken by the archangel Michael to Egypt, where she was adopted by a childless Egyptian priest and raised as his daughter. Dinah’s daughter, “Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On” (
   <a href="13_chapter_10.xhtml#ge_41.1-57">

   ), later became Joseph’s wife.

Asenath tossed her amulet and when Joseph saw it, he realized their relationship and married her (

     Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died…and was buried…under the…Oak of Weeping
    </b>
   </i>
   (35:8). The word
   <i>
    bachut,
   </i>
   “weeping,” is similar to the plural term
   <i>
    b’chiyot,
   </i>
   “weepings,” suggesting to the Rabbis that
   <i>
    two
   </i>
   deaths were being mourned here: the death of Deborah, and the death of Rebekah—an event not otherwise mentioned in the Torah. According to
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   81.5, this is why the next verse (35:9) relates that
   <i>
    God appeared to Jacob…and blessed him
   </i>
   : God performed the kindness of visiting and comforting Jacob while he mourned his mother. But why is Rebekah’s death not related directly? Midrash
   <i>
    Tanchuma, Ki Teitzei
   </i>
   4, explains that it was impossible to have an honorable funeral for her. Abraham was dead; Isaac, blind and weakened, could not leave his tent; and Jacob had gone abroad and could not return in time. Only Esau remained, and the continued ill feeling between him and his mother made it unlikely that he would come. Because Rebekah’s life ended in such a lonely way, the Torah hints at her passing only obliquely (see also the medieval commentator Ramban on 35:8).

   <i>
    <b>
     as her life was leaving her…she named him Benoni, but his father called him Benjamin

   </i>
   (35:18). Commentators generally agree that by the word
   <i>
    oni,
   </i>
   Rachel meant “my pain” or “my sorrow.” Rabbi Moses ben Nachman (1194–1270)—usually known as “Nachmanides” or by his initials as “Ramban”— notes here that another meaning of
   <i>
    on
   </i>
   is “strength,” as in 49:3, in which Jacob blesses Reuben as “first fruit of my vigor (
   <i>
    reishit oni).”
   </i>
   So too
   <i>
    y’min,
   </i>
   the right hand,
   <a id="page_204">
   </a>
   stands for strength in the biblical world. Thus, Jacob does not actually change the name given by Rachel—for all Jacob’s children bear names given to them by their mothers—but rather “translates” it to its most positive interpretation.

    FTER TWENTY YEARS
   </small>
   , Jacob is coming home. Anticipating that the reunion with the brother he cheated all those years ago will be disastrous, he sends messengers laden with presents ahead to his brother. But just to be on the safe side, he divides his camp in order to minimize the losses should he come under attack. The story continues: “That same night, he got up, took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven children, and crossed at a ford of the Jabbok [river].…Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him” (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#G32-23">
    32:23–25
   </a>
   ). The nocturnal wrestler wounds and blesses him and gives him a new name—our name: Yisrael, one who wrestles with God.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Jacob’s wrestling with God is a powerful image and legacy. We never know with whom Jacob is wrestling: is it himself, his conscience, his brother, God, or all of these parts of himself and of his life? Jacob names the place Peniel, meaning “Face of God,” for, as he states, “I have seen God face-to-face” (32:31). Somehow, alone, separated from his “two wives” and his “eleven children,” Jacob discovers the face of God in his adversary—and Jacob is blessed.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1" style="margin-top:1em;">
   Eleven children cross the river? But Jacob already at this point has twelve children. What about Dinah, his daughter? What happened to her? Rashi, quoting a midrash, explains: “He placed her in a chest and locked her in.” While many commentaries understand that by locking Dinah in a box Jacob intends to protect her from marrying his brother Esau, we know the truth of the story. Hiding Dinah—locking her up—is a powerful image about silencing a woman. And that silence echoes loudly through the rest of the Torah.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   What happens next? Dinah gets raped (
   <a href="11_chapter_08.xhtml#ge_34.1-31">
    Genesis 34
   </a>
   ). In an ultimate act of silencing, the commentaries understand Dinah’s rape as Jacob’s punishment for withholding her from Esau. Dinah’s rape is
   <i>
    Jacob’s
   </i>
   punishment? What about Dinah? What has she done? How does she feel? Our text is silent. We only know what her brothers and father think: that she has been defiled (34:5–7), that she must not be treated as a whore (34:31). No one in the Torah or the midrashic accounts asks her what she wants, what she needs, or how she can be comforted.

   Her silence is loud enough to reverberate through the generations. We hear it in the reports of other fathers who perceive their daughter’s rape as their dishonor, their punishment. Fortunately for Dinah, in Genesis the blame and punishment fall entirely on the perpetrator and his people, not on her. Other women are not as lucky. In 1998, in Pakistan, Arbab Khatoon was raped by three men in a village in Jacobabad district. She was murdered seven hours later. According to local residents, she was killed by her relatives for bringing dishonour to the family by going to the police. In 1999, Lal Jamilla Mandokhel, a 16-year-old mentally retarded girl, was reportedly raped several
   <a id="page_205">
   </a>
   times by a junior clerk of the local government department of agriculture in a hotel in Parachinar, Pakistan. The girl’s uncle filed a complaint about the incident with police—who took the accused into protective custody but then handed over the girl to her tribe. The elders decided that she had brought shame to her tribe and that the honor could only be restored by her death; she was killed in front of a tribal gathering.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Similar stories are reported not only in Pakistan but also in Bangladesh, Great Britain, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Pakistan, Morocco, Sweden, Turkey, Uganda—as well as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. No wonder women are silent!
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   This outrage is only part of a much larger problem of violence against women. For example, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund
   <small>
    (UNICEF),
   </small>
   more than five thousand brides die annually in India because their dowries are considered insufficient. Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, says that “in countries where Islam is practiced, they’re called honor killings, but dowry deaths and so-called crimes of passion have a similar dynamic in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable.” The practice, she said, “goes across cultures and across religions.” In the few cases when public outcry around the world and international pressure were used, a woman’s life was spared. But stories that capture the headlines do not begin to address the scope and range of the problem.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Another form that violence takes is sexual slavery and human trafficking, which even happens in Israel. According to a recent Knesset report, thousands of women are illegally smuggled into Israel and sold into sexual slavery. These young women—typically in their early twenties—are raped, abused, incarcerated and threatened, “servicing” 15–25 clients over 14–18 hours a day, 7 days a week. The women become indentured slaves with an ever-growing debt to their owners. Israeli men from all walks of life pay approximately a million visits to brothels per month and the profits from this illicit activity are estimated at $750 million annually. Sexual slavery and human trafficking remain a global problem, taking place in nearly every corner of the world. It is estimated that 600,000–800,000 people—mostly women and children—are trafficked across borders worldwide every year. (For ways to get information—and to get involved in this issue—please contact the Task Force on Human Trafficking through its Web site.)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   We hear Dinah’s silence as well in the challenges to reproductive rights happening right now in the United States. If Dinah were raped and became pregnant while living in South Dakota in 2007, she might not be able to get an abortion.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   What happens to Dinah in the aftermath of her ordeal? We do not know. We never hear from her, just as we may never hear from the women and girls in our generation who are victims of violence and whose voices are not heard. But the legacy of Jacob as Israel, the one who wrestles, demands that we confront the shadowy parts of ourselves and our world—and not passively ignore these facts. The feminist educator Nelle Morton urged women to hear each other “into speech.” Dinah’s story challenges us to go even further and be also the voices for all of our sisters.
