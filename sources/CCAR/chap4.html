   (“[he] appeared”) describes several encounters between God and members of Abraham’s household. In one sense, this parashah recounts the birth and survival of the next generation, Isaac and Rebekah: it begins with the announcement of Sarah’s forthcoming pregnancy and Isaac’s forthcoming birth (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 18
   </a>
   ), continues with the challenges that stand in the way of the future, and concludes with Rebekah, Isaac’s future wife (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_22.20-24">
    22:20–24
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Questions of identity and self-definition continue, as covenantal blessings demarcate the distinction between Sarah and Isaac on the one hand, and Hagar and Ishmael on the other. A subtext concerns Abraham’s role in fulfilling God’s plan. But the individual episodes do more than chart the hazards and successes that follow God’s promises of progeny and land (see the previous parashah). Rather, they vividly depict the challenges, anguish, and joy that human beings experience as they create families and discover the complexities of multiple commitments.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The most famous of these episodes is the “Binding of Isaac,” where Abraham is asked to sacrifice his beloved son (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_21.22-22.19">
    Genesis 22
   </a>
   ). This story has its counterpart in that of a mother with an imperiled child: the heart-wrenching story of Hagar and Ishmael in the wilderness (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 21
   </a>
   ), in which Hagar despairs of her son’s survival. Women are prominent through-out. At long last Sarah learns that she shall have a son (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 18
   </a>
   ), and finally becomes a mother (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 21
   </a>
   ). Tension between two mothers—Sarah and Hagar—each one seeking the welfare of her child, frames the story of Lot’s daughters, who act together (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 19
   </a>
   ). These tales offer glimpses into women’s world and presumed concerns. The closing report about Rebekah’s birth far from the land of Canaan sets the stage for when she becomes Isaac’s wife (in the next parashah).

   Sarah is 90 years old. It is the hottest part of the day and she is expected to do the baking. Is this because Abraham recognizes the importance of these visitors and Sarah’s involvement raises the level of the meal? (On women as bakers, see at

   Since Abraham already knows that Sarah will have a son (

   For the first time, Sarah learns about her forthcoming pregnancy. Some use this verse to criticize Sarah for listening to other people’s conversations.

   Sarah no longer menstruates, also meaning that she can no longer conceive. The reference highlights for the reader why she will be surprised by what she hears. [Rachel also refers to menstruation as “the way of women” (

   The word

   Sarah’s reaction reflects her delighted surprise in her husband’s abilities. God suggests a different reason (v. 13). This implies that Abraham and Sarah had stopped sexual relations, highlighting why the visitors inform her that the couple should renew them. Sarah does not doubt the Deity’s abilities, but rather Abraham’s.

   Some interpreters have concluded, erroneously, that Sarah’s laughter was derisive. When Abraham heard that he would have a child with Sarah, he “fell flat on his face and laughed, thinking: ‘Can a child be born to a man of 100? Can 90-year-old Sarah bear a child?’” (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g17-17">
    17:17
   </a>
   ). Thus Sarah is actually now accused of Abraham’s earlier actions. Since Sarah is alone in the tent when she laughs, is the Deity testing Abraham to determine if he will admit his own actions and protect Sarah? | [Tikva Frymer-Kensky, who considers Sarah’s laughter as an expression of doubt, interprets God’s response to Sarah this way: “God ignores Abraham’s laughter but reacts to Sarah’s. After all, Sarah should understand how important she is.…Sarah’s importance in God’s scheme means that God will have zero tolerance for skepticism from her” (

   Whom does Sarah fear? Most interpreters assume that Sarah is afraid of God. I contend that she fears Abraham. Sarah has no reason to fear God—who apparently comes to her rescue (in the house of the pharaoh,
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.10-14.24">

   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#G12-14">

   Lot offers his daughters instead of the men.

   Lot’s daughters become mothers of nations that—through him—are related to the line of Abraham. Fearful that humankind has been annihilated, the daughters (the same ones whom Lot offered to the town’s men earlier?) take drastic measures to perpetuate life. Like Tamar (see

   he tension in the family does not end with Isaac’s birth, since there are potential threats to his longevity and success from both his brother and his father.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   One of the most poignant parts of the parashah is the story of two mothers, each of whom desires the well-being of her son. Mother Sarah seeks to secure her infant’s future (a future that she will probably not live to see, given her age) by expelling a rival. Hagar then faces the near death of her son. The Torah is sympathetic to both mothers caught in the cross-currents.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The plight here of mother Hagar and son Ishmael will be mirrored by that of father Abraham and his son Isaac in the story immediately following. Certain details connect the stories: In both, the parent rises early, a child is imperiled; and a divine messenger intervenes at the last moment. (Both stories are read on Rosh HaShanah in traditional synagogues.)

   Ishmael’s precise action is at issue. All we know for sure is that it triggers a severe reaction in Sarah. The word
   <i>
    m’tzachek
   </i>
   (“playing”) puns on the name Isaac (

    </b>
   </i>
   [From a feminist perspective, the call for the expulsion of Hagar raises troubling questions. The story portrays the oppression of one woman by another; it also places responsibility for the enmity between two peoples—the descendants of Isaac and those of Ishmael—upon women, especially Sarah. As a story about domestic relations, the narrative builds sympathy for Hagar at Sarah’s expense. Some scholars respond by pointing out that Sarah’s concern is legitimate. As an old woman she anticipates her young son’s vulnerable position in the event of her death. She takes steps to protect him by removing the competition for Abraham’s possessions—and possibly also for his affection. Rather than casting a human drama in simplistic terms, the story of Sarah, Hagar, and Abraham poignantly illustrates the dilemma of multiple commitments. Among other things, this passage may seek to sensitize the reader to the plight of the outsider. —

    </b>
   </i>
   Sarah raises inheritance as the issue, stressing meanwhile that Hagar is a slave. In
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#g17-17">
    17:19
   </a>
   , God had earmarked Isaac to receive the covenantal promise, and perhaps Sarah is acting with that knowledge. Ancient law collections from Mesopotamia address inheritance in similar cases, illustrating ancient customs that may lie in the background of this story. In the collection of Lipit Ishtar, the status of the second wife determines whether or not her son inherits. In the collection of Hammurabi, a child of a slave inherits only if the father claims him. The sons of Zilpah and Bilhah—women of a status similar to Hagar—do later inherit along with the children of the primary wives, Leah and Rachel. Perhaps Sarah objects to such an arrangement because her son is so young and she may not be around to protect him.

   The text does not clarify what “this” is, or specify which son he refers to; therefore what bothers Abraham is open to interpretation. One might suppose here that Abraham is not concerned about Hagar, but God’s response in the next verse (“do not be grieved…over your slave”) implies otherwise.

   Abraham’s negotiations over wells near Beersheba seemingly have little to do with Ishmael or Isaac; yet this new residence is on the edge of the desert, not far from where the text just left Hagar and Ishmael (v. 21). Meanwhile, it is the same town to which Abraham will go (

   andwiched between the binding of Isaac and Sarah’s death (in the next parashah) is a paragraph concerning Rebekah’s family. This parashah ends with Isaac safe, and with his future wife born to the right woman from the right lineage. Rebekah, the matriarch for the next generation, appears immediately before the previous one, Sarah, dies. This passage emphasizes the women in the lineage and highlights the importance of women in the “patriarchal” line of the people of Israel. On the role of women in the Israelite lineage, see also at

   We were told of her marriage to Nahor when she was first introduced with Sarai (11:29), before Abram’s household left the city of Haran for Canaan. Now she is mentioned again—and once more in verse 23—just before Sarah dies (23:1–2). Rebekah will also mention her grandmother Milcah when she identifies herself (24:24, 47).

    IKE THE PRECEDING PARASHAH
   </small>
   , this one frames the theme of generational and genealogical continuity as a male affair. Women are constructed largely as sexual objects and procreative instruments with mostly a physical and corporeal relationship to the story of threatened birth and threatened survival. The two wife-sister episodes—in
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.10-14.24">
    Genesis 12:10–20
   </a>
   and (in our parashah)
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G20-1">
    20:2–18
   </a>
   —present Sarai/Sarah as a silent object of desire. Sarah is taken by Abimelech, king of Gerar, and later returned to her husband—as, one may say, a possession—while her husband is amply compensated for the king’s error. In her role as barren wife, she is a figure discussed by, rather than addressed directly by, God, who questions her skeptical laughter (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#g18-12">
    18:12–14
   </a>
   ). The announcement of a male child is not transmitted by God to Sarah, but rather to Abraham, as she eavesdrops on the conversation at the entrance of the tent (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#g18-12">
    18:10
   </a>
   ). As a mother, however, Sarah is validated by God, who advises Abraham to obey her demand that her rival, Hagar, and Hagar’s son, Ishmael, be removed from the household (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G21-10">
    21:12
   </a>
   ). Yet, beyond her protective role as mother, Sarah is neither consulted nor even mentioned in the story of the great test of faith that Abraham endures when God asks him to sacrifice his one and only remaining son at the altar (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G22-1">
    22:1–19
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   It can be argued, then, that in this parashah the mother’s role is limited to procreation, nurturance, and physical protectiveness. Sarah, in fact, disappears from the story as soon as Abraham is rewarded for the successful test and blessed with future progeny (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G22-19">
    22:16–19
   </a>
   ). Still, as God makes clear, it is Sarah’s son, not merely Abraham’s, who is God’s chosen. Stories about Hagar and Ishmael, and about Lot’s daughters, continue the theme of threatened survival in which women ensure the safety of the next generation: God responds to Hagar’s cry for help (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G21-14">
    21:15–21
   </a>
   ); Lot’s daughters, who first appear as silent sexual objects, and whose procreative role is temporarily threatened (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G19-1">
    19:1–8
   </a>
   ), daringly initiate incestuous sexual relations with their father and secure generational continuity (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#g19-30">
    19:30–38

   ).

    Genesis 18:12

   , Sarah’s laughter at the prediction that she would soon bear a child was prompted as much by her husband’s advanced age as her own. According to Midrash

   48.18 and BT
   <i>
    Bava M’tzia

   87a, however, God’s query omitted Sarah’s reference to Abraham’s age so as to preserve good will between husband and wife, demonstrating that truth may be compromised for the sake of peace. The Rabbis also noted that Sarah was the only woman to whom God spoke directly, on account of her righteousness. When God spoke to Hagar or Rebekah, it was through an angel or an intermediary (
   <i>

These activities border on the three most serious public offenses in Jewish law: idolatry, rape, and murder. The Rabbis explained that God told Abraham to listen to Sarah’s demand to expel Hagar and Ishmael because her perceptions were inspired by prophecy (BT

   suggests that when God commanded Abraham to offer up his son, Abraham masked his intentions and informed Sarah that he was taking Isaac to study with the sages.

   , but
   <a href="08_chapter_05.xhtml#ge_23.1-20">

   will begin with her death. This juxtaposition led to the tradition that when Sarah learned that Abraham planned to offer Isaac as a sacrifice to God, she died of grief, thinking her son dead (
   <i>
    B’reishit Rabbah
   </i>
   58.5). Other versions suggest that when Satan (or the demon Samael) told Sarah that Isaac had been sacrificed, she began to weep and cried aloud three times, corresponding to the shofar’s three sustained notes (
   <i>
    t’kiah
   </i>
   ) on Rosh HaShanah, followed by three laments corresponding to the three disconnected short notes (
   <i>
    t’ruah).
   </i>
   Her soul then fled and she died (
   <i>
    Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer

    HIS EXTRAORDINARILY RICH PARASHAH
   </small>
   is filled with violence—not just the obvious and dramatic violence of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the incipient violence of the binding of Isaac, but also various, more ordinary, forms of violence against women. Half-buried in the vivid description of the people of Sodom gathering around Lot’s house and demanding the strangers staying with him is Lot’s reply, “Look—I have two daughters who have never been intimate with a man; let me bring them out for you, and do to them as you please. But do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof” (19:8). While a later midrash will see Lot’s offer as evidence that he was infected by the wickedness of Sodom and picture him as having been punished (
   <i>
    Tanchuma Vayeira
   </i>
   12), the biblical text offers no explicit judgment on his behavior. The violence of the people of Sodom merits the destruction of the city, but the willingness of Lot to see his daughters assaulted and raped is apparently unworthy of comment.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   At the beginning of
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 20
   </a>
   , we have another form of violence: the second of two stories (or two versions of the same story; see
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.10-14.24">
    12:10–20
   </a>
   ) in which Abraham seeks to pass off his wife Sarah as his sister in order to protect himself. In this passage, Abimelech, king of Gerar, seizes Sarah, but her potential rape is averted when God keeps Abimelech from touching her. The similar tale will be repeated once again in relation to Isaac and Rebekah (26:6–11). The three-fold reiteration of the narrative suggests that it might serve as a paradigm of the situation of Jewish women. The first two male ancestors of the Jews, perceiving themselves as “other” and therefore endangered in foreign lands, use their wives as buffers between themselves and the larger culture. The women become the “others’ other,” the ones whose safety and well-being can be sacrificed in order to save the patriarchs’ skins. The story names a pattern that becomes a recurring part of Jewish history: male Jews, subordinated by the dominant culture, in turn subordinate women within their own cultures, doubling the otherness that partly mirrors their own. As in the case of Lot’s offering his daughters to the people of Sodom, the biblical text offers no comment on or protest against this situation. Unlike when God appears to Abimelech in a dream and threatens him with death unless he releases Sarah (
   <a href="06_chapter_03.xhtml#ge_12.1-9">
    Genesis 12
   </a>
   ), God does not explicitly chastise Abraham or Lot.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Then, in
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#ge_18.1-21.7">
    Genesis 21
   </a>
   , we meet still another form of violence—this time Sarah’s violence against Hagar. After Sarah bears Isaac in her old age, she tells Abraham to throw the slave girl Hagar and her son Ishmael out of the house, so that Ishmael will not share in his father’s inheritance along with Isaac. The violence that is practiced by Abraham against Sarah, she now recapitulates in relation to the most vulnerable person in her own household. Thus, the cycle of abuse goes on. In this context, not only does the text not judge Sarah, but God is explicitly on her side, telling Abraham to listen to Sarah because her son Isaac will be the bearer of the covenantal line.

   This Torah portion makes clear that our ancestors are by no means always models of ethical behavior that edify and inspire us. On the contrary, often the Torah holds up a mirror to the ugliest aspects of human nature and human society. It provides us with opportunities to look honestly at ourselves and the world we have created, to reflect on destructive patterns of human relating, and to ask how we might address and change them. In Lot’s treatment of his
   <a id="page_108">
   </a>
   daughters—and in the Torah’s lack of comment on that treatment—can we see the casual acceptance, indeed the invisibility, of violence against women that is so ubiquitous in many cultures, including our own? In Abraham’s seeming lack of concern about the fate of Sarah, can we see the ways in which marginalized peoples are all too liable to duplicate patterns of subordination from which they themselves have suffered? In Sarah’s banishment of Hagar, can we see the horizontal violence that oppressed people visit on each other as they jockey for what seems to them limited resources, rather than making common cause against the forces that suppress them? And what do we do when we see ourselves enacting these patterns in our own personal and political lives? How do we respond to and interrupt them?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   It is striking that throughout the portion, God is implicated in the violence in the text. Except in the case of Lot’s willingness to sacrifice his daughters, God carries out or commands the violence (Sodom and Gomorrah; Isaac) or supports it (Abraham and Sarah; Sarah and Hagar). The representations of violence that the text holds up to us are ones on which the human and divine levels mirror each other. There is no cosmic relief, so to speak, from the reality of violence. Abraham’s challenge to God over the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah can thus be seen as a question to both God and ourselves. “Must not the Judge of all the earth do justly?” Abraham asks God. “Will You indeed sweep away the innocent along with the wicked?” (
   <a href="07_chapter_04.xhtml#G18-23">
    18:23
   </a>
   ). The implication of these questions is that it is the judge of all the earth who creates the ethical norms that Abraham reflects back to God and to which he holds God answerable. But the moral voice in this passage is Abraham’s voice. What happens to that moral vision two chapters later when Abraham betrays his wife Sarah? Can we read these narratives in ways that strengthen our resolve to hold both ourselves and God accountable to standards of justice that we recognize and value—and yet continually violate?
