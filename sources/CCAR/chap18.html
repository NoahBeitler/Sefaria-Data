   (“rules”) presents the culmination of the covenant process that began with the preparations for the revelation on Mount Sinai (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_19.1-25">
    Exodus 19
   </a>
   ). While the so-called Ten Commandments articulate the general principles of the covenant between God and Israel (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_20.1-14">
    20:1–14
   </a>
   ), this parashah presents specific stipulations. This collection of case rulings and rules, referred to as the “Book of the Covenant” (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e24-7">
    24:7
   </a>
   ), the “Covenant Code,” or the “Covenant Collection,” covers a range of topics—from criminal and civil matters like murder, assault, and theft, to moral and religious precepts, such as treatment of the stranger and observance of the festivals. Although the stipulations in this parashah address an array of subjects, they do not constitute a comprehensive legal code. Many essential aspects of life in biblical times, like marriage, adoption, or inheritance, do not appear here.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The contents of the Book of the Covenant can be divided into two groups of laws. The rules in the first group (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21">
    21:2
   </a>
   –
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-16">
    22:16
   </a>
   ) are formulated mainly as case laws, meaning that the text describes a specific scenario and its legal consequences: “When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned” (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-28">
    21:28
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   As for the second group (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-17">
    22:17
   </a>
   –
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e23-19">
    23:19
   </a>
   ), many of its regulations are phrased as unconditional imperatives, similar to language of the Decalogue: “You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk” (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e23-19">
    23:19
   </a>
   ).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   <i>
    Parashat Mishpatim
   </i>
   refers to a remarkable number of women; however, like the men in this parashah, they are not named characters but rather different types of female figures who warranted legal consideration in certain situations. We read about the wife of the Hebrew slave (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    21:3–5
   </a>
   ), the daughter sold into slavery (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-7">
    21:7–11
   </a>
   ), the mother verbally or physically abused (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-15">
    21:15
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-17">
    17
   </a>
   ), the female slave beaten by her master (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-20">
    21:20–21
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-26">
    26–27
   </a>
   ), the pregnant woman who suffers a miscarriage and possible death because of a brawl (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-22">
    21:22–25
   </a>
   ), the woman gored by an ox (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-28">
    21:28–32
   </a>
   ), the unbetrothed young woman (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-16">
    22:15–16
   </a>
   ), the sorceress condemned to death (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-17">
    22:17
   </a>
   ), and the vulnerable widow (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#chap-fn21-1a">
    22:21–23
   </a>
   ). Furthermore,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 21
   </a>
   repeatedly equates females and males regarding compensation for assault and injury (
   <a href="#exo_21.1-23.33">
    vv. 15, 16, 20, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32
   </a>
   ). This collection also treats other types of women implicitly, such as the slave owner (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21">
    21:2
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-7">
    10
   </a>
   , and elsewhere), the debtor mother (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-7">
    21:7
   </a>
   ), the impudent daughter (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-15">
    21:15
   </a>
   ), the brawler (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-18">
    21:18
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-22">
    22
   </a>
   ), the fatherless daughter (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-21">
    22:21
   </a>
   ), and more.

   After Moses communicates these stipulations to the people, they voice their enthusiastic acceptance of the terms of the covenant: “All that
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">

   has spoken we will faithfully do! (

   )” (

   ). The parashah ends with Moses’ ascent of the mountain to receive two stone tablets, the physical symbol of the new legal relationship wedding God and Israel.

   n conveying the Decalogue (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_20.1-14">
    Exodus 20:2–14
   </a>
   ), God addressed the people directly; but because the people fear the terrifying display of divine might (
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#exo_20.15-23">
    20:18–21
   </a>
   ), Moses mediates the regulations that now follow. The Book of the Covenant exhibits numerous similarities in content, form, and organization to the law collections of Israel’s neighbors. Yet biblical law departs from ancient Near Eastern jurisprudence in several ways. Israel was unique in its belief that God—not a king—authored the rules governing interactions with humans and the Divine. Another distinguishing feature is that all Israelites were charged with knowing the precepts in order to ensure their observance.
  </div>
  <div class="head2" id="exo_21.1">
   INTRODUCTION (21:1)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The inclusive nature of Israelite law is seen in this verse, when God instructs Moses to set the rules before the people. In contrast, the Laws of Hammurabi stipulate that only the aggrieved party could have the laws read to him; in Mesopotamian society, public knowledge of the law was not assumed.

  <div class="head2" id="exo_21.2-22.16">
   CIVIL AND CRIMINAL MATTERS (21:2–22:16)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   This section presents various cases involving the mistreatment of humans, livestock, or property, and the corresponding adjudications of those misdeeds. The Book of the Covenant commences with regulations concerning the emancipation of Hebrew indentured servants (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    21:2–11
   </a>
   ). While this arrangement might seem jarring at first glance—since it follows so closely after the story of the Israelites’ deliverance from bondage—it makes sense when we understand it as an attempt to limit Israelite servitude.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In what comprises the bulk of this section (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#chap-fn12-1">

   </a>
   –
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-14">
    22:14
   </a>
   ), laws are arranged according to decreasing severity, with crimes against property in the last passage. The section closes with consideration of a case of seduction (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-16">
    22:15–16
   </a>
   ).

    Treatment of Male and Female Hebrew Indentured Servants
   </i>
   (21:2–11)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en">
   Whereas the Israelites were subject to corvée labor in Egypt (see at
   <a href="16_chapter_13.xhtml#e1-11">
    1:11
   </a>
   ), this passage describes a more restricted form of indentured service, also called debt-slavery. An Israelite might be reduced to indentured servitude because of extreme poverty, debt, or in restitution for theft; the individual was not chattel owned by the master (see at v. 7).
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In comparison to other ancient Near Eastern legal collections, several regulations in this parashah are somewhat protective of servants (see
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    21:2–11
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-20">

   </a>
   ,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-28">
    32
   </a>
   ). Most biblical rulings treat male and females slaves equally (see, for instance,
   <a href="20_chapter_17.xhtml#e20-8">
    20:10
   </a>
   or

   ). Here, however, the text specifies that a male servant must be released at the end of six years, but not the indentured daughter (see at v. 7). [While this passage seems to present two contrasting laws, some interpretations—including the present translation—perceive that the unit has three parts: first, a general rule concerning the release of both female and male Hebrew indentured servants in the seventh year (v. 2, which is formulated in masculine language but represents an inclusive category); then two exceptions, one for males (vv. 3–6) and the other for daughters (vv. 7–11). This inclusive reading of v. 2 resembles
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#d15-13">
    Deuteronomy 15:12
   </a>
   , which mandates the release of a Hebrew slave regardless of gender. —

   The Hebrew wording is grammatically masculine singular. The present translation presumes that such biblical language leaves the social gender unspecified whenever it refers to a nonspecific category of persons (“you who…” or “anyone who…”). Readers or listeners then determine the intended social gender from the topic under discussion, or from other clues in the context. Here, the topic is determinative: the sense is gender inclusive because in ancient Israel, some women as well as some men owned debt-slaves; and the law has no reason to discriminate according to the owner’s gender.

   In this case, the master gives the bondsman a slave-wife, possibly of non-Israelite origin, in order to produce “house born” slaves. The mother’s status determines the children’s status, a practice that departs from the patrilineal norm in ancient Israel: if the mother is a slave, the children remain slaves. At the end of his indenture, the bondsman has to choose between continued servitude with his family or a lonely freedom. Perhaps because of the precariousness of his circumstances when freed, he might choose to stay. (For another perspective, see

The Bible tells of a widow who expects that a creditor will seize her children and force them into indentured servitude to pay off the family’s debt (II Kings 4:1). In Nehemiah 5:5, the people complain about having to sell their children in order to survive.

   According to this passage, an indentured daughter does not go free in the seventh year (v. 2) but rather stays in her master’s home where she becomes a wife or secondary wife of either the master or the master’s son. In contrast,
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#d15-13">
    Deuteronomy 15:12

   allows the Israelite woman to go free in the seventh year, but that verse may refer to a girl or woman who becomes an indentured servant with no intention of marriage. Here, marriage to the master or the master’s son seems to be the condition the father makes for the daughter’s indenture.

   What causes her to be seen, literally, as “bad in the eyes of her master”?

   These three provisions comprise the basic entitlements of a married woman. The meaning of the third term (
   <i>
    onah
   </i>
   ) is disputed; it appears nowhere else in the Bible. Some understand this word as a reference to a dwelling place (
   <i>
    ma’on).
   </i>
   Others translate the noun as “oil” or “ointment,” a reading that is based not on linguistic evidence, but on the fact that the combination of food, clothing, and oil is found in several ancient Near Eastern texts concerned with the minimal requirements for supporting a dependent. Jewish tradition considers
   <i>
    onah
   </i>
   to refer to marital relations, either for the purpose of sexual gratification or procreation, hence the translation “conjugal rights.” According to Nahum Sarna, if this interpretation is correct, “it would reflect a singular recognition in the laws of the ancient Near East that a wife is legally entitled to sexual gratification” (

   One interpretation of the phrase “three ways” is that she may leave as a free woman if the master does not allow her to be redeemed by her own family (v. 8), if he fails to treat her as a free maiden (v. 9), or if he neglects her maintenance (v. 10). Alternatively, “these three ways” could refer to “her food, her clothing, or her conjugal rights” (v. 10). In either case, if certain conditions are not met, the female servant has the ability to leave her master’s home without one of her relatives paying a redemption fee.

    ason
   </i>
   refers to harm in general, given the range of penalties mentioned in vv. 23–25. In this particular case,
   <i>
    ason
   </i>
   seems to refer specifically to the death of the mother as a result of the trauma of the assault and subsequent miscarriage. This assumption is corroborated by similar ancient Mesopotamian laws which speak first of the death of the fetus and then the death of the mother: “If a noble strikes a woman of the noble class and thereby causes her to miscarry her fetus, the perpetrator shall weigh and deliver ten shekels of silver for her fetus. If that woman should die, they shall kill the perpetrator’s daughter” (Laws of Hammurabi ¶¶ 209–10). In the Hammurabi regulation, the one who kills the pregnant woman loses a daughter. In the Torah, the attacker is required to monetarily compensate the “owner” of the fetus, the woman’s husband, with an amount of compensation to be negotiated.

   Only if the mother dies (literally “if there is an

   <i>
    nefesh
   </i>
   in place of
   <i>
    nefesh”
   </i>
   ). The relatively permissive Jewish law regarding abortion is derived from the essential distinction between the fetus and its mother. While the mother is considered a
   <i>
    nefesh
   </i>
   and her death is a capital crime, the loss of a fetus carries a lesser penalty. Similar to other cases of physical injury (vv. 18–19), the miscarriage is punished by monetary compensation.

   The legal formula for precise retribution, “eye for an eye,” has little relevance here, as this case speaks only of the miscarriage of the fetus or of the mother’s death (see at
   <a href="#exo_21.1-23.33">
    v. 22
   </a>
   ), not burns or injuries to eyes, hands, or feet. This expression was probably placed here to complete the beginning of the formula found in v. 23, “life for life,” the one part of the phrase that fits this particular case. The talion formula recurs in different contexts in
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#levi_24.22">
    Leviticus 24:17–20
   </a>
   and
   <a href="51_chapter_48.xhtml#deu19-15">
    Deuteronomy 19:21

   . According to Tikva Frymer-Kensky, this formula “must have been a judicial maxim to express the principles of equivalent retaliation” and not a mandate to inflict a penalty of bodily mutilation (“Israelite Law: State and Judiciary Law,”
   <i>
    Encyclopedia of Religion,
   </i>
   2nd ed., 2005, 7:4741). In other words, this language should not be interpreted literally. Measure-for-measure punishment is found not only in biblical law but also in narrative; this was considered God’s own way of rendering justice.

    Seduction of an Unbetrothed Woman
   </i>
   (22:15–16)
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en">
   This case concerns a young woman of marriageable age, as young as eleven or twelve, who loses her virginity to a man who did not seek her father’s permission by entering into a formal engagement and paying a betrothal gift. While scholars generally differentiate between this case, which deals with the “persuasion” of the young girl, and
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#deu22-28">
    Deuteronomy 22:28–29
   </a>
   , which deals with rape, the distinction is not clear when dealing with young women who may be too naïve to offer real consent for sexual relations. This case is positioned after a series of laws regarding property loss (likewise remedied by monetary compensation), but before a series on disruptions to the social order; it seems to share aspects with both subjects. It may reflect an ancient Near Eastern view of a daughter’s virginity as the father’s or household’s asset.

   which indicates the customary transfer of property from the groom or his family to the bride’s father (see also

    Genesis 34:12
   </a>
   and I Samuel 18:25–27), perhaps to compensate her family for the loss of her labor. The
   <i>
    mohar
   </i>
   is different from a dowry, the money or moveable property that the wife might bring to her husband and his family at marriage. Carol Meyers argues that the betrothal gift does not mean that the groom purchased the bride like chattel; therefore, the standard translation of
   <i>
    mohar
   </i>
   as “bride-price” is misleading. Instead, the dowry and betrothal gift (a better rendering of
   <i>
    mohar
   </i>
   ) helped form alliances between the two families and provided security for the woman, who theoretically retained possession of the dowry (
   <i>
    Exodus
   </i>
   , 2005, p. 197).

   Although the law requires the man to take full responsibility for his actions and marry the woman, it is understandable that a father might refuse to allow his daughter to marry the man who evaded his parental authority and seduced his daughter. In that case, the law ensures that the father’s household bears no financial loss and thus receives the betrothal gift of virgins, which would have been greater than that for widows or divorcees. The law underlines a father’s responsibility for his daughter’s sexuality.

   ASSORTED RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL PRECEPTS (22:17–23:19)

   The start of the second section of the Book of the Covenant is marked by a shift in content and style. Whereas the prior laws are formulated as hypothetical cases, many of the subsequent verses are phrased apodictically as categorical imperatives. These injunctions deal with various social and religious matters, such as questions of how to treat others and the proper way to approach God. One consequence of the notion of the divine authorship of the law is that the distinction between civil and religious law becomes blurred, as seen in this parashah.

   Biblical authors treat an attempt to learn the future as permissible so long as it is accomplished through permissible means: consultation with prophets, dream interpretation, or an oracle via the high priest’s breastplate (I Samuel 28:6). All other means—such as conjuring the spirits of the dead, interpreting the movements of clouds, or “reading” omens from the livers of sacrificial animals—fall into the category of intolerable sorcery (see next comment).

   These two classes are recognized as deserving of compassion because they have no adult male provider and protector. The term

She was left at the mercy of her children, who might have been too young to support their mother, or, in the event that she had no children, her deceased husband’s male relatives (

   While this verse is not directly addressed to women, few laws have had a greater impact on the domestic lives of Jewish women than this one, for it serves as the basis for the historic Jewish dietary practice of separating dairy and meat products. The kid, or young goat, is mentioned because it was the most common type of livestock; later Jewish law extended the prohibition to sheep and large cattle as well. In ancient Israel, meat was rarely consumed outside of special occasions—such as festivals, new moons, or perhaps the visit of an honored guest. Cooking the animal in milk instead of water would have made it tastier and more tender. (For a different theory, see at
   <a href="50_chapter_47.xhtml#chap-fn21-4">
    Deuteronomy 14:21
   </a>
   .) Most commentators point to a humanitarian motivation for this law, like the other regulations in the Torah that express a sensitivity to animals and their young (see
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e22-29">
    Exodus 22:29
   </a>
   ;
   <a href="34_chapter_31.xhtml#L22-27">

   </a>
   ;
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#chap-fn6-2">
    Deuteronomy 22:6–7
   </a>
   ). Boiling a goat in its mother’s milk, a plausible scenario on a small farm, represents the destruction of the young in the substance intended to sustain and nurture it. In order to prevent the accidental transgression of this original injunction, the rabbinic sages expanded this command into a general prohibition against mixing meat with dairy products.

   Israel is admonished in vv. 24–25 to worship the God of Israel and not adopt the religious practices of the native Canaanite population. As a reward, they will receive an array of blessings, including absence of two kinds of women: those who are incapable of conception, and those who suffer miscarriages (or, according to Rashi, those who bury their children). Fertility was considered crucial for both the individual and society for several reasons. Israel’s agrarian economy depended upon large families to perform all necessary labors. Premature mortality due to disease therefore made it necessary for women to have many children in order to ensure that some lived to adulthood. Also, a woman’s financial security depended upon having children, as seen in the book of Ruth, where the women rejoice that Ruth’s son will provide for his grandmother Naomi in her old age (Ruth 4:14–15). If a woman was widowed without children and her husband made no provisions for her, she might have no means of support, for her deceased husband’s property would be inherited by her husband’s brothers (

   depicts the ratification of the covenant between God and Israel. The central components of this ceremony involve Moses’ recitation of the terms of the covenant, the people’s unanimous agreement to follow God’s words, the construction of an altar and twelve pillars symbolizing the twelve tribes, and the offering of sacrifices, with half the blood dashed on the altar and the other half sprinkled on the people—perhaps a graphic symbol of their entry into the covenant.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   This passage also describes an unusual scene in which the leaders and representatives of the people ascend partway up the mountain, where they collectively experience a vision of God and participate in a formal meal to solemnize the covenant. Various segments of Israel’s leadership participate in this ceremony: prophetic (Moses), priestly (Aaron, his sons Nadab and Abihu), and judicial (seventy representative elders). Although women do not take part in this particular ritual, presumably they are included in the term “people” as everyone affirms, “All that
   <span class="hebrew1" dir="rtl">
    יהוה
   </span>
   has spoken we will faithfully do” (
   <a href="#exo_24.1-18">
    v. 7
   </a>
   ). The episode reaches its climax when Moses ascends the mountain and receives the stone tablets etched with God’s precepts. The tablets are to be deposited eventually in the ark of the Tabernacle, the focus of most of the remaining portion of the book of Exodus.

   (“Rules”) belies the diversity in form and content of its legal materials. For the most part, the principles of morality and ethical concern it contains reflect admirable humanitarian principles, especially when compared to similar legal materials from other ancient Near Eastern cultures. However, with respect to language, the consistent use of the masculine gender in verbal and nominal forms is problematic. Since Hebrew often uses masculine forms generically, how do we know when masculine language refers specifically to men as opposed to both men and women? The new translation in this volume is the result of scrupulous research conducted to identify masculine terms that should be understood inclusively. The English text now reads more accurately, for it reflects the fact that many legal principles apply to women as well as men.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Nonetheless, there is an important usage of the masculine singular that is not visible in this translation. The masculine singular pronoun
   <i>
    atah
   </i>
   is translated as “you.” The word “you” is gender inclusive in English; but in Hebrew
   <i>
    atah
   </i>
   sometimes refers generically to men and women, at other times, just to men.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   According to the Bible, a marital couple forms a unity. The classic evidence for this is
   <a href="04_chapter_01.xhtml#g2-18">
    Genesis 2:24
   </a>
   , which presents the astonishing statement—given the patrilocal nature of Israelite society, with brides moving to the grooms’ homes—that men are to leave their parents and become “one flesh” with their spouses. Despite a powerful concern with lineages and ancestry, the marital bond trumps the parental connection and expresses the merging of female and male.

   Thus, many biblical passages using masculine language may refer to a conjugal pair. In such cases, masculine singular pronouns like
   <i>
    atah
   </i>
   or masculine singular imperatives (“you”) are not simply inclusive terms, but reflect the special bond of husband and wife. For example, the injunction to cease from work on the seventh day (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e23-12">
    23:12
   </a>
   ) uses the masculine singular form but presumably applies to a man’s wife as well. Similarly, the prohibition against cooking a kid in its mother’s milk (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-18">
    23:19
   </a>
   ) is in the masculine singular but also applies to a man’s spouse; after all, women were largely responsible for preparing food in ancient Israel.

     When you acquire a Hebrew slave

   (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    21:2–11
   </a>
   ). Slavery was an accepted part of life in biblical and post-biblical times. Numerous Roman Empire documents and inscriptions demonstrate that Jews were slaves and slave owners. Slaves could be emancipated, but mostly within ongoing structured relationships between freed persons and their master’s/patron’s household. The provisions for treatment of slaves outlined in our parashah do not appear to have been applied by Jews in the post-biblical period, even when their slaves were also Jews.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Thus, female slaves in the post-biblical period did not enjoy the protections of
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-7">
    Exodus 21:9–11
   </a>
   , which considers female slavery as leading to marriage and refers to a woman’s conjugal rights. Rather, rabbinic
   <a id="page_446">
   </a>
   legislation, like Roman law, considered slavery a deficient status. A Jewish slave woman could not form a legal marriage with her Jewish sexual partner, whether a slave or a free man, and the offspring of such a union were slaves (Mishnah
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   3:12). The likelihood of sexual relations between female slaves and various males in the master’s household was assumed. Rabbinic texts tacitly recognized that women slaves were sexually available to their owners, as in the maxim “the more women slaves, the more unchastity” (Mishnah
   <i>
    Avot
   </i>
   2:7). This warning addresses the distraction that female slaves posed to the male scholar.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Emancipation affected men and women differently. The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (1st century
   <small>
    C.E.)
   </small>
   described a Jew who was taken as a slave to Rome and married a captive virgin at the command of his master, Emperor Vespasian (
   <i>
    Life
   </i>
   414–15). At the moment that the male slave was freed, they separated, and later he married again. The first woman was apparently an appropriate wife for a slave, but not for a free man.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Rabbinic law presumed that female slaves and freed women were no longer virgins. Thus, even if a slave woman was emancipated, the legal minimum value of her marriage settlement (
   <i>
    k’tubah
   </i>
   ) would be half that of an unmarried free woman. Although the liberation story of Exodus was always a central focus of Judaism, few commentators have struggled with the larger issues of enslavement that continued for centuries in Jewish societies.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Rabbinic Judaism did place a premium on
   <i>
    pidyon sh’vuyim,
   </i>
   the redemption of Jewish captives who were at risk of being sold into slavery. BT
   <i>
    Bava Batra
   </i>
   8a-b asks: “Since Rabbi Samuel ben Judah has laid down that money for
   <i>
    tzedakah
   </i>
   is not to be levied from the fatherless even for the redemption of captives,’ should we not conclude that redeeming captives is a religious duty of great importance?” The Rabbis insisted that in most cases women were to be redeemed from slavery before men, in order to preserve the women from dishonor (Mishnah
   <i>
    Horayot
   </i>
   3:7; BT
   <i>
    Horayot
   </i>
   13a). If a woman testified that a fellow female prisoner, the wife of a priest, was not raped in captivity, her testimony was believed, even though women’s testimony was generally not admissible in rabbinic courts (Mishnah
   <i>
    K’tubot
   </i>
   2:6; BT
   <i>
    K’tubot
   </i>
   27b). This meant the undefiled woman could return to her husband.

   (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-22">

   ). The phrase
   <i>
    if other damage ensues
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#exo_21.1-23.33">
    v. 23
   </a>
   ) played a critical role in shaping rabbinic attitudes about abortion (Daniel Schiff,
   <i>
    Abortion in Judaism,
   </i>
   2002). In the Torah,
   <i>
    a miscarriage results, but no other damage
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#exo_21.1-23.33">
    v. 22
   </a>
   ) is contrasted with the potential
   <i>
    other damage
   </i>
   (
   <a href="#exo_21.1-23.33">
    v. 23
   </a>
   ), an apparent reference to the death of the woman. This formulation suggests that only mortal injury to the pregnant woman is considered homicide. However, Jews who translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek (3rd century
   <small>
    B.C.E.)
   </small>
   understood the import of these verses differently. Instead of contrasting the death of the fetus and the death of the mother, the Septuagint (Greek translation) renders
   <i>
    ason
   </i>
   as “formed,” distinguishing the death of an “imperfectly formed” fetus (
   <a href="#exo_21.1-23.33">
    v. 22
   </a>
   ) from that of a “perfectly formed” fetus (
   <a href="#exo_21.1-23.33">
    v. 23
   </a>
   ). Thus, this translation considers the violently induced miscarriage of a completely formed fetus as homicide.

   Rabbinic interpretation, however, follows the Hebrew text; therefore, the Rabbis drew a clear distinction between the monetary penalty for one who kills a fetus, and the capital penalty for one who causes a woman’s death. The Rabbis considered elsewhere the existence and formation of a fetus once it had reached forty days, but they stopped short of declaring it a
   <i>
    nefesh,
   </i>
   a legal human life. Despite the complexity and ambiguity in many of their discussions of abortion, the Rabbis specifically legislated aborting a fetus if its continued existence threatened the pregnant woman’s life (Mishnah

   the Torah’s first law collection, which—unlike all other ancient Near-Eastern law collections—begins with regulations concerning slavery. The Torah seems unable to imagine an economy without slaves, but it frowns upon Hebrew slavery. Consequently, for Israelites in debt,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 21:2–6
   </a>
   prescribes indentured servitude, but limited to six years. If a man enters debt-slavery while married, the master must let his wife go when he is released. However, if the master gives him a slave wife, the master retains the wife and children. What happens if the debt-slave declares, “I love my master and my wife and children: I do not wish to go free” (
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    21:5
   </a>
   )? He then has his earlobe pierced with an awl, and he becomes a slave in perpetuity, which the Rabbis interpret to mean until the Jubilee, or fiftieth, year.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   Liberal readers are often sympathetic to this noble fellow who relinquishes his freedom to stay with his slave wife and children. But how would this case look from the perspective of the slave wife? I will argue that it looks much different. Who is this slave woman? She is not the
   <i>
    amah ivriyah
   </i>
   (Hebrew indentured servant) the text speaks about in
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-7">
    21:7–12
   </a>
   . In that case, a girl has been sold by a presumably impoverished Israelite parent into a wealthier family on the understanding that she will eventually be married to the master or one of his sons as a free woman. This practice is well attested in other ancient Near Eastern documents. Should the man take another wife, he must continue to support her. An Israelite woman may not be resold if her owner is displeased with her; instead, she must go free without any compensation to the master. Her servitude, too, is time limited.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In contrast, the slave woman in
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#exo_21.1-23.33">
    Exodus 21:5–6
   </a>
   is most likely a foreign bondswoman. As a non-Israelite, she will not become part of the master’s family, and her slavery is perpetual, not limited. As property, she and a male Israelite slave can be mated by the master to breed more slaves, which cannot be done to an Israelite handmaiden. The foreign bondswoman does not choose her husband and cannot reject him. Both he and her children can be taken from her. As we learn from
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-20">
    Exodus 21:20
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="21_chapter-18.xhtml#e21-26">
    26–27
   </a>
   , her very body is at risk, for masters may beat their own slaves without legal interference as long as they do not kill them or destroy a major body part. (Slave narratives from different parts of the world confirm that slaves were, and are, routinely battered and then expected to work. They may work less efficiently, but historically this has not been a sufficient disincentive to masters. The law cannot be said to permit battery of slaves; it is simply uninterested in such battery unless it results in major damage or death.)

   While the Israelite slave must be freed at the start of the seventh year, how might the foreign bondswoman obtain her freedom? There are three options: First, she could save money given to her as a reward or a wage. If, with her owner’s permission, she contracts herself out for pay after finishing her other work, she might be able to accumulate money to buy her freedom. Mesopotamian records show that slaves were able to gain extra money as artisans and agents (see Gregory Chirichigno,
   <i>
    Debt-Slavery in Israel and the Ancient Near East,
   </i>
   1993, p. 54); this practice might have existed in ancient Israel as well. Second, she could run away.
   <a href="52_chapter_49.xhtml#chap-fn16-5">
    Deuteronomy 23:16–17
   </a>
   says that a fugitive slave may not be returned to the owner. Third, an Israelite slave husband once released could buy his slave wife and children and free them. African-American history shows examples of former slaves who bought spouses
   <a id="page_448">
   </a>
   and children or arranged for them to be secretly stolen and led to freedom. Harriet Tubman, whose code name was “Moses,” had a long career of gathering slaves and leading them North. Implicit in these narratives is a desperate determination to be free.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   In contrast, what does the Israelite slave husband accomplish by pledging himself to perpetual slavery? When he declares that he loves his wife and children, it is not a happy, free family he is talking about. He cannot insure that his family will remain intact. His wife and children could be sold at any time. Even when his family is united, all will suffer the terrible humiliations of slavery: lack of choice, being objectified as property, being brutalized without recourse. Will the slave-wife appreciate his sinking into helplessness and hopelessness alongside her, especially if she was counting on his determination to free her once he was freed?
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   When the debt-slave professes his love for his master (whom he mentions before his slave family in
   <a href="#exo_21.1-23.33">
    v. 5
   </a>
   ), what kind of love is this? It is a love of dependency, of not having to make decisions, of not having to struggle for a living, to choose a wife, or take responsibility for one’s children. Beyond that, embracing slavery undoes the liberation from Egypt and rejects the liberating God. In BT
   <i>
    Kiddushin
   </i>
   22b, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai explains why this man’s ear is pierced with an awl: “The Holy One says, ‘The ear that heard on Mount Sinai when I said, ‘the people of Israel are my servants and not servants of servants’ and went and got himself a human master, let that ear be pierced.’”
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The bondswoman is not where she is because she volunteered to be a slave. Most likely, she is a captive taken in war, well schooled in the corrosive bitterness of slavery. She might see the Hebrew slave’s renunciation of freedom not as a romantic gesture, but as a naïve, even stupid one. He has surrendered his power to free her or their children. He may have been her best chance for freedom.
  </div>
  <div class="tab-en1">
   The Torah is truthful with us, although that truth does not always make us happy. Ancient Near Eastern law could not imagine a world without slavery; yet Israelite law wanted the people to remain free of all human appropriation. That dilemma resulted in the preservation of this vignette about the conflicting loyalties of the Israelite slave. By highlighting the shadowy woman in the background, we get a rare, ironic glimpse of the dilemma from her usually invisible point of view.
